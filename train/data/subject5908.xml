    <TEXT>I love photography, I used to have some pretty good gears, even stuff I would normally never use, like this lens, but keep it just in case one day the mood stroke and/or whatever. In fact when the idea of visiting some friends in Brazil came up I thought this would be a great occasion to take this big tele lens with me and possibly take some pictures of the local wildlife. On the second day I was there, while walking in a good part of town, a motorcycle rode over the sidewalk and stopped right in front of me, two guys on it, one pointed a gun right in my face and said something I had no idea what it meant but he pointed his finger at my backpack. I just handed it to him without blinking, his friend in the back took it and they flew off back on the street, gone. They had no idea what was inside, I did! That lens, more or less 2400 euros (actually cheaper now on Amazon since I bought it), a macro lens ( #8364;800), and a relatively cheap walk-around lens ( #8364;450), not to mention the camera, Canon 5d mark ii (over  #8364;3400 when I bought it). Not long ago there was a video posted here on Reddit about a guy riding his motorbike in Sao Paulo and something like what happened to me happened to him, they wanted his bike, in his case a cop saw everything and shot one of the guys. Apparently it's pretty common in Brazil. **edit** Here's the video I was talking about https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCOIB6zbED0</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You're completely right, the relatively positive side of it was that I didn't even had the chance to take pictures since I just got there, all the previous photos were dumped on my home computer before departure, so all the mem cards were empty.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This one time I was traveling overseas and while checking in at the airport I was asked if I wanted to upgrade to first class for a $100, I say yeah why not, the flight was going to be a long one and I don't travel much. So, I board the plane and take my sit, 30 seconds later this gorgeous woman take the seat next to mine, and by gorgeous I mean she was a 10 on the top model scale. She smiled at me and I smiled back, from there we started talking... fuck I make it short cause I need to take a shit and the turtle's head it's already poking out of its shell. So we talked for a good two blissful hours when during the conversation I told her that was my first time flying first class, she asked if I ever joined the mile high club, never heard of that term before, I thought it was some sort of expensive club for frequent flyers so like a fucking idiot I told her nope can't afford that type of thing, she giggles and as she gets closer she whispers "it's your lucky day, I go to the restroom, wait 2 minuets and come in". I went, we fucked, she sucked me and I spludge all over her breathtaking tits. I finger banged her for the rest of the flight and before landing we fucked again in the lavatory. And that's how I got chlamydia.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There's a video that still give me chills down my spine just thinking about it, is not graphic per se but what happened is horrifying. A guy and woman are driving, from the camera point of view you can only see the road and maybe a bit of steering wheel. Everything is normal when suddenly a a brick comes flying into the windshield hitting the passenger side, the girl is killed instantly, a split second later the guy sees what just happened and his cry surpass any nastiness I've seen on the web, no gore pictures or videos can make my stomach clench as the horrifying sound of the man coming to realization that passenger was killed in an instant. I think this is the video, I can't watch it so I assume by the description is the one I'm talking about. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iazTQVi1CEE It's really NSFL</TEXT>

    <TEXT>She made a comment that really upset me. Our family dog was 13 years old when she passed away, we got her as a gift to my father, I'm not going into details about the reason but anyway, my father was really attached to this dog and so was the dog to my father, 8 years later my father passed away, you can't imagine the dog's reaction, just imagine, every evening the dog waited at the door for my dad to come home and play with her, but my that never came... Few more years have passed, one day we were all at home, by all I mean me, my mom and my girlfriend, we were in the kitchen preparing dinner, helping m aroudn and what not, then the dog asked to go outside to do her business, I let her and waited for her to get back inside, she did and with her funny way of walking she got in and hopped on the sofa, she always sat in the same spot where my dad used to sit. Nothing usual, I walked back to the kitchen, from that position she could see us working on the lasagna, in fact as I glanced I see her lying down on the pillow, staring at us. About 20 minutes has passed and I see she's still looking at us, unusual since she's always active and at most she can stay still for no more than 2 minutes, anyway I kept helping in the kitchen. Another 15 minutes and I see her staring, I call her and she doesn't move, my mom calls her, nothing, we even joked about it... I call her again and as I walked to her I notice her eyes are frozen in the kitchen's direction, I get a really weird feeling, can't describe it, I touch her and I feel her warmth but right away I perceive she's gone, she didn't look like but she was gone. I don't have to tell you how my mom and I reacted, I think you can imagine it, lots of tears, lots of memories. While I'm holding the dog I seek for my girlfriend for solace, I look at her and she goes "jeez people, it's just a dog!!!" as she rolled her eyes. FUUUCK YOU BITCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>this happened to me in more than one occasion. Dated girl for almost two months, awesome time spent together, even more awesome was the sex, then poof, disappeared... I had to know goddammit! You know what happened, I was a rebound. She broke up with her boyfriend something like 4 or 5 months before we started dating, despite having a good feeling being with me she was still in love with the guy. Another time... things are going well, I'm happy 'cause you know, you think something good is developing. Again, she disappears into the void, fuck that I had to know WHY!!! She said she thought things were too good to be true, therefore she expected something bad to happen in oru future relationship. It's nuts I know. I've got another one, again, incredibly good dates, sex, everything, then the recurrent disappearance. This time I didn't ask and the answer I got was seeing her a week later at the same restaurant I took her a couple of times, witch she loved according to her, with some other dude tenderly holding hands and kissing, I guess he had some better qualities than me that fit her book. It's a mess, right now I'm dating this girl that seems alright but I'm keeping my expectation down low, fool me once...</TEXT>

    <TEXT>not necessarily, I had an acquaintance that started to work as a stripper in San Francisco right after high school, she did some crappy nude modeling and got invited at a playboy photo shoot, did some escorting as well, cash was good and I really thought she would do porn, but she never got into porn, her girlfriend yes, she did a couple of soft core videos but that's all. Eventually at the age of 26 her career as stripper declined and she got into college to study journalism, she sucks at writing but she got a good job after graduating, when she needs extra cash she does bachelor parties including sexual services, she's got interesting stories. Pity I'm not in touch with her anymore.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Quite some time a go an okcupid employee here explained that the red-yellow-green is not really about how frequent a user replies to messages but actually how many messages a user receives in a particular time frame. Just some number to give an idea. 0-10 - green 11-20 - yellow 21 and up -red Since guys receive a lot less unsolicited messages most of them are green even if they never reply. on the other hand, almost all women are red. Sometimes it's funny to see a new female user with a green bar go through yellow and red in a matter of minutes because she was pestered with messages. So, there's that the replies selectively means jack shit.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>3ds Max was the first 3d software I used and that was a loooong time ago (DOS), then I tried pretty much every other software in existence since then, keep in mind it's always been just for fun. I'm so used to 3ds Max, perhaps now I'm just lazy to learn anything else, it does what I need and since it's not my job I'm happy with it. I also like to use Rhino 3d, Mudbox, Zbrush although I hate the UI, and sporadically Maya, I like it for rigging characters and animation a lot more over Max. Modo is ok to me, I tried it and I sort of like it but again, for my needs 3ds Max is perfectly fine. The one that I personally can't wrap my mind around is Blender, the least intuitive piece of software I ever tried to use, and even when you start to barely understand its commands for the most basic things.. I get headaches just thinking about it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Mine did the same thing, he'd been with us for 8 years when he disappeared, we thought it died, months later after he was gone we move to a new apartment, although not far from the one we lived in, then out of the blue our cat showed up, well fed, well groomed and walked right in like he owned the place, I don't remember how long exactly he was gone but it had to be at least a 12 even 14 months... that mother fucker.</TEXT>

The fly got in, I put down the camera the camera on my desk and forgot about it, few days later it was a nasty surprise to see a bunch of dark spots appearing in my pictures, that fly shat everywhere inside the camera, then, pieces of the dead insects started getting everywhere and a bunch of problems with the mirror and shutter mechanism. Such little bug caused such expenses for repair, bastard.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>See, this is the shit that bothers me about imgur and their .gifv/webm videos, before you had a 2MB limit on gif, then it was raised up to 5MB (I think) so you had to get creative with compression and color palette, sure more often than not you'd get shitty quality gifs but they were somewhat fast to load and easy to share since the format has been around for decades and can be viewed pretty much in every device... but now you upload a video that gets "converted" into a gifv and you get a fast loading "gif"... cool let me save this "gif" on my drive and add it to my collection, hit download...

    <TEXT>imgur use to have a 2mb upload limit on gif files, then if you had registered an account it was 4 or maybe 5mb limit, the beauty of the 2mb limit was that a gif maker had to carefully craft each frame, from its size to its compression, how many frames etc... and hopefully get a decent quality out of all that. Now, you just upload a video, imgur converts it to gifv, which is actually a video file in webm format, and then a gif file that, in order to keep it good to the eye, it's fucking huge in size!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The Murray Gell-Mann amnesia effect. From the late Michael Crichton #8217;s 2002 essay  #8220;Why Speculate? #8221; "Media carries with it a credibility that is totally undeserved. You have all experienced this, in what I call the Murray Gell-Mann Amnesia effect. (I call it by this name because I once discussed it with Murray Gell-Mann, and by dropping a famous name I imply greater importance to myself, and to the effect, than it would otherwise have.) Briefly stated, the Gell-Mann Amnesia effect works as follows. You open the newspaper to an article on some subject you know well. In Murray #8217;s case, physics. In mine, show business. You read the article and see the journalist has absolutely no understanding of either the facts or the issues. Often, the article is so wrong it actually presents the story backward-reversing cause and effect. I call these the  #8220;wet streets cause rain #8221; stories. Paper #8217;s full of them. In any case, you read with exasperation or amusement the multiple errors in a story-and then turn the page to national or international affairs, and read with renewed interest as if the rest of the newspaper was somehow more accurate about far-off Palestine than it was about the story you just read. You turn the page, and forget what you know. That is the Gell-Mann Amnesia effect. I #8217;d point out it does not operate in other arenas of life. In ordinary life, if somebody consistently exaggerates or lies to you, you soon discount everything they say. In court, there is the legal doctrine of falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus, which means untruthful in one part, untruthful in all. But when it comes to the media, we believe against evidence that it is probably worth our time to read other parts of the paper. When, in fact, it almost certainly isn #8217;t. The only possible explanation for our behavior is amnesia."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I met a girl off Tinder, we hit it off pretty good, she's one of these girls that are out of my league, if we didn't meet I'd be pretty sure she was a catfish, anyway... we went out on three dates and the chemistry was there, I made my move, things went quite well... except, her scent was strong, as soon as she removed her panties I got punched in the nose by a smell that... wasn't right. But fuck I was in a dry spell and so horny that I held my breath and went right in...it was bed, no muff diving for me, so we moved to regular intercourse... she was horrible, from behind she woudl arch her back and I woudl hit her pelvic bone with my dick, not to mention I was slipping out every third or fourth thrust, I tried to push her back down to get a better angle of penetration but nope, not happening. BJ time... I think she had a small mouth, or I don't know, I felt all her teeth scraping my glans and the shaft, she wanted to be gagged and face fucked and I was fuck yeah jackpot, I never had a gf that was into that... nope even this was not good, her teeth kept bothering me, it was actually borderline painful. I gave up trying that night. She was gorgeous and I never had a girlfriend that beautiful, perfect body, great tits and ass, because of that I dated her for 8 months hoping things would get better in the sex department, no luck, her smell wasn't cause by any medical condition, it was just her natural scent, all her body had a very pungent smell, maybe it was a combination of perfumes, body lotions, soaps or wherever she was using that didn't mix well together or with her skin I don't know, I know the smell was a major turn off, the idea of going down on her was repulsive, I couldn't ever touch her pussy with my hands it felt disgusting in my head, fuck I loved to have the smell of pussy juices on my face but that wasn't the case. It caused me some sort of PTSD, after dating I thought I was gonna have real troubles with other girls, luckily everything went back to normal with me right after I had sex with another girl and she smelled/tasted as expected.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The smell was of cooked onions, slightly burned and left in the pan overnight, that's the smell, her whole body had that smell, a lot stronger in her genital area but I could smell it on her neck and other places, oh and railing her from behind was so bad I often gagged. I honestly think that's her natural scent, or perhaps I'm more sensitive to it, although in more than one occasion she was telling me how unlucky she was that all the men she dated would never go down on her, she thought men love to eat pussy, kind strange she had such bad luck meeting guys that didn't like it... eh, I know why. edit: I dated girls that occasionally had the fishy smell, nothing as bad as hers though.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No one mentioned [Red Dog?](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0803061/?ref_=nv_sr_1) From wikipedia. Story basis Red Dog (c. 1971  #8211; 21 November 1979) was a Kelpie/cattle dog cross who was well known for his travels through Western Australia's Pilbara region. There is a statue in his memory in Dampier, which is one of the towns to which he often returned. Red Dog is believed to have been born in the town of Paraburdoo in 1971 and had a variety of names to those who knew him, including: Bluey, Tally Ho, and Dog of the Northwest. Soon after Red's death in 1979, Australian author Nancy Gillespie wrote and compiled anecdotes and poetry written by several people of the Pilbara region for her book Red Dog as did Beverly Duckett in her 1993 book Red Dog: The Pilbara Wanderer. Red Dog's statue has caught the attention of a number of people passing through Dampier including British author Louis de Berni #232;res, who was inspired to write a book loosely based on Red's legend called Red Dog. A four-wheel-drive club has been named in his honour.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A couple of years ago I was dating this beautiful polish girl, she has a kid that back then was 10, the first time she invited me to her place her son was having a sleepover, 3 kids playing videogames and watching movies. We went upstairs to her bedroom to have some adult fun, the thing was that I could hear the kids down below playing and talking, it was a bit distracting, however when she showed me her tits and horniness took over her room became pound town. She was loud, moaning, dirty talking... the kids heard it all, I felt bad for her kid and I'm sure even though the tv volume got considerably up it could not cover her mom's loud orgasms.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Same here, I started way back with 3ds Max when it run on DOS, than Maya and other now forgotten 3d programs that's how old I am. I now use Rhino, Solidworks, Cinema 4d and still 3ds Max, I tried Blender, I spent time on it and I really wanted to like it but, for me and my approach to such programs, it was the least intuitive piece of software I ever used. I truly appreciate whoever use it to such levels, kudos to them.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You just made me think of my ex, she got super fucking mad at me on the morning of her birthday.. I woke up, it was few minuets past 6, very early for us, she was still sleeping, I got up and went to the bathroom to piss, I then went back to our bedroom because I needed something from the closet, I'll explain later, but as I stepped into the room she was up staring at me from the bed giving me the evil eye. I didn't have time to say a word that she started yelling at me telling me I'm the worst boyfriend ever because I forgot it was her birthday and I didn't wish her a happy birthday when I woke up. The fact that I planned our breakfast in bed and I was going to get her birthday present that I hid in the closet to then go to the kitchen and prepare breakfast wasn't a good proof that I did indeed remember of her bday. Apparently hee idea was that as soon as she opened her eyes I was supposed to be there next to her ready to say happy birthday. Fucking A she was crazy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not necessarily, my ex girlfriends family was a bunch of rednecks, her aunt was like the ladies in this video, her name is Becky and even her kins thought she's a bitch. Her and her husband would act just like we see here every time they got the chance, I'd say it was on a daily basis, they have 4 children and this behavior was not toned down a bit in front of them, when I met them they were about of age 4, 6, 13, and 18, I spent 7 years around this family and unbelievably all the kids were the nicest and most polite kids I have never met, despite the constant profanities ejaculated by the parents' mouths. Has been many years and they are all adults now, last time I checked the two oldest ones became a physicians and a dental hygienists respectively.</TEXT>
