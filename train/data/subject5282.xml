    <TEXT>Thought Fernandez was the best. Helps it's a double save but it's a moving, deflected ball on the first shot then a extended foot save on the rebound, not just getting hit in the body.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> #8220;It is good in a certain way for the team because you have two keepers who are battling every day, battling for the position. It #8217;s great. Chris came in and he was huge in the game. Then, Raul came and did the same. One thing I #8217;m sure is that either will do an excellent job for this team, #8221; Pareja said.  #8220;We #8217;re at that level right now and they know that I #8217;m not afraid to put one or another. I have plenty of confidence in both. At this point, it comes down also to who #8217;s healthier and who #8217;s physically healthier.

    <TEXT>Know it's an unpopular opinion but I think it's reasonable that the team that handled Howard so poorly could have also misled him with false information. If you look at Friedel's tweets (hate to cite Twitter but you know) he walks a fine line of defending himself without trashing Howard, which would be easy to do at this point. Friedel has supported Howard in the past so it'd be out of character for him to have done this. If Friedel is right, isn't saying Howard was a liar, just misinformed.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Friedel on signing the letter:  gt;"I said, 'Sure.' It was sent to me, and the only thing that was true on it was my name. The letter was full of exaggerations that the people on the PFA [Professional Footballers' Association] and appeals committee would have seen through... Yes, I refused to sign that. We got the letter and said 'We have to change this, because this isn't true.' We made our changes and sent it back. They didn't like what I was going to sign, so they didn't use it. And that was the end of the matter." So I guess the question now is what was on there that wasn't true. As for the personal encounter, BF says the principle Howard mentions of blocking him wasn't like that:  gt;"The 'principle' that I was talking about was I couldn't sign the letter based on principle because it was full of lies." Both sides have differing arguments and there's not any reason to believe one over the other at the moment. Just a he-said-she-said situation.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I wrote the article. Thanks for those who took interest to it. Just to clarify some things, and honestly thanks for all the critique, but the under-40th draft pick point was more of a interesting note that I saw that unfortunately got tweaked whenever it went into editing. There have been 501 collective starts from goalkeepers after the 40th pick versus 408 starts from under 40. I don't really know what that means, probably just a small sample size but thought it was worth pointing out. (And yes more post-40 draft picks have washed out but of the ones that have earned one start, there are 12 for each side of the 40th pick line.) Also there should be more emphasis on how many current MLS gks went undrafted. That's why I was pointing out how many wash out. Maybe should have led with that. Thanks again for all the comments. Really enjoyed the Pokemon one by midwestern.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hands are way too low from distances over six yards!! Get those hands up and quit scrunching your body. Think, "Can I get beat low if my hands are at my belly button?" If yes, drop them until you feel comfortable. From 15+ yards out, get them at belly button height. The closer the striker gets to you, the lower you drop your hands but don't just automatically place them even with your shins because it's comfortable. Solid hands, like the spring, quick feet. But get those hands up! How's your distribution/communication? Can you kick accurately with your strong foot  gt;40 yards? Can you kick with your weak foot  gt;40 yards? Can you quickly alert your defenders with short, efficient phrases? Are you aiding the offense verbally at all?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey I wrote this. Me, Bill Reno. (@letsallsoccer) First off, thanks for all the feedback. When I wrote that back in August, I almost got no response so I was glad to see comments here. A few things - Clark is a really good comparison. Very similar technique and is prone to great plays and unfortunate mistakes. I will say Clark's errors seem to be in more variety than Hamid's. Also correct on Clark's passing accuracy. Was best in the league in 2015. - Fans and media need to get on the same page for critiquing Hamid and EPL gks. Hamid is a good MLS gk but there's another level for him to reach in order to play in the best league in the world. Everyone is quick to say Hamid is athletic, which is obviously true, but most struggle to comment on any other part of his game. - For more evidence on Hamid's weaknesses, he got lit up vs. Columbus in the last season game (5-0) that exposed the same issues again. First leg vs. RBNY he doesn't come out to get a driven ball he could have got and the second leg we see 1v1 problems on the goal again. Also gave no communication to help with the counter. - Some mentioned his continuing growth. He is much better than 2012 but honestly a gk is usually very close to fully developed by 25. Maybe Hamid beats the odds, I hope so, but he's not on pace for EPL imo. TLDR Hamid has his issues as a gk but if started for the US tomorrow I wouldn't have a problem with it. Would also recommend to click the about page on sites to find if it's a credible writer or not : / Let me know if you have any questions! Would love to talk about anything Hamid or gks.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>FC Dallas response for security issues [second leg vs. Portland]</TITLE>
    <DATE>2015-12-01 07:35:11</DATE>
    <TEXT>I was one of the many who went to the second leg vs. Portland and did not enter the stadium well into the game. My friend was actually carrying a cigarette lighter and set off the metal scanner. When they asked him what it was he said "nothing" and they said "okay" and let him in. It seemed like an appropriate ending to the excessive wait. Ha. So after not seeing anything from the club, I have finally seen a response from the front office. I received this email on Monday, which I'm sure others did too. I thought it was a nice gesture to some extent but obviously doesn't completely erase bigger issues. -------------------------------------------------------- FC Dallas Fan, We have been in touch with many of you individually today as you #8217;ve reached out to share your specific concerns regarding last night #8217;s stadium security delays. We also recognize that there are many of you whom we have not heard from that likely share the same sentiments as those we #8217;ve spoken to. We sincerely apologize for any, and all, inconvenience. Regardless, we are reaching out to you as a collective group because our ticket scan records indicate that you were affected adversely by the security measures that were taken at Toyota Stadium last night. These factors resulted in you either entering into the match late or experiencing a less than friendly fan ingress. There was a confluence of factors that are more comprehensive than what is commonly considered, which played into why some of the delay occurred. We don #8217;t offer this as any excuse or rationalization because some of those factors could have, and should have, been navigated better. We own that and will learn from that. The priority last night was a safe building and environment for the fans attending, and while we #8217;re glad that proved to be the case; we apologize again for things that led to what occurred. Your support is appreciated and any frustration you felt is understood and recognized. As a show of understanding, we would like to offer each of you your choice of two options as we go into the 2016 season. 1. A one-time 50% off coupon to purchase up to eight (8) 2016 single-match tickets - You will receive a special code one week before single-match tickets go on sale in January/February of 2016 2. An equal number of complimentary tickets to what you paid for last night to one of our two CONCACAF Champions League group stage matches at Toyota Stadium. These matches are not determined by date or time yet, but they will be played in late August or early September of 2016 - You will receive notification of the two games when they are announced and scheduled in late spring 2016, allowing you to then select which of the two matches you would like to attend As an organization, we couldn #8217;t be more proud of the accomplishments of the team this season #8230; - 1st Place in the Western Conference, tied for - Qualifying for the 2016-17 CONCACAF Champions - Two (2) of the MLS Best XI players in Fabian Castillo [sic?] - Best home record in Major League Soccer - Most regular season points in club history with  #8230;and much more. It would be our sincere pleasure to host you at Toyota Stadium for a match here soon, as the first matches of 2016 are less than 100 days away. Thanks for your support!</TEXT>

I agree with most of them but also agree with you, spectre, that the Fiji Mermaid has a double meaning. I could see it just encompassing the circus' grand allure as a whole but I like your take on it too. I think the line of the dress / horse at the end is referencing both the literal Fiji Mermaid (the last great attraction in the circus) and the metaphorical one (whether the circus or just mindset). Ultimately he sees the circus is failing but he can #8217;t give it up because of some misplaced hope or something else.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Question about "emo pop"</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-01-29 20:31:35</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm having trouble drawing the lines on what is an is not emo pop. First off, there doesn't seem to be a consensus on if you can have an emo pop album and not be emo at the same time. I know that might sound silly but many bands are tagged as specifically not emo while having albums classified as emo pop. (Fall Out Boy, stands out here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Emo/comments/32ayko/map_of_emo/ but even bands like Mae, AAR, Jack's Mannequin are good examples.) Even within the emo pop genre, we're still spanning a good deal of sound. Modern Baseball, Joyce Manor, and The Promise Ring are all pretty different in sound but I'd say they're actually closer in sound to non-emo bands than they are to each other. (That's not a question that's just me talking.) My second question is what are the bordering non-emo genres on emo pop? So obviously emo pop isn't close to jazz or anything but it's not a stretch to say that modern pop punk and power pop aren't too far removed from emo pop. I know talking about music is tricky but what makes a band be just enough emo pop or not enough emo pop? (Depending on what other genre you're pushing it to) Not really a question but just a thought: it seems like emo pop is much more vague in classifying than the rest of the emo subgenres. I think if you look at the sidebar even, there seems to be a vague understanding of what "emo pop" really entails. "Midwest emo and pop punk and/or power pop/indie pop." That covers a lot of ground and, imo, opens itself up to be widely used without any real lines drawn. I know it takes time to really form a genre but it seems like it's been 20 years and no one really knows what emo pop still is, not to mention current emo pop bands were called pop punk or post-hardcore for most of that time. And for me personally, I wouldn't even call Joyce or Modern Bball emo pop. I think there are better terms to use for them. I think some similar questions can be asked about the emo revival bands rn but I'll wait on that. Recap 1. Can you make an emo pop record but not be emo? 2. What are emo pops' neighboring genres that aren't also an emo sub-genre? (And, if possible, what makes them not emo pop?)</TEXT>

From Buber's wiki bio... "was an Austrian-born Israeli Jewish philosopher best known for his philosophy of dialogue, a form of existentialism centered on the distinction between the I #8211;Thou relationship and the I #8211;It relationship" I think you can see some of Aaron's lyrics and general comments/attitudes parallel with Buber's if you skip down towards the Zionist section and the philosophy part too.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey appreciate the responses. I think if someone has really watched Solo over the last four years, they would see the drop off in her game. In the air, she's very suspect and seems to bobble more than play correctly whenever she's under pressure. But because the US is so good in the air it doesn't really matter and she can get away with being weak in that part of her game. Mechanically she's gotten pretty sloppy, especially with her footwork. It's a very heroic/big save-approach, and not calculated. Overall, I wouldn't say 14 is awful. It's just more of a credit to the rest of the world for producing good goalkeepers. Those top 13 are really, really good and Solo is on the decline of her career. Same thing for Emma Byrne. She's 36. Not a ton of time left but there's not really anyone to unseat her for Ireland just yet. Kiedrzynek still has some room to grow and I think that's pretty evident in the 7-0 loss to Lyon: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sezFWfc6-S8 Yes, Lyon is good but that doesn't excuse her continually conceding position by overplaying her hand. Although there definitely is a next level for her to reach that she will over the next 2-3 years. College is a solid prep but the competition level is pretty low compared to professional leagues. Every year seniors don't continue their playing career not because they just don't want to, but because most of them can't make the next level. If they could, Americans would litter every league overseas but instead it's very hard to make that jump.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah it was just hard to write more for each tier, which I guess furthers your point. 51-100 are a less iconic as as those starting over them. So it'd be a lot of "they're going to be good" and hard to really show/say why/how. But that's a good point. Personally just like doing 100  gt; 50. I've done it for a couple other lists and it was just a little more enjoyable making a full list.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Appreciate the comment! If there are stats to look at please point them my way, ha. I couldn't find any. I would say I've watched video on almost all 100 gks and just had to rate them that way. But you're definitely right in that there is a lot to rating a gk. Communication is a huge one but is nearly impossible to know from the outside looking in. If you have a specific gk in question, I'd be glad to give my take them but honestly I don't have an in-depth rating system like you're wanting. Maybe next time around ; ) Re: Bardsley  gt; Solo - Kind of like I wrote below, Solo really struggles with crosses. I think the opener shows some shades of that. Tough plays and good goals overall, but she doesn't help herself: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EX3xPu6-sWk First one (1:30 in video) she is just so out of control. Yes it's a deflection but that's a bad mistake. By the time the ball is headed, she's in the middle of the goal. By the time it goes through the center of the goal, she's outside the post. It's just movement for movement's sake there. Second one (4:35) she's surprised by the cross/shot for some reason. Not sure why she wasn't expecting that but someone of her ability, and size for that matter, should either get that over the bar or get it out of the area, not pop it up to only come back down in front of the goal. Again, tough plays but she needs to do better and I think it's just the typical drop that comes with age. Bardsley isn't completely sound (v. Germany, for example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNMQcjFXJ0c) but she doesn't overplay her hand as much as Solo does imo and that's why I gave her the bump.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>First off, thanks and great user name! Lost is the last tv show I've watched all the way and have had a hard time following it up. Solo is an interesting case and I think the next couple years will be very telling. Personally, I think not only will the US move on to another gk but I believe Seattle is looking to put Kopmeyer in net as soon as she's ready, which we all know that is close. I wrote a little more on Solo and Bardsley on floppylobster's comment. Lindahl was very tough for me to rate. (vs. Liverpool: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeM1-cXio2k) Shot stopping she is great but some of the movement, I'm not a huge fan. But I did have her low and should have had her higher. Good eye. In some ways, van Veenendaal is in the same boat as Solo for me (vs Chelsea: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67UNI5An_kE) It seems like she is trying to do too much. The second goal there is a little telling imo. She wildly throws her body at the ball, hoping something will work, instead of just using proper mechanics, which I'm admittedly a stickler for. Yeah Dalton is too high. Another good call. I haven't watched her a ton but she does remind me of Barnhart in the way she plays. Very reserved but clean. Great comments! Thanks a lot.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah tbh I probably need to go track down more of Bardsley. It sounds like maybe one of us knows more about Solo and the other Bardsley. Maybe not. I would have gladly shown more of Solo at the WC stage but outside of the Australia game she really didn't have to do anything! Thought it was kind of silly she won golden glove after she sat back for most of the games. Ha. Campbell is very good. Best in the college game atm. I had her at number one in the junior class at the end of last year: http://www.everybodysoccer.com/even-the-goalkeepers-like-to/2015/12/19/end-of-year-ncaa-goalkeeper-rankings-womens-2015 Thank you for all the kind comments and feedback!

    <TEXT>Hey, looks good! A couple things just to be mindful of, not trying to be too nitpicky, but since you asked... - 2:04, I think it's okay here bc of the situation but make sure you have both posts covered when setting up (before the slide). If you pause here you can see how out of line you are. Again, he's so far out it's not an issue but keep an eye on that. - 2:40, of course try to hold onto that but even if you can't, be very careful of falling backwards like that. If you can hit it to the ground (I assume the ball has movement on it) then you can catch it on the bounce. - 3:30, probably needs to go out for a throw-in - 4:20, be careful on rushing cross field passes, especially with a strong wind. No sense in trying to catch the opposition napping if the risk/reward doesn't weigh out. - 4:35, great save but I like the footwork better. I like that you read that he's going to beat you to the ball so you square up instead of just barreling through out of control. Very good. Your teammates should have thanked you for that save. If I were to be reeeal nitpicky I'd say you'd probably want the flexibility to save with the inside of your foot than the outside but it's a goal you saved so that's the bigger point. - 5:05, your body shape looks very weird but eh. Careful with the high line here. Don't want to get lobbed. - 6:30, good quick throw. Can't really see what happens immediately but like the idea and it starts a counter. - 8:05, big gamble on the challenge but you play it well and clear it out. - 9:10, nice touch but it'd be even nicer if you and your RB were on the same page for him to receive the ball. The next opportunity you get after this play, you need to remind him "Hey, get wide when I get the ball." Unless he is not very good w/the ball then that's different. - 9:25, a good example of why gks need to get set on every touch. You're still moving your feet (from the video that I can tell) when the ball is passing your head. Speed up your footwork so you can put yourself in a better position to make a save. Hell of a shot, but wouldn't say it's out of your grasp completely. - 10:00, ballsy. - 10:15, don't think it's out of the possibility for the winger to just slot it in front post instead of cross it. I know you're trying to set up for the cross but it all goes to moot if you get scored on bc you weren't covering the goal properly. - 11:05, good example of when you don't need to kill the ball. That's maybe your best pass as far as accuracy goes. Now, he actually gets put into immediately double pressure, which is something you need to recognize. So maybe not the best option but I still like the lob. - 11:20, your RB is not marked up and you need to call that out. Hard to tell exactly what happens on the save but you bat it down and out of your reach, which isn't ideal. I #8217;d say the biggest issue here is you get set too late (ball is half way to you by the time your feet get set) and your feet are extremely wide. You actually have to pull your right foot in for a ball that #8217;s hit outside of your body. Tighten up that set stance and you can break out of it better. Think you do alright on the ensuing scramble. - 12:46, careful jumping backwards to catch a ball. Not an issue here. - 13:00, don #8217;t let the wind trick you. You know it #8217;s going to blow back into you so give yourself just a split second to read it right. - 13:50, I know hindsight is 20/20 but for a bounding ball like that, I think you #8217;d be better off waiting in the box. He #8217;s likely to take a bad touch, might as well let him. If he doesn #8217;t, you play the 1v1. Here, you #8217;re risking a lot on an unpredictable ball. Tough to play. general: - thought the distribution was good overall. One thing I tell everyone is that communication is just as important as the pass. So if you're rolling out to someone but don't give them any instruction, you're leaving them out to dry. I can't tell how your communication so maybe you're great at it, idk. But ideally the gk is giving an instruction before their teammate even gets the ball, especially if the field player has his back to the field. If you don't make a command, they have to turn and read on the fly. Very tough to do consistently. And this isn't just on when you make the pass it's non-stop throughout the game. Communication isn't just for defense, you can control how the attack flows if you're able to effectively communicate it. Think of playing FIFA (video game) and just call it what you want them to do. It gives your teammates more information and if they see a better option, fine, but if not they can default to what you say, not just what they see. - you definitely have a ton of length on your punts/goal kicks. Be mindful of how the opposition is dealing with them. If they've figured you're just going to hit it as hard as you can every time, you've lost the ability to really surprise them with it. If they are dropping way off, I'd say mix it up with less power or a long throw. Also, while it may be really impressive to hit a ball that far, if y'all are only retaining 20% of them (ballpark) then it's not worth it. So watch how the opposition is reacting to you and play to y'all's strengths as well. If y'all can track down those long punts, cool, if not, you might want to change the game plan. Overall I think you definitely have some upside to your game! Would just clean up some aspects and really try to insert yourself as much as possible. Take responsibility for everything on the field. If a player turns the ball over, did you give any instruction to help out? If not, it's somewhat on you as well. All the best for the rest of the season!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Austin show / mwy update</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-05-29 18:37:18</DATE>
    <TEXT>I drove down to Austin yesterday to catch the concert but i waited too long to get a ticket. I figured i could pick up an extra ticket somewhere so i just waited outside for about two hours. Ricky (the drummer) walked out and i talked to him for a bit. I asked him about his drumming style and how much energy he brought to the stage. (For example, he drummed with his shirt over his head for a good 15-30 seconds at one point last night.) He said he kind of blacks out when he's up there and if he tries to really focus on something, he's more likely to mess up. He went inside - very nice guy - but i was still looking for a ticket. Talked to a guy named Phil who was there to see mwy. He said he talked to Aaron earlier while Aaron was taking out the trash. Apparently he told Aaron they should "******* be headlining" and I thought about all the weird interactions they must get as a band. Thin Lips sounded good from the outside. Joyce Manor and Museum Mouth sounded loud. Eventually a guy named Anthony shows up looking for a ticket too and up until this point I wasn't really bothering people going in. I was kind of worried that I was going to be told to leave, trying to buy a ticket that close to the door and just figured me standing there would imply I needed a ticket. Well sure enough asking people works a lot better than not and Anthony finds a ticket (which he lets me buy, very kind of him) within 20 minutes of being there. He gets himself a ticket about ten minutes later. Dude was gold. They opened with Magic Lantern Days then went straight into Torches, which Aaron only sang about 20% of the words. The band just kept going as Aaron is coming in and out of the song. He said after the song that he found out someone close to him had died just before the show but that he loved the songs and loved us being there (paraphrase). I recorded a couple of the songs - not great quality but you can hear him talking at the end. I'll put them up tomorrow. The show was fine. Kind of short. Maybe 8-10 songs. Kind of a weird set. I'm sure Ricky tweeted the list out. But everything went smoothly. I think Michael's mic was not turned on and I saw him repeatedly bat it trying to get the sound guy's attention at one point. Halfway through the show they brought a cake out for Greg (bass) because that was his last show with the band. Modern Baseball was up next and I caught one song then dipped out (they sounded good and the crowd was really into them, much more so than mwy). The band was hanging out afterwords and I spoke to everyone except Michael bc he looked like someone who had a huge migraine and didn't really want to talk. Not sure if that was the case but either way I left him alone. Spoke to Ricky again and asked him about inverting his drum sticks. He said it was mainly for not breaking them (i guess normal grips are more likely to?) and it gives a heavier sound. Mike (other guitarist) and Greg were at the bus. Mike was very friendly and Greg said he had a baby on the way and was trying to finish up seminary school out in Portland, which is why he's stepping aside. He didn't know how they were going to go about replacing him (said they had some options) but when I asked about mwy still continuing, he kind of gave a "we'll see" answer, which I'm sure is the truth but i was surprised to here it that optimistic. I just kind of assumed the band would split after this album. Not sure why. I should have asked them about the show in Bartlesville but honestly was kind of star struck so I was just glad to get a few questions in. Finally crossed over with Aaron and asked him if he had time for a question. (I really didn't want to bother him.) He said "walk wth me" and we went to the back side of the bus to put up a suitcase. I asked about the transition in Rainbow Signs. I get the general gist of the end of times part and the inside joke with his dad, but was very curious of why he decided to end with those two back-to-back. (I had to rephrase my question, I dont think I was very coherent the first time.) He said, and I wish I had recorded it just for accuracy's sake as Aaron always gives a very full answer, that he had written the heavier part first but essentially when he got their it didn't feel like an appropriate ending as he didn't feel like he had command on the subject. He also thought about how every other album ends so heavy handed, specifically citing Circles on the last album, and he wanted a change of pace from that. I asked if the late addition of the inside joke changed the way he viewed the album and he said that was a good question. (I've heard him make the comment to a reporter/someone a few times and internally I was fist bumping myself for hearing that.) He said he hoped the ending gave an appropriate lens for looking back on the album. Sort of a "better understanding of where you've come from once you reach the ending" sort of thing. He remarked how we can never fully understand someone else and while we may get close, there's always a disconnect and he just thought that was interesting. (I think specifically he said it made him "giggle". Not exactly sure how he tied giggling in, looking back.) I said I'd get out of his hair and said I was sorry for his loss. He said thanks but I felt that he was somewhere else mentally, which is understandable of course. I will say he still appeared to want to give me his attention and a full answer, which was very kind of him. I think I ended the convo with saying something stupid like "If you're ever in Arkansas I can help you out." I don't even know what I was trying to say. I think it confused Aaron too. Idk. I think that's it. I just wanted to share the info and some answers I had gotten along the way.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well I think Aaron/Michael will continue to make music in some form or another. They just can't seem to escape it. And Ricky said that Pale Horses is the exact kind of drumming he has always wanted to play. So I think there is still more to come, but I wouldn't be surprised if it continued to take a different direction than they originally started out as.</TEXT>

Crossing situations and free kicks are trickier to work on if you don't have the bodies to work with. Goal kicks and punts may need a refresher. Maybe hand strength?

    <TITLE>emo / common themes / ghosts</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-06-24 01:06:23</DATE>
    <TEXT>I remember watching this video on how country songs all have the same lyrics: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WySgNm8qH-I And I thought of how emo seems to incorporate ghosts a lot, both on album covers and lyrically. Off the top of my head... - Cloud District: https://clouddistrictmusic.bandcamp.com/album/almanacs - Morning Effort: https://morningeffort.bandcamp.com/album/i-heard-you-the-first-time-it-just-wasnt-funny - Sorority Noise: https://sororitynoise.bandcamp.com/album/forgettable all have ghosts on them. Some lyrics: - Brand New's Gasoline, "I swear it's like dying / to catch a ghost" - Modern Baseball's Holy Ghost "But this time my holy ghost is hovering over me" - Tiny Moving Parts' Fair Trade, "Sometimes I feel like a ghost / The one who stays quiet and floats" - Armor For Sleep's every song I didn't know if this is really common in other genres but I've heard it a lot in emo, which doesn't bother me tbh. I think it's a vivid picture that can be taken many different ways by the listener, as opposed to trucks and dirt roads. Any other notable ghost references or common themes you hear in emo?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There's so much death alluded to in the last album that i wouldn't be surprised if they focused on renewing/birth/newness for the next album (assuming there will be one). Lyrically, Aaron seems to really turn things on its head and I wouldn't be surprised if he made prequels or "part zeros" for songs. Thinking a little further, the band will have a different lineup then. I bet their sound changes more towards what we heard on the PH appendix. And there's even a decent chance Aaron will have a kid on the way then. So i could see a circling affect, like what All Circles alludes to. I did like the Angel of Death Visited Aaron's Room.

    <TEXT>Well it's definitely gotten lower over the years. I think he originally was just trying to be as loud as possible and somewhere around CFUTF he starts to blend the singing/speaking with his yells/screams, and not just be as loud as possible. Like he is trying to smooth the transition between singing and yelling. Rainbows is a good example of this at the end, as he always on the edge of going to the next level but never really does. I feel like if they had written that song a decade ago, it would have just gone too the max as soon as possible. There's probably a change in the part of the throat/diaphragm he's used over the years but I don't think I can speak to that accurately. Just a guess. You bring up a good thought though.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Thoughts on TI from someone who does not play Dota (feedback appreciated!)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-08-15 00:20:37</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hey everyone, I watched the TI for my first time and wanted to write some ideas down and get some feedback from people who have actually played the game. I #8217;ve only ever played one game of Dota in my life and while I enjoyed it, I knew that if I were to play it, I #8217;d want to play it at the best I could, which would be a huge commitment on my part. So instead, I just watch my friends play and honestly it #8217;s really enjoyable for me still. I watched maybe 20 different games this TI and have watched another 30 or so before this tourney. I #8217;m definitely more of a football (soccer)/just about any other sport kind of guy because I #8217;ve grown up with those but I find Dota incredibly fascinating. I wrote these out over the course of the tourney and would love to hear any responses. **Overall Impression** * First off, from the little I #8217;ve seen, the community seems pretty nice on reddit. Some lady lost her bag with a jersey in it and you guys helped out. And I have a friend who dotas a lot and he was willing to let me bug him with texts nonstop and try to explain stuff to me. I know there #8217;s some tension with esports v. more established ones and I would think the esports side could become very elitist but I haven #8217;t picked up that vibe. Maybe it is, idk but I haven #8217;t picked up on that and I like the idea of a community being more than just fans to the point that they #8217;re actually helping people. * As an American, I looked up every team that had another American and watched most of their games. I know someone was complaining about the NA getting too many teams in the tourney but someone else made a good point that you really want it to be an international tournament. FIFA #8217;s World Cup runs into some similar problems (NA, again, typically cited as getting too many teams in the final tournament, along with Africa and Asia) but in 2010, the WC was held in South Africa and when Ghana was the last African team in the tournament, the entire continent was behind them and they essentially inherited home field advantage. It was an electric environment then and I think it was similar to DC #8217;s run as well. Not to mention, I don #8217;t think I would have watched any of this if there were no NA teams. I even looked up each roster to find what team had americans on them and rooted for them, which was really fun finding them in a battle and being like  #8220;yeah go that guy specifically! #8221; * Honestly I did not find the game "too" complex. I actually enjoyed learning all the ins and outs. Obviously I only know 1% of it now but even still it was cool researching stuff and learning more and more, which I found somewhat addictive tbh. **Things I liked** * Maybe my favorite thing of the entire tournament was the crowd participation. You could really tell if something big had happened and not only did that help me out but it was great audio for a game that doesn #8217;t have a ton of it. It may sound easy to do as a broadcasting group but this is actually something that soccer in the US has actually struggled with, even today. It seems like the crowd is either not there or someone is constantly yelling  #8220;fuck #8221; inside your own living room. * I do like the overall narrative of the game that multiple heroes can come from different walks of life and work together for a unique goal. I know there is a lot of violence in this game so I suppose that doesn #8217;t inspire a positive morale but it feels watered down as you just reincarnate back in the base, so it feels like you were just tagged out and have to restart. * Overall I really enjoyed the commentating. I #8217;m more of a soccer guy so I really understand the challenge - more so now - of dumbing it down yet still being analytical. So yeah I didn #8217;t really understand what they were talking about 90% of the time. After the first EG-Ehome game one of them said  #8220;I #8217;ve never seen anything like this before #8221; and I was like  #8220;yeah me too. what is going on? #8221; * Related, I loved this: https://clips.twitch.tv/dota2ti/CalmPelicanBabyRage * Visually the game is a lot of fun and I was bummed that I had to watch on 720 or 540, at times, bc my internet was so awful. But when it was 1080 it was like watching a fireworks show and i loved it. * The players were usually pretty stoic (minus the big finale, obviously) and I think this worked in and out of the broadcast #8217;s favor. It was cool to see a team win a huge match and just stroll out completely chill. I think this backfired a little when they did player interviews and, several of the ones I saw, they were so reserved it came off very awkward. But things like this are really going to propel the game forward, imo: http://gfycat.com/NarrowUnsteadyDuckbillplatypus * The names of the players not being their legal name is actually kind of similar to south american cultures giving football players nicknames. Or Chad Ocho Cinco, for an American example, I suppose. * The drums in the final. Very soccer-y. Awesome. * One analyst (i think it was the bald headed guy) sounded very similar to Landon Donovan and that was cool. * I think my favorite hero was the guy who was controlling a bear or something. Idk who it was but there was this bear running around periodically in one of the group stage games and I really enjoyed it. **Things I did not like (please correct me if I #8217;m off base)** * Commentating/analysis seemed more focus on what happened instead of the strategy behind it. I would think that 1.) strategy would something more interesting to talk about instead of just recapping who killed the most or w/e and 2.) this would be a great time for dota players to learn new tactics. I really enjoyed when they went to Purge and felt like he was underused. * There were about 20 different analysts and it was weird always going to a different group of guys. * I know I #8217;m saying a lot about the commentators - which, again, overall I enjoyed - but occasionally they would go to the panel and they were waiting so long to be prompted to speak, instead of just jumping in there. So there were these awkward pauses when in reality, they all have something to say bc they #8217;re obviously knowledgable of the game. * Idk who it was but someone kept using the phrase  #8220;caught with their pants down #8221; when describing a situation * One thing soccer in the US gets hammered for is empty seats and even though it was dimly lit on the crowd, it does look a little thin when there are front row seats that are not filled. (But to be fair they were in between games so maybe they left for the bathroom or something.) * I found the idea of holding signs behind the on-floor commentators a good idea - college football has done a great job with this - but i will say some of the signs were super lame and fans should look to do better than return to the same joke each intermission. * The lamest thing by far was the crowd doing the wave. * Some commentators pants were too tight. **Ideas (are these good ideas?)** * In general, I really think Dota would thrive from reaching out to more and more demographics. It feels like they have their niche - which is good - but also limiting. So some of these ideas are based around that while others are just random thoughts I had. * Cricket has struggled with their game being too long and losing fans bc of it and - i don #8217;t know/like cricket a ton, to be fair - but they #8217;ve apparently made a T20 game that is maxed out to make it around an hour and a half. I think Dota could do something similar by either starting the game by leveling up heroes to X levels, or do something to cut the game down to 15-20 mins. Now, this would be aimed solely at getting new players into the game, not for competitive play, but essentially make a t-ball version of dota and let players work their way up to the real thing and give more appreciation for winning a full game of Dota, not just a watered down one. * Rocket League did a great job of little player bio videos that I think Dota would really benefit from. If you can drive a narrative behind the game, it makes the viewers all the more interested and brings in new crowds. DC was the underdog and all but I want to know specifically about the players. Where are they from? What #8217;s their role? Any notable failures/successes? * I have a lot of questions about which characters are more sentient than others. Are the teams #8217; creeps any more aware than the wildlife? What is roshan #8217;s deal? Is he just napping until someone attacks him? I think it #8217;d be cool if the neutrals were more empowered to make specific choices. Could you appease the monster of roshan to go attack your opponent #8217;s base? What if the neutral creep wildlife would help play defense on your base? Or what if the wildlife would communicate with each other to help themselves from dying so often? Idk I just kind of hate it there are things there that are only made to die. * I feel like the game is ripe for advanced stats. That #8217;s obviously been a huge push with baseball in the past two decades and it #8217;s bled to every other sport. Specifically, I had a hard time gauging how important anything was. I would think an overall win prediction% would be a good start. How much of a correlation is there between (whatever act in context) and winning? Poker has this whenever hands are dealt and they #8217;re always interesting to watch how people respond to the situation, even if they don #8217;t know the win% themselves. * Someone needs to sell supplies to make signs for fans next year. Poster boards, sharpies, could get a little shirt heat press machine thing. Man they would make a killing out there. Could even take commissions to make them for people. * Display analysts #8217; track record (like they do for other sports: previous super bowl winner, hall of famer, etc) * Post-game highlights (big plays, etc) with maybe a little footer that describes the play. Essentially like most sport coverage. **Things I #8217;m curious about moving forward/would like to hear feedback** * How contracts will develop within teams - so it seems that everyone is signed on for a year or even just handshake deals of  #8220;play with us until you suck #8221; (correct me if I #8217;m wrong). It #8217;s interesting to me bc professional sports started out the opposite way, by not only having a contract with a player but also owning that player #8217;s rights. It was very hard for players to leave teams without being traded, until free agency became a thing. Well Dota is starting backwards in comparison and I wonder how that #8217;ll change, or if it even will. * Where Dota will look to reach out to - obviously egames are exploding right now but what demographs are they not reaching that they #8217;d like to? How will this change the broadcast, or even game? * In other sports, there are notable eras with play style. The most notable one for me is the  #8220;dead ball #8221; era in baseball vs. today #8217;s game. And there are even smaller sects in that. (The 90s home run boom, for example.) Football/soccer has the same way with how formations shifted from being top heavy to having a standard four man defense. So with Dota being such a balanced game, I wonder how the play style will change, or if it will stay more consistent. If it stayed more consistent, would this a strength/weakness of the game? * I thought I saw the flags wave when the game was paused (correct?) If so, why? I feel like the creators are implying something about our connection with the game.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Wow a lot of good stuff here. Thank you so much. That makes sense about the crowd. I suppose most people wouldn't want to be in an arena all day watching dota, even though I did have it pulled up at work for most the day, ha. I will say MLS attendance has half the league over 19k: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Soccer_attendance Now, most of those are soccer-specific stadiums. I think LA's is the largest SSS, at 27k capacity. But I do get your point. Great dota stat sites! Thank you! I think I got the general gist of who is winning solely from watching but that does clarify a bit, ty. However, the draft is really hard for me to know on my own as far as who is better set up to win.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>emo subgenre tree</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-04-12 00:28:05</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hey r/emo, I #8217;ve been working on this emo tree for a couple weeks now and could really use some help finishing it up. You can view the PDF here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bnQrUEmV936pa1hWnnl41dZ-V_xipHsHIjbxpr5_wWY/pub?output=pdf (it #8217;s a google doc. If you #8217;re on your computer, it should DL a PDF. If you #8217;re on your phone, I think I #8217;ve got it to the point where it #8217;s readable. Just keep scrolling sown. I had some formatting issues because it #8217;s so wide but hopefully it works now. If it doesn #8217;t work, lemme know please.) So basically this is an attempt to map out all the genres within emo, along with relevant albums for each movement. I suppose the main goal is to have an educational chart to point to and say  #8220;hey this is/isn #8217;t emo because #8230; #8221; I haven #8217;t been able to find a map for emo but there are a few cool ones for metal, which seems silly that they have cool stuff and not us. Each wave is broken into early/mid/late parts of each decade and I'd like to get 3-7 albums for each part of each decade. I've thought of adding youtube/bandcamp links down the line but I think that #8217;s version 3.0. (version 1.0 was me just drawing crazy lines on a scrap piece of paper.) I #8217;ve hit a bit of a standstill with all the knowledge/info I have. Personally, I really only listen to the right side of the map so it #8217;s hard for me to distinguish what subgenre of screamo an album truly is. The internet was helpful for a good bit but lines get blurred in the genre all the time, as we know, so I had trouble trusting everything I read. --- How can you help? Great question! --- 1) Tell me everything that #8217;s wrong about it - Typos, wrong eras, misplaced albums, non-influential albums listed over more influential albums, etc. I feel like reddit is good at pointing out flaws so hopefully this will be the case here. 2) Fill in the gaps - There are a lot of spots where a certain section just says  #8220;album #8221;. Specifically, screamo after the late 00s is just full of blanks. Again, this is stuff I don #8217;t really know about and while I could go scour lastfm tags to fill in albums (I did this more than once) I figured I could get some better answers here. 3a) Adding new content - There #8217;s a lot of talk about regional scenes but that #8217;s also something I don #8217;t know a ton about. I only have DC and San Diego on there as of right now. I #8217;d love to add more if it #8217;s possible. There are some pretty obvious restrictions by using a spreadsheet so I will do what I can. If you do have an idea for a region to be added, please give me some info on it. What bands/albums (gotta be more than one or two) and how they influenced following bands. If it #8217;s just a few bands from a general area that didn #8217;t have a huge impact, then I probably won #8217;t add them. 3b) Also random other tidbits - Are there any influential non-emo albums that should be included? Non-emo albums that are commonly confused for emo? New genres? New color schemes? Delete certain regions? I wanna know. 4) General discussion on whatever - If someone has a thought or a question, I #8217;d love to learn more about the other side of the map. --- Ideally this would become a group project as well as a future resource. I have the edit privileges but will tag your name at the bottom if you help out. (Not a whole lot of fame there but it #8217;s basically having your name put under American Football so you can take solace as that. A couple of the mods already have their handles listed below as they #8217;ve been super helpful and patient with me asking a bunch of dumb questions.) TLDR: Here is a emo tree with all the subgenres. If you see something wrong or just have a cool idea, lemme know.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; I feel like also this tree doesn't portray real good how deep the san diego stuff goes or how influential it was. But that's minor tho, good stuff all round!  gt; Moved Funeral Diner under post-screamo. Thanks for that tip. I could still use a bunch more screamo/post-screamo/emoviolence albums, especially recent ones. Also on San Diego, could you be a little more specific? There's definitely some limitations doing it this way, but is there something you'd like to see added specifically? I'll drop emotrap for now. A lot of the info here is just regurgitated from what I saw someone else say. I suppose if it really takes off, we can add it later, but until then we don't really need it. Thanks for the comments!</TEXT>

But I think that'll be changing over the next decade or so. Young gks get time where they need it (USL) and then come to MLS when they're ready, or simply wash out.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well teams will typically consider experience over potential, not to mention the salary cap limits big spending. Goalkeeper is the last position for teams to spend on so that's another hurdle. I still think there was a generation of gks who needed playing time to develop (but didn't get the chance) and were thrust into starting spots when MLS expanded.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>DCU's gk coach (Zach Thornton) has actually worked a great deal with Hamid and I think we've seen that development over the last 3-4 years. I think if Hamid had gone overseas, sat for a couple years and just really worked on his craft, we'd be seeing a much different goalkeeper. It's essentially what happened with Melia and is happening with Horvath. Those gks had/are having to figure out a way to become number one, while Hamid never really had to fight for it.</TEXT>

Same thing can be said for Dan Kennedy. I wouldn't say that's the best way to form top gks BUT it does weed out quickly the gks who aren't good enough.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No worries about unpopular opinions. They're actually super helpful for this! Appreciate the feedback! I haven't seen a consistent case for post-emocore although I do think there's a noticeable change in sound over time. Not exactly sure where I would draw that line but I would think it'd be after the 90s. I think you can still hear that hardcore punk sound throughout. But I'd definitely be up for adding post-emocore, I just don't know where to put it. As for Moss Icon/Indian Summer, I think they both definitely have emocore influences. You look at a lot of these bands, it's typically some sort of combination of genres. A lot of bands influencing each other during the 80s/90s. I think what pushes MI/IS to just emo is slower typos and more dynamic changes. There are more ups/downs in their music than what'd you find from a typical emocore band. At least from my ears. But even the sidebar has MI/IS listed as emo so I think I'll stick with that for now, unless that changes. Idk quite what to do about Thursday + company so I'm glad you brought it up. I just added TTYG/DC under emo-pop, Thursday as an emo-pop influencer, and TDAG as a emo revival influencer. What do you think?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, I guess emo-pop is still fairly new with its lines being drawn. (I don't remember anyone saying "emo-pop" in 2003, but maybe I just missed it then?) For me, I don't think there's enough of a time break or change in sound in emo-pop to really warrant a "revival" but I think there's a decent case to draw a line. But again, emo pop revival is what... five years old? Probably need more time to decide what is what. As for The Front Bottoms, I could go either way about them. They say Bright Eyes and Brand New are influences... * http://www.alterthepress.com/2010/07/interview-front-bottoms.html * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPL-uCBe77o ...but they (BE/BN) carry a lot of indie sound more than original emo pillars so it's not necessarily a complete tie-in for TFB. They have more acoustic guitar sounds than electric so while they aren't going to have that exact guitar sound you find in modern emo pop, I think there are some pretty strong similarities. "Talon of the Hawk" and Modern Baseball's "You're Gonna Miss It All" have a very similar feel, for example. Ultimately, they ARE listed in the sidebar but it's very tough to tell with indie/punk bands. So it's kind of a wash for me either way.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No bother! The more comments/ideas the better! I'll go ahead and slide Remo Drive under emo pop and if anyone gets mad about it we'll go from there. Seem very influenced by emo pop bands but i know that's not the only thing that makes an album emo. I like the bubbling idea. I think if I bolded, italicized and threw it in another color (like I did with the locations) that'd probably help. Also agree about the vetting idea. Not sure how to approach that atm so I'm just gonna leave it as is for the moment. I thought about linking bandcamps into them but idk if I'm ready for that tedious work, ha.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Agree that many are holding a grudge about the Donovan thing and that the defense has been pretty thin thus far. However, many would argue that keeping a clean sheet (or even just keeping it to one goal) in this game would not take super goalkeeping. Klinsmann had a bad game for himself or any gk at this level. As for the WCQ, a traffic cone could have gotten the US into the WC with their qualifying schedule. That's not really the litmus test for the gk spot. Typically top teams bench their gks when they're not performing well enough and the US needs to figure out which gk helps the US more going forward. Are Klinsmann's errors typical of his quality? Can JTM provide something more at the position? That's the debate rn.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>1. That was a lot more work I wasn't super excited about tbh lol. Although I did consider it. 2. Every U20 champion (since 1977) has been from UEFA or CONMEBOL except one year. The U17 tournament, on the other hand, has had winners scattered through almost each confederation, with even Australia earning a second place finish for Oceania. It seems like there's a pretty big difference between the two competitions based off of results. And from a purely anecdotal POV, it seems like U17 competitions are much more chaotic than U20 ones. Long ball attacks are more likely to win out with the younger players, but start to get defended better with the 19/20 year olds, for example.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Winning GG in CONCACAF WCQ doesn't mean a whole lot tbh. He lost to Panama and beat Haiti, Mexico, El Salvador and Honduras. Only one relevant team there. Everyone was calling for Ramos to sit JK after the opener and honestly i can't think [i am the author, hi : ) ] of one thing JK is better than JM at. I might be wrong, and if I am I'll own up, but I fully expect JM to outplay JK in the long run.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah that's a good question. The national team should want as many players vying for each spot. Yes they need to figure out the starter - arguably they have with Alyssa Naeher - but relying solely on one goalkeeper (i.e. Hope Solo) is putting all the eggs in one basket. Ideally there should be multiple goalkeepers that are competing for the spot, which is what the article was aimed at.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah that's a really great point. I'd say yes and no. Compared to the ten team NWSL league, there are probably as many equally competitive teams in all of Europe. Maybe a little more. But the bigger aspect that Europe offers is playing time for a variety of levels of competition. If a player isn't good enough for Lyon (just won Champions League), for example, there are a plethora of teams/leagues below that to offer playing time. If a player wants to stay in the US, their options are either the NWSL (incredibly limited roster space) or amateur summer leagues with little meaningful competition. So for college graduates, they should be striving for the appropriate next level. If the option is to sit the bench in the NWSL (what most 22-25 year old goalkeepers will do) or go abroad, they should go abroad in most cases. The Nordic countries are a great starting point. Specifically Iceland and Norway have been very helpful for several players' careers. And then from there they should continue to reach the next level, whether in France/Germany or perhaps back to the NWSL as a starter. But the problem is players get stuck as a backup somewhere and can't get playing time to develop their game. Their development stalls despite having the opportunity to keep growing abroad. So it's less about reaching for the most elite level and more about the appropriate next level. Some players just need playing time and simply can't get it in the NWSL because they're not to that level YET but will be at some point.</TEXT>

Also maybe the Little Rock Rangers (NPSL) but idk if they post their attendances. This place says 4k but i have a hard time believing that tbh http://midfieldpress.com/2017/02/03/little-rock-rangers-draw-big-support-only-getting-started/ Someone told me once the "Mex-Ark" adult rec league (RIP) had 1000 in attendance one game. I don't think any HS games or University of Central Arkansas (only men's D1 program in state) have topped that. Good luck!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Good question. Imo Kiedrzynek has a knack for making saves look harder than they actually are. She struggles to hold shots and typically just parries them away. I think a bigger issue is her footwork, which is fairly sloppy, especially going from post-to-post. So any time she has to move to make a save, it's mostly an upper body save without much help from her feet. This also hurts her when coming out for crosses and any 1v1s that aren't hit right at her body. If you look at the goals she's conceded for PSG you can see where she struggles but I think you can still see it even in her highlights: https://youtu.be/OQQGNX_tsZQ She's definitely grown with PSG but she still has some room to grow to crack my top 50.

And I know a lot of people complain about Moreno (rightfully so) but I'm not sure the USWNT doesn't have a bigger complaint for being more devalued than MLS-play is. Brianna Scurry (literally the best gk in the world) didn't get in until her third time and just barely. I saw one voter basically say that Scurry and Milbrett shouldn't be as valued because their competition wasn't that strong, regardless of how good they were. Completely insane.

    <TEXT>It would be nice if USSF rewarded the better crowds with higher profile games, instead of trying to spread the wealth. Give the friendlies to wherever. Doesn't matter. Imo all 50 states should be able to experience one of U17 through the National Team on both mens and women's side at least once every few years but whatever. Some people may mention that if the on-field product was better, people would turn out. Blah blah blah. If there are cities with notable good crowds, which there are, reward them but let the rest of the country have chances as well. Basically what I'm trying to say is we need pro/rel for American fan bases.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So the main standard for writers is what they're oppressed to write about? Not saying it should be illegal for them to write on certain issues, just saying there are more important topics than others.

    <TEXT>Aaron spoke about the line in an interview http://observer.com/2016/05/words-are-futile-devices-mewithoutyous-aaron-weiss-the-limits-of-language/ Yes, absolutely, I #8217;m thinking of the context in which we #8217;re being bombarded by ISIS imagery. I #8217;m also thinking of the fear-mongering mass media, which can be used to justify bigotry and the sentiments of the Republican presidential candidate, who issues sweeping condemnations of all Muslim people. It can also be used to justify war: killing others and having Americans be killed. ISIS is the current popular boogeyman. I reference them in a self-identifying way only in a context in which I #8217;m expecting nobody in our audience is sympathetic with ISIS. If we were a band in Iraq or Syria, and a good portion of our listeners were faced with this question of whether to join ranks with ISIS and commit atrocities, there #8217;s no way I #8217;d be endorsing them. Identifying with the ISIS flag design isn #8217;t in any way an endorsement of ISIS, but it is a way of identifying myself with a terrorist organization, which is frankly something I thought would raise more questions than it has. I appreciate you asking. Most people haven #8217;t brought that up, and I #8217;ve wondered, like,  #8220;Aren #8217;t you curious about that? #8221; I wondered if I #8217;d end up on an FBI watch list for saying something like that. There #8217;s a distinction between the ISIS line and the places where I sing in Arabic or reference the Quran. ISIS claims Islam and uses the Quran to justify much of what they do, but, when I sing in Arabic, I #8217;m singing heart-felt prayers or simple acts of praise to Allah. Those lines are not in any way an endorsement of Islam at large, let alone any fringe, violent, extremist sect like ISIS. With the ISIS line, I wanted to dismantle or challenge some of the fear-mongering that I #8217;ve sensed. The line is also simply an expression of my fondness for their flag design. It #8217;s powerful and strangely childish, yet menacing and iconic.</TEXT>

Before Cap'n Jazz they were in a band with the lesser known brothers, Jackie, Tito, Marlon, and Jermaine but Michael was the clear star of the group. Jermaine had a short lived but hit television shot with long time friend Bret McKenzie but both went on to do separate things after a few seasons. And then there are the cousins John, Paul, George and Ringo, which were incredibly talented but just somehow missed the boat and never received any amount of substantial radio time.

    <TEXT>Your best bets are teams that are actually competing for a national championship, not just a tourney birth. One route soccer is effective at this level to a point, but it's near impossible to win a championship with. When all your attempts on goal come from crosses, you're going to fall short sooner or later. Haven't watched much this year of these teams but I'd start with UNC, Penn State, Notre Dame, Florida, UCLA and Stanford.</TEXT>

There are 15-20 games in the fall, another 5 or so in the spring, and if they wish to play PDL/NPSL they can get another 14 in the summer. So that's 34-39 games in a year. The bigger problems are 1) the quality of play and 2) the structure of the fall. Too many teams playing route one soccer, and there's not really incentive for teams not to. Unfortunately it works at the college level and with no youth compensation, collegiate teams have to be physically fit first, technically sound second. Also the fall has too many games in a short amount of time. Players can't recover quick enough and, again, teams that succeed at smashing it down the field over and over get rewarded when their opposition is exhausted. There are a number of really sound programs in NCAA, PDL, and NPSL, but the vast majority are not. Players *can* go to a top collegiate program and spend their summer with an MLS-tied PDL team, but they have to do it right or else they'll end up playing kickball for four years Also on 1C, MLS is already doing this. But the rest of it sounds good, especially the coaching licensing. That definitely needs to change.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah that's a really good question. Imo it's just one of the many things. Pay-to-play annexes low income players from an early age. And since college is the way it is, colleges scout physically big players. So top clubs coach players to get scholarships, because how are those parents going to get their money back from all those years in club? Scholarships. MLS/USL scouts really only look at D1 prestige. For however good outside programs are, it's incredibly tough to get to the pro level if you don't go to a top D1 school or are an academy player. It's kind of assumed if you were good enough you would have gone to a D1 school from the get-go. Coaching education is another big issue. It's $20k to get an A license, assuming you don't fail any of the tests. Not that their coaching courses are really that great to begin with. I took a USSF course and got docked points because I didn't identify the goalkeeper in a formation. So instead of saying 4-4-2, I was supposed to say 1-4-4-2 lol So yeah. Lots of issues.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Some really good points in there. Definitely agree about the academies mining talent. That has clearly increased. However U17 success has such a low correlation to 1) future national team success (i.e Nigeria's U17s) and 2) the landscape for the entire country. Pay-to-play complaints are directed towards the players who aren't in the fold. All the U17 players are in the fold, clearly. But what about the outsiders? The U17s don't represent them as far as developmental goes. I agree about us dominating them but far be it from us to watch 1-4 games of these kids' career and declare them as proven fact for success of the entire nation's youth program. Are these U17s better than past ones? It definitely looks that way. But it's hard to extrapolate more than that because of so many other factors.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Typically teams pay training compensation (TC) and solidarity payments (SD) to the youth clubs that helped develop the transferred player. It's a really wonderful system that incentivizes youth clubs to develop players to their potential so they will get a slice of the transfer fee. The bigger the transfer fee, the more $$ the youth club(s) get. There's a little bit of math and specific rules to it but that's the gist. MLS told Stoke "hey don't worry about the TC. Just give us that money instead" because TC/SD don't exist in the US. Not exactly new news but it's not ideal for youth clubs all the same. One of DeAndre Yedlin's old clubs is actually in a long legal battle over this because they want that money that MLS took.</TEXT>

Poor management for much of it but I've never regretted rooting for the Rangers. We'll never be a "lovable loser" team like the Cubs simply because we're in the DFW but honestly I've thought the Cubs' mantra was pretty lame. Losing should sting. There's nothing glamorous about it. Spinning it otherwise is dumb. Thankful for what the Rangers have brought me in the past and looking forward to 2018 : )</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Maybe the highlight of the issue was Vulko and Elder Null. Stuff like this really opens up the universe just a little more. A really simple but magical insight to what Atlantis has to offer. And then I really liked Murk and Krush's interaction. The loyalty to his true king was a great finish, but any time two unlikely characters cross paths, they both gain depth. So that was a fun run in, even if it was short lived. Felt the Syra bit was a little thin. It's always easy to say someone has guilt over a death, but when it's in conversation and we don't get to see it, it doesn't carry that much weight. Murk is a good example of someone who contributed to "killing" his king so his response to salvage the issue is much more stirring than Garth's. But there's only so much you can do in 20+ pages. Overall I really liked it! Lots of moving pieces with momentum now, not just Aquaman punching the bad guy or whatever. 8.5/10 for me : )</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah that's a good question. I really like Bersano's solution-oriented approach. It's a mindset more focused on not getting beat as opposed to technical proficiency. So it'll look a little more scrappy than clean (think Melia  gt; MacMath). With young gks in MLS, it's easy to say "oh they're getting starts. They must be really good." (Not saying you are, just in general.) When the league has a history of throwing young gks in the deep end only to see them not make it. Bingham, once a promising young gk, is not getting replaced by an even younger gk. The same thing could very well happen to Tarbell.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Blake is extremely hard to rate for me. On one hand, amazing saves left and right. On the other hand, MLS gks who are better at sprawling in the box than pure shot stopping actually do better. This includes 1v1s, crossing situations, loose balls in the box, etc. So I think Blake very well could put himself into that top ten group, but I'm hesitate to commit to that until he cleans up the rest of his game.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Johnson's biggest problem for me is consistency. Just about every gk in MLS has had one really good season, and Johnson just had his first. Never performed well with Chicago for an entire season and (ask Fire fans) arguably got worse in his later years. NY seemed to provide a transformation for him, which is awesome, but I'm not expecting a 33 year old gk (by 2022) who has struggled with consistency to really be vying for a higher spot. But always happy to be wrong! Hope he shows me up.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah that's a tough one. Great question. So for any 17 year old, it's tough to say anything of their future. Really at 19/20, I think that's our first true glimpse of their talent. Now obviously dos Santos is on there but I think he's got something special going on with Benfica. Love the way he moves in the box and his ceiling can be pretty high because of it. As for Garces, the WC was a bit of a wash for me. Some really fantastic saves but the awkward, scrambling situations left me wanting more. Can he make the top 90 saves? Absolutely. Is he able to shut down loose balls or 1v1s with decisive decision making? Personally I haven't see it yet. Plenty of time for him to grow and if he proves me wrong, awesome. The more good gks we have the better. But I'm holding out until I see a little more from Garces, who will realistically be competing for the 2026 spot anyways.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well the US has had guys on GC rosters - and even receive PT in the tournament - that were never really featured in the national team program afterwords. So there's some precedence there. I think if you asked FCD fans, for the most part there, Gonzalez's play was a little underwhelming for where he should be at this stage in his career. Yes, still young, but a number of the goals he gave up were below his quality. Similar to Yarbough, too many ups and downs with his game. Still gas in his tank, but not sold on him being a top contender. But in 2018 there may be some more strides in his game so we'll see.</TEXT>

But the money has definitely played into it as well, I agree there. By the 2022 WC, Bingham will be 32 pushing 33, on the down slope of his career.

    <TEXT>Good question! Really love reading music history on the sub. Post-hardcore came before emo by a few years, but not by much. Your friend is correct there. Now, I'm not a big fan of the "every subgenre band is also considered in the parent genre" train of logic. It makes sense on paper but eventually you can get so far removed from the original sound that there is nothing left connecting the starting point to the modern subsubsubgenre. I'm not sure where the exact line is for where a genre is influenced by another vs. being a subgenre. Personally emo seems noticeably different to post-hardcore where it isn't quite in the same vein, but you can hear similarities. Although I'm sure people unexperienced with both genres would think they're the same sound.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>37-38 is very old for a goalkeeper. Typically only elite goalkeepers continue to play at that age. From my count, average age for an MLS gk is 27.1 for 73 gks. 66 are under 33 and just 7 are 33 or older. And 4 of those 7 are starters. Goalkeepers definitely *can* play at late into their 30s, but it's typically the exception to the rule. Also don #8217;t think Kronholm has ever shown any interest in playing for the US. Not sure why he #8217;s listed so highly.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well you can also play a 442 with outside mids but there are a number of ways to play it. I guess I #8217;m confused at his point. A 4132 is not suited to get a tie? Compared to what, a 451? So basically just one more holding midfielder would have gotten us a tie? When you look at the two goals, i don #8217;t think an extra CDM would have had anything to do with them.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well there #8217;s going to be space somewhere on the field. If it #8217;s a 433/4231, the space is outside. If we push players wide, the inside is thin. And both goals came from the wings (cross on the OG, second goal was a shot from a swinging ball) anyways. So a 433/4231 wouldn #8217;t really address that. Bradley had a lot on his hands but if we slid players inside, T amp;T would just continue to run the flanks. Brian McBride pointed out the lack of urgency from the team and I think that was 100% accurate. It doesn #8217;t really matter what formation you play if your players aren #8217;t ready to go. And then there #8217;s the larger issue of just not getting results through the Hex, where we played tons of different formations. For me, it #8217;s incredibly misleading to say  #8220;well we didn #8217;t get the results we needed - over the course of ten games - because our midfield was lined up slightly different. #8221; And i get that Cameron is burned, as he should be, but a formation change/Cameron not playing isn #8217;t the reason why we missed the WC. It #8217;s because our players weren #8217;t good enough. Formation wouldn #8217;t change that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well we had six guys behind the ball when they sent the cross in : / And I agree, I think Cameron would have been a better choice but I think that #8217;s just hindsight on our part. He didn #8217;t have a great game against Costa Rica a month earlier and Gonzalez was coming off a decent game against Panama. So the starting backline made sense to me. I don #8217;t think Cameron is really doing himself any favors with the tweet. First off, it #8217;s not really that great of a burn because it doesn #8217;t add up. And secondly it comes off petty to say  #8220;well if i had my way things would have been different! #8221; The USMNT (and Cameron) had plenty of opportunities to salvage points through the Hex and they didn #8217;t do it. Taking a potshot at one formation decision comes off as empty as the USMNT #8217;s performances.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>But we weren #8217;t beat on counters. On the own goal we had six people behind the ball. The other was a shot from Trinidad while the goal was in Tobago. And we were down 17 minutes into the game so we have to go offensive anyways. I don #8217;t love how we set up in general but it #8217;s such a small piece to why we didn #8217;t qualify. All these people are stepping up to become the new USSF president not because we picked one bad formation, but because there #8217;s something systemic that #8217;s causing these results. Two very different coaches with different approaches got the same results. Cameron complaining about formations is misleading because there #8217;s so much more going on.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2017-11-14 01:28:32</DATE>
    <TEXT>So we all know that Kyle has also been married to Miley Cyrus: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vID0oH_2x9Q We were informed that he raised a child and also died soon after. This all occurred after Kyle and Miley's failed sex tape attempt back in October 2013. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEqStuivoio Now in the recent documentary about his relationship with Miley, Kyle claims that Miley is probably a "time lord... or, a time master?" when I believe it is actually Kyle Mooney who is the time lord. I believe this because of the recent news that Kyle and Leslie have raised a child together. 1:10 here: https://youtu.be/zB-rEtQbbYo?t=1m10s Now while we all believe that Miley Cyrus is the time lord, I think it is actually Kyle who is indirectly (or perhaps, intentionally) bending time and space. He has now raised two children in less than the normal amount of time it takes to raise children, as well as dying, which I think a lot of people forget about.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Wow this is a really obscure and a great find. So there #8217;s a line early on in the song,  #8220;Feel again the Dr. Bronner sermon on the soap jar #8221; Emanuel Bronner is best known for his  #8220;Dr. Bronner #8217;s castile soap #8221; which contained moral and religious content all over the package label in very condensed print. (I don #8217;t believe he was an actual doctor and there #8217;s a heart-wrenching story of him and his father on the wiki for those that want to feel extremely sad.) His wiki: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emanuel_Bronner Picture of the label: https://www.incimages.com/uploaded_files/image/1940x900/feature-72-dr-bronners-label-pan_15165.jpg Aaron #8217;s line is directed at himself, as the mwY liner notes were (somewhat) jam packed into the booklet and containing religious/moral themes. The meme here is a lady listing off a number of things that the soap can do, which (from my understanding) the words on the label aren #8217;t detailing the soap #8217;s use but I think the joke still lands.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It comes off a little underhanded if they #8217;re campaigning for her but not necessarily unethical. It #8217;s not a good look if Gulati/Garber are going around and saying  #8220;hey vote for X candidate #8221; because it #8217;s the candidate #8217;s job to win over voters. If Carter can #8217;t convince voters herself, it #8216;s shady that Gulati/Garber are saying  #8220;hey just trust us. #8221; So it hurts Carter in that regard by making her platform a little thin, especially when you #8217;re outside looking in (opposing candidates, voters, the public, etc) And in general i think there #8217;s a bit of distrust that there aren #8217;t backroom meetings going on, which again, not necessarily unethical, but there seems to be a small wedge coming in to the soccer base.</TEXT>

If people want Gulati out, why should we expect people to be comfortable with his chosen successor? On top of that, both have sent mixed messages to the public about their roles in all of this. And say whatever you want about other elections but we #8217;re in unfamiliar territory here. It #8217;s not a 1:1 comparison with every other election in other environments.

They aren #8217;t popular right now and they #8217;ve sent mixed messages to the public about their hand in this. I know Trump has polarized all of us but this is a clear PR misstep. If they came out more transparent about what they were doing, that #8217;d help. But that still doesn #8217;t change the fact that - right or wrong - a number of people are pointing fingers at them for the WC failure. It #8217;s a complicated issue.

All I #8217;m saying is it #8217;s a little underhanded by Gulati to be responsible for the worst USMNT campaign in history yet try to tell people who they should pick as his replacement. On top of that, he #8217;s lying about what he #8217;s doing. At every turn he loses his credibility. Gulati is certainly welcome to do so - it #8217;s not really an ethical or not situation - but it #8217;s a dumb move and it doesn #8217;t make sense for people to side with him.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Caliguri and Wynalda have been in support. IIRC Gans and Winograd have spoken for pro/rel as possibility but open to other forms instead of the typical 3 up/3 down. Specifically I remember Winograd saying he would be interested in essentially locking all MLS teams in MLS, but have three lower league teams promoted. At the end of the season, if any of those three are in the bottom three, they #8217;re out/replaced, if not they stay/no new addition. But both sounded like (from the gotsoccer forum) they #8217;re interested but the timing may not be right. Have not heard from the others, which I assume means they #8217;re not interested in implementing it.</TEXT>

People want to talk about the MLS #8217;s calendar setup but the NWSL still has a long ways to go. I really like how level-headed he is, he #8217;s just not so great with the media side unfortunately. Idk why he released this Friday 7pm ET. Lol come on man.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I believe Herrera #8217;s point is that playing for two months after a four month vacation is tougher for players to find their stride as opposed to playing for playing Sept-Nov, off for two months, then hopping back into it as the winter warms up, where you still have another two months before a summer tournament. Idk if y #8217;all watch the CCL but there #8217;s a reason why MLS teams look very sluggish and why they don #8217;t perform well in the knockout stages. I agree there #8217;s no great solution - and I #8217;m not insanely in favor of switching the calendar - but it #8217;s not an impossible plan to switch the calendar and Herrera is making a good point on how it isn #8217;t helping his players.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Y #8217;all didn #8217;t get an entirely new team after June. Everyone continued to find more of a rhythm, whether that included starters playing better or role players working their way into a larger role with the team. It #8217;s not like y #8217;all dropped all 11 starters after June and brought in 11 gamechangers. MLS runs March-November out of fear for the winter weather, not because they think it #8217;s better for the players. No league is thinking about switching to MLS #8217;s schedule for a reason. So to say players are at their peak in June, that #8217;s not based on anything. More games under a player #8217;s belt is universally accepted as better for a player #8217;s development, both in the short and long term.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>emo tree 2018 update</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-01-01 21:24:51</DATE>
    <TEXT>hello friends, i'm trying to do my end-of-year-update on the emo tree. A lot of help went into it so far, to which I am very thankful for because I only know so much : ) To those who missed the original post, the emo tree is intended to be a guide for people to see how the various subgenres of emo have grown and where they derive from. It's not a complete source of every emo album, just a highlight of all the different kinds. So here's what we have so far: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRo7nEKYJyt5INykxNsmIbnO2l1Xm8SxNCbJnbsWuwRTPkqO_M5ziF95oE1rJroAouZKQ6zlATcgPvE/pub?output=pdf (if you're on your phone, you'll probably have to scroll down to where the tree is split in two because its so wide. the left side of the tree is more screamo/metal while the right side is more indie/punk/pop. if you're on a compy, it'll DL a PDF) The only real big update is that I knixed weed pop as a genre as that was more of a culture than a specific sound. it's why spock rock and whitebelt are not included as well. There are some new albums on there but those are the only things I can think of. what I need help with: 1. any killer 2017 releases that MUST be on the tree? these releases must have some influential element to them and not just be your favorite underground album you randomly found on bandcamp. 2. i'm still pretty thin on the left part of the tree. Specifically more of the modern post-screamo, blackened screamo, skramgaze, and sass sections. Any suggestions would be gladly appreciated 3. br~nd n~w is currently listed on the tree twice. Once for Deja (emo-pop) and once for TDAG (influential indie album). This is intended to be a community project so I don't mind taking them off but obviously they had a strong impact on the scene so from a historical POV, i didn't know if they warranted inclusion still. I took off j~nk because their following/legacy is basically zero now but BN is a different case. 4. lastly, any general typos, large omissions, misplacements, etc, hmu. I don't think we're ready to include any new genres on the tree just yet, but I for one am ready to welcome our new overlords of party emo.</TEXT>

I think we jumped the gun with weed pop and want to wait on things to settle a little bit. Perhaps after we have a stronger 2018 on party emo we can include them then?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That #8217;s starting to be the trend but in 2013 it didn #8217;t really happen a whole lot. IIRC it was the first year for affiliates and teams only invested slightly, whether by choice or because they didnt have enough players to spread out.

    <TEXT>I think the whole point is to guarantee stable clubs as a part of pro/rel. I #8217;m sure they would offer waivers if another Chattanooga popped up. The whole point of pro/rel is inclusion so they would certainly find a way to work it out.

Also again, I #8217;m sure if a rogue team popped up with thousands of fans, they would find a way to integrate the team. This is just a plan to kick off pro/rel, not exclude any future entities, which hasn #8217;t been discussed yet. I think it #8217;s safe to say EW/KM aren #8217;t saying teams after 2024 are eternally banned from participating in the pyramid.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>To some extent, yeah. I #8216;d say most of the sub would theoretically have liked for both MLS and NASL to be successful leagues but the reality is NASL didn #8217;t so themselves a lot of favors. Regardless of whatever dreams NASL had, they were never a serious competitor of MLS. If they had just continued slowly building and realized that, for a large part, riding MLS #8217;s success would have helped their league grow as well then who knows where their league could have gone. Maybe they could have challenged MLS in the long run. But they shot for the moon way too early and it didnt work out.

    <TEXT>Yeah I think the commentators are forgetting - or not knowing - that OWL fans aren #8217;t interested in their opinions or ability to be right, they want to hear an interesting story. Narrative is why any fan returns to any sport. The storylines, the personalities, the cinderella stories. It #8217;s why everyone isn #8217;t automatically a fan of the best team (in any sport). I will say it #8217;s nice that the main complaint of an egame is the commentator bias. The general presentation has come a long way from where it was and I #8217;m sure it #8217;ll continue to improve. But this is a fair complaint.</TEXT>

I #8217;ve heard the phrase  #8220;just as we expected #8221; more than i can count.

    <TEXT>Yeah these are all solids points here. The time to collapse was 15 years ago. At  #8220;best #8221;, the only thing I can see that would really hurt the league is a strike at the next CBA. I do think American players are starting to realize they didn #8217;t get their money #8217;s worth last time and with all the injection of allocated money, they #8217;re getting less and less of the pie.

    <TEXT>I really like the idea of these posts so first I will upvote you But the idea of Kenneth Kronholm sliding to us is a bit ridiculous. First off, he #8217;s not *that* good that we need chase him down. Secondly, he #8217;s too old. And third, the window to get him to switch was five years ago. He would have done it by now if he could. Lord knows we weren #8217;t short on gks over the last 5 years. The odds of him coming to the US now are less than 1%. Instead you could replace him (or add to the next post) with Brandon Austin, currently playing at Tottenham. English-American academy kid. Could be big.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>They've actually done a wonderful job of making it simple for newbies but also keeping it in-depth, that's not really my complaint. There's no point telling the audience who is "supposed" to win. It doesn't educate or rope in new viewers, and experienced watchers don't get anything out of it either. They're all capable of providing good insights, it's just weird that predictions are such a centerpiece for their conversations.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That is true, but it #8217;s still the same issue there. After the Super Bowl no one thought  #8220;oh wow that commentator was correct! #8221; I can #8217;t even remember people #8217;s predictions. But a big narrative going into the game was Brady #8217;s performance, which ended up being a big factor. Really the only person #8217;s predictions in sports that are cares about are Lee Corso #8217;s because he puts on the giant head-ware, not because he is typically right or wrong.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I like their approach in balancing simplicity and in-depth material. I wouldn't change anything in that regard. And the hyping is good too. I think the crowd actually responds really well to the current broadcasting team. But the narrative of "The underdogs won! Everyone said they couldn't do it, but they did!" is (1) largely driven by themselves and (2) can be done without them predicting matches. You can talk about why a team is an underdog, or how a team will have to play to overcome "goliath" without saying "...and I think this team will win." It adds nothing yet they even needlessly revise predictions at the break. Just drive a good narrative and the rest will take care of itself.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think you are missing Cameron #8217;s point. Klinsmann was all about competitiveness, which is only highlighted by how quick someone was to lose their starting spot. Specifically looking at our last player pool, we were thin on defenders but had an abundance of midfielders, especially CDMs. So, true to Klinsmann #8217;s nature, he slid a CDM back to keep talent in the midfield and try to put a bandaid on the backline. It didn #8217;t work. Orozco wasn #8217;t great either. But at some point or another so was every other defender. Even  #8220;Klinsmann #8217;s guys #8221; were at fault more than once. No revisionist history. Like you said, lots of blame to go around. But Klinsmann switching personnel had a point to it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well I think it #8217;s safe to say that MLS #8217;s priorities are centered more on making money than finding true competition/development. And while I am in favor of Euro-izing the league, the league continues to grow. Could it be more effective and better? That #8217;s a different argument. But we have seen many improvements from 20 years ago, but also the last 5-10. So it may have its priorities out of line but it is interested - to some degree - in improvement. Here #8217;s a better question, and one that could actually bolster your argument: what is the ceiling for MLS #8217;s current game plan? We know they #8217;re growing, that #8217;s not really in dispute. But where will they top out and why? If you are really wanting to sell pro/rel and everything that comes along with it, that #8217;s a better angle than  #8220;mls is trash boo #8221;.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A main point to the article is that there is no incentive for teams to develop well-rounded players. High schools will win more games playing route one soccer. Clubs are trying to land their players scholarships for colleges, which are playing 20+ games in 3 months. So it #8217;s no surprise that colleges are so focused on being more physical than their opponents, especially when you are playing your final in the winter. No one is going to try to possess the ball on snow. They #8217;re going to offer scholarships to athletes over technical players more often than not. College coaches are (understandably) more focused on keeping their jobs more than getting players into MLS so they don #8217;t have enough incentive either. MLS academies are setup to combat all this but we all know how difficult it is for a U23 player to get time in the league. So idk how viable the numbers are from the article - not saying they aren #8217;t - but they #8217;re definitely right in trying to incentivize better player development. Even if clubs had an unlimited surplus, teams would still need reason to develop their players in a different way than they currently are.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Oh man this is awesome. Haha. Great idea As a Fuel fan i will add that Dallas always gels with Mickie but not the DPS. So personally i #8217;d bump Mickie up to an 85 and drop Effect/Taimou #8217;s  #8220;form #8221; by -1 or -2 but keep their overall rating. (I realize you aren #8217;t doing form but just wanted to stay true to FIFA ratings.) Very good work!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah Orisa is not his strong suit. Fwiw he has a good Roadhog and while not as technically proficient as Taimou, he is (imo) Dallas #8217; best team player and i think it shows in both dva/hog. Never gets picked or separated from the group. Does a good job with spacing and crowd control. And you can tell how much easier it is for his teammates to play with him than Taimou, who is so confident (understandably so) he kinda just does what he wants.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah I #8217;m mostly agreeing with you. It seems like a little over the top to cry wolf after ratings have dropped consecutively since January 2nd, but are actually as high as the start of August. It sounds worse than it actually is https://www.cagesideseats.com/wwe/2018/2/23/17044518/wwe-smackdown-live-ratings-feb-20-2018-numbers-up-styles-flair The main problems I #8217;ve read about, which are listed above, are repetitive shows. I think people are ready for Nakamura to take off. The tag teams divisions feel a little stale to me, although there is clearly talent, and the women #8217;s division feels very hit or miss. But Roode is a bright spot, with of course AJ. And i don #8217;t think Jinder is getting enough credit right now tbh But I think you and I would agree in that even if the storylines are a little thin the talent is engaging enough.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Really disappointing to read about (again). People talk about the American player not being good enough for minutes in MLS anymore but it #8217;s another example of MLS not holding up their end of the development process. It #8217;s extremely hard for a non-HG underclassman to simply enter the league. Then when they #8217;re in, teams have so much power and control with a player #8217;s rights (even when their contract runs out) they can easily get stuck between a rock and a hard place. I assume the next CBA will move the needle a little more but it #8217;d be nice if the league was pro-active on issues instead of waiting for a potential strike to respond to problems.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It feels like Effect is having a hard time gelling with the rest of the squad. Every game I #8217;ve caught it seems like the strategy is to just let Effect worry about himself and the rest of the team fights 5v6. At this level, just harassing the enemy #8217;s backline with a tracer really isn #8217;t enough (which was why I was looking forward to more XQC + Effect but oh well on that). They need to coordinate around Effect #8217;s ground play more. I #8217;m not sure if the problem is lack of communication on Effect #8217;s part or if the team think he doesn #8217;t need help (looking at you KyKy) but it #8217;s not working. The dps can #8217;t get picks quick enough with this strat and we don #8217;t have strong enough tank play to sustain opponents, so we crumble faster just about every time.</TEXT>

For me, his issues are stemming from a systemic problem, not his game play specifically.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think part of the issue when comparing egame coaches to more traditional coaches is that the former has a culture of  #8220;calling it as they see it #8221;, so to say. A similar thing happens in soccer/football. American coaches/journalists sugar coat a lot while European (most notably English) coaches/journalists will be hypercritical at the drop of the hat. Just kind how people speak about their respective games. There are a number of times in both interviews that Kyky actually steers away from naming players by name and just alludes to poor behavior, which isn #8217;t really a surprise to anyone that #8217;s followed the team. The xqc bit is a good example of him being honest but also mentioning how they all still like the kid as a person. Not saying kyky has a flawless record but i do think outside looking in is a tough way to understand his comments with the appropriate context.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Understandably so. I suppose this is something that comes with age, as most coaches who take the blame are older but OWL coaches are still in their 20s. Their focus is on being right, not what #8217;s best for the team, i would wager. I #8217;m curious what egame coaches will be/act like in 10-20 years.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It #8217;s funny to me that fans want this info and then when it comes out they say they shouldn #8217;t have leaked it. And then commenters are counseling akm on what he should do next lol. That #8217;s a lot of entitlement there. These kids are really young. I think everyone is forgetting that. When you have a bunch of college aged kids on one of the worst teams (by record), it #8217;s not realistic for them to be professional every time. It #8217;s a growing process for these kids.</TEXT>

At the very least it is comforting to see Rascal go out of his way to make sure his relationship with akm is good. That #8217;s a big plus. Kyky is in an awkward spot right now. Oof.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Lack of working cohesively. This extends to team comps, strats, and comms but all track back being more of a  #8220;business #8221; environment and less of a  #8220;family #8221; one, so to speak. If we can see they have poor tank play or whatever, they most definitely can as well. So gameplay is something they #8217;re well aware of but (until last week) we haven #8217;t seen any real improvement in. It #8217;s much deeper than executing at this level, which i think kyky, effect, akm and rascal #8217;s comments all allude to.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Using word changes over time is tricky because there is a dictionary to reference and language is something used so widely. Very few people aren #8217;t using language. If I introduce you to a new word, context clues can get you in the right ballpark to its meaning. When people who arent familiar with emo are presented with a true and false example of its music or cultural aesthetics, they won #8217;t be able to make as strong of conclusion. This is kinda why every band is called  #8220;emo #8221; by someone at some point, simply because there is a strain in the singer #8217;s voice. With this specific genre v subculture question, I think a better parallel is national stereotypes. For example, Americans tend to view all Australians as some derivative of Steve Irwin. Even though a number of people are wrong, does having so many people agreeing on a specific view carry any weight? Music is tough to narrow down, especially now with so much of it bleeding over into a hundred other genres. Emo, like most things, is best to be defined by those inside rather than out. Except for extreme cases, a sports fan can #8217;t really tell an athlete they #8217;re not a good teammate, but the teammates can. A stranger can #8217;t say a student doesn #8217;t do well in class, but their classmates can. Etc etc. It can come off elitist, sure, but there #8217;s not a lot of benefit to giving a platform to people who are uninformed. You would essentially be at the will of whatever the new popular opinion would be. The only way the goth mall look would be accepted as emo would be for those in the scene to agree on it, which is kinda the whole point. Those inside are going to offer a more accurate litmus test, even if the public is off-base.</TEXT>

I suppose the OP #8217;s question/response would be, does so many people agreeing affect where the compass is pointing? Is emo re-defined by the public #8217;s view?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hmm. Interesting analysis. Can #8217;t say the theory is misguided, although I think the landscape is changing. Iirc the 1988-1992 age range stayed stateside while the 93 #8217;s and younger pursued Europe more aggressively, and I think we #8217;re starting to see the dividends from that. Additionally the USL #8217;s expansion will help be a much needed stopgap for many players, whether college graduates or young players skipping college although. That didn #8217;t really exist 5-10 years ago, at least to the level it is now. So things aren #8217;t stagnating completely. Development looks different now than 10 years ago. I guess the question now is where is the ceiling for our current model? Which i don #8217;t have a good answer to.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Very good! I would say I really enjoyed your take on *why* parts of the song were good (or why you really enjoyed them) much more than the *what*. For readers, either we're already familiar with the song/album or completely clueless, so describing the what will come off a little more thin either way. But the why gives an in-depth look, often from another angle, and that was really insightful. But I enjoyed it overall : ) I liked how you pulled out specific lines instead of going over EVERY word from the song. Keep it up!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The thing about quad dps is that you have to be REALLY good at 1v1 battles. If you dive with all dps you #8217;ll get shredded. And at this level, you can #8217;t consistently expect to win 1v1 battles to really overtake your opponent. Either they #8217;ll eventually win a duel or they #8217;ll collapse to their team. I think if Dallas focused more on playing their best characters and not shoehorning classic 2-2-2 comps, they #8217;d be better off. They #8217;ve had SOME success with trip tank and I actually like it under certain situations. So i could see that working.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If the issue with having players of varying physical developments on a team is that the coaches don #8217;t know how to handle the undersized players, then it is the coaches that need to get better, not reshuffling the deck. I don #8217;t think this is a terrible initiative but it #8217;s certainly misguided. Even putting the coaching problem aside, biobanding offers late bloomers easier competition on the front end while early bloomers will be playing with the same level of competition on the back end. For example, if a 15 year old is an early bloomer and ends up playing with the 99 percentile of players, they #8217;ll continue to play with those same sizes players for the next three years. As the 15 year old develops, their competition plateaus. And the late bloomer gets an easier competition all along the way.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The early bloomers are found out because their coaches don #8217;t adequately prepare them for the next level. That #8217;s the issue, not that they are stronger/faster. This is a tool to reorganize the players. The coaches still have to teach them. If they were struggling to teach undersized players adequately, then they are missing crucial parts to being an educator. Plus there are still going to be physically superior players at any level, which those coaches will likely still gravitate towards. Simply regrouping them doesn #8217;t mean everyone is at the same level. Plus even collegiate players are deemed too small. This is not an isolated issue in the youth. There are coaches in all areas that don #8217;t know how to teach players that aren #8217;t the physically elite. D1 coaches are even more likely to overlook late bloomers now. Why recruit a freshman/sophomore when he/she is playing with their peers, as opposed to one who is playing at the oldest maturity bracket?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Right and do you think Cahill and company would have developed better if they played against weaker competition? Even at the professional level, they are outsized. That never changes, but they figured out how to beat the bigger players/better, not just play with their own level. The whole initiative is centered around removing the variable of physical development by putting them into similar groups but in reality they are over emphasizing just one area of soccer. What about tactical development? Technical development? Mental maturity? It #8217;s just another example of American soccer focusing too much on the physical aspect of the game and not much else.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well depends what you #8217;re looking for, I suppose. I have always appreciated the  #8220;now #8221; mindset Arkansans have. Of the time I have spent out of the state in big cities, there #8217;s a tendency to look ahead to the next big thing. People rarely seem anchored to where they live/work and are willing to jump to a better option at a moment #8217;s notice. There are pros and cons that come with a  #8220;now #8221; mindset but I have made my closest friends in Arkansas because they invest in what they have, instead of what they want/don #8217;t have. But everyone #8217;s experience is different! You may be better suited somewhere else. There are a lot of really wonderful places to live in the world.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Don't know a ton about hockey - sorry :( - but I'm trying to find information on NHL rosters. In most soccer leagues, there's a limit on how many foreigners can join clubs. For example, in MLS each team has 7-10 "international slots" but the rest of the roster must be American/Canadian. (International slots can be traded for $$, which is why some teams have more/less.) The idea is to make the league American/Canadian-centric to develop those players first. Most leagues across the world have some initiative to develop domestic players but they're all a little different. Is there anything like that in the NHL? Or lower leagues?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well so the English Premier League has ran into this issue in that the best players in the world have gravitated towards their league, but unfortunately the English players have had a hard time keeping up. You'll notice most players in the EPL aren't English, and this is a hot topic for English fans. So I wonder if it would get to a point where American/Canadians would start to get boxed out..? Although that seems fairly unlikely at this point.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well usually the top league is home for the best players, but (like mentioned in a comment above) the English Premier League is an example of not having the top players in their home country but having a top league in the world. So English players don't get developed there, which many don't like. So I guess the parallel would be if there was a wave of non-Candanians/Americans coming into the NHL and the Cs/As started losing playing time. Would the NHL respond in protecting C/A player development or just let it league take its course?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I hopped on the Watford bandwagon a year or so ago but felt like I #8217;ve had a hard time gauging expectations since then. It seems like they #8217;ve added some good pieces and aren #8217;t that far from a top half finish but I wasn #8217;t sure if that was an absurd hope.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>; ) Makes sense. I guess I #8217;m just having a hard time seeing where the true ceiling is when they had a  #8220;bad #8221; season but still avoided a relegation battle and were 3 pts from 10th. Obviously I #8217;m hoping they continue to pull in good players but I #8217;m trying to temper realistic expectations at the same time.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well i agree with your point but i think the OP #8217;s argument was to not go to La Liga games *instead* of local games, which seems fairly agreeable for most everyone. I will say that La Liga drumming up interest over here will probably help those local teams in the long run tbh. Soccer interest usually takes a bump after the WC and since we won #8217;t really be getting that this year, this could be a helpful stopgap.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The thing I was most impressed with the most was the adjustments at halftime. I didn #8217;t think we were getting enough width in the first half but Pererya started sneaking up and wide, especially on Foster #8217;s distribution. Hughes had a notable change in approach/attitude. The goal was great, obviously, but the second half his defensive shift looked much more in control. As a whole, team defending felt more patient in the second half but would still punish any poor touches by Burnley, although there were a couple of wonderful, last-ditch tackles in the first half to stop chances on goals. One thing I #8217;ve found interesting is how both Gray/Deeney like to check to the midfield, but with a midfield that can be so scrunched towards the center of the park it would either suffocate Watford #8217;s offense or overwhelm Burnley #8217;s defense with numbers in odd spots. (Deeney #8217;s goal, for example.) I #8217;m not sure which one is happening more often at the moment tbh. Sometimes I like the checking forwards as Burnley #8217;s back four were hard-pressed realizing they can #8217;t really step 20 yards upfield but other times it felt like Watford was getting in their own way. I wonder what it would look like with Gray running more diagonally behind the back line but today #8217;s offense as a whole was hard to complain about. I think my main concern right now is when Watford is transferring from defense to offense, especially in the defensive third. A number of clearances were bad but there were other times when we had time to play forward but just lumped it upfield. There were a number of times in the first half where a pass/clearance upfield quickly turned into Burnley moving back down the field. The added width helped address this but I think it can be an easy pitfall going forward. Great result today. A little slow a times but it felt intentional and is an encouraging result to build off of.</TEXT>
