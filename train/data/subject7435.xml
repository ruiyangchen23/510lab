    <TEXT>Windows 7 HP Desktop (Engineering Grade) I'm trying to copy my friend's wedding photos onto my computer so I can edit them for her in my spare time (for free). I can only get the first 500 or so to copy over. The rest won't open, preview, or copy. There are about 700 total. I think this is her only copy of her wedding photos. Ideas?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>http://www.reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews/comments/1s405k/14_year_old_with_spinal_muscular_atrophy_type_1/cdtrif7 So I thought it would be cool to take the picture in the linked news article and make him look like he is in the Winter Olympics on the USA Luge team. I thought he might like the image. I don't have my computer with PS on it today, so I thought I'd throw it to the masses. I couldn't find a great pic, but will update if I find one. I did fine the USA Luge Logo: http://i.imgur.com/rXxqiel.jpg</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey guys, I know there is a cloud draw function in CAD and even Acrobat, but is there a "cloud symbol" in ArcGIS? I never really need it, so I've never used it before. I'm trying to illustrate landscaping with a simple polygon with the cloud outline line type and a green or pattern fill. Nothing fancy. This is an example of the stuff I've found thus far. Just marker symbols and using a marker fill in a poly/oval. http://i.imgur.com/cfyd6CJ.jpg</TEXT>

    <TEXT>**Instant Plot Twist: This was yesterday** So, my dad had an outpatient surgery yesterday and I was his caretaker (along with my mom) for the rest of the day. He says he's having computer problems. As resident tech fixer for the family, this fell on me while trying to keep him on the couch. His setup you ask? A nice new (cheap) Dell Inspirion 15 with Windows 8.  gt; Me: "Wow, this is pretty new. How bad could it be?" I fire it up, loads pretty quick, everything ok. I load IE (his only browser). FOUR ASK.Com toolbars show up. Google Toolbar shows up. Some other crappy spyware toolbar shows up. I tried to take a screenshot, but it kept failing. I try to fix the toolbars, and finally do. I feel victorious. I try to download Malwarebytes, blocked by some malware. Boot to safe mode, fix the malware. Oh, quick side note- he pays 38 bucks a month for 768kbps download 256 up. You read that right. Oh, DSL in rural America. Here's where I thought I had been placed in a time machine. Me: So I finally have your IE working and I put Chrome on here and I think you should use it. Dad: Oh thanks subject7435! Me: No problem, Dad. Dad: But is AOL ok? Me: AOL... I haven't heard that name in a long time. Dad: Yea, I only use AOL I didn't even know I had "an Internet Explorer" Me: YOU USE AOL?!?!? Dad: Of course, it's how I get to the Facebook. Me: Facepalm Dad: So is AOL ok? Me: I don't think anyone even makes malware or viruses for AOL. I think you're fine. Dad: Awesome. Will youtube run fast now? Me: No, your internet is atrocious. You are screwed. Dad: STUPID F****** computers are ruining America. Me: Double facepalm, exit kitchen door and go home. Edit 1: Spelling. Edit 2: Fine, people over 30 can have Win 8 now.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>iCloud Photo Library problems</TITLE>
    <DATE>2014-12-07 04:51:31</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I went to look at a photo today and it looked rather blurry. It had a little white exclamation mark in the lower right hand corner and changed to a download progress circle almost immediately. I plugged my phone in and it only showed recent photos. I've got an iPhone 6 and have been using it and beta iCloud photos since the 6 launch. What's going on? Did my phone run out of space and delete everything locally? I'm paranoid about losing data so I don't think I've lost anything between iCloud and Amazon and google plus local backups but still, I'm confused. Help? Also why can't you pause iCloud photo backup? I have terrible DSL at home so I like to back up at work where we have great internet. I have to turn wifi off at home or my whole wifi network is useless from the photos uploading. Thanks for any help</TEXT>

Not only did she live, but she is leaving the ICU soon! Thank God for answered prayers. They had already called in the family to say their goodbyes, and she's pulling through! She has a long road ahead getting back to normal, but how wonderful it is for the children and husband to be nowhere near a funeral home this week!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Does Google Photos eat up anyone else's storage?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2015-06-01 15:56:59</DATE>
    <TEXT>I installed the app and it's been fine, but now it's caching all my photos. Including my iCloud Photo Library, somehow. The small files (1.2 mb or less so far) are all now showing up on my internal storage. They never did before. What the heck is going on? I wanted to use this to back up my photos to SAVE space, not fill up my phone with all these photos again. Google+ Photos never did that, I have been using that backup feature since it became an option. Edit: Downvotes for a question? Get a life. People can like both Google and Apple services.</TEXT>

If you don't have a newer TV, you better have a power outlet open near the tv. I have not tried doing local files on the Fire Stick, but I did so often on the Roku (I still have 1 running). The newer Rokus have USB slots, so if you want to use that kind of thing you may want a newer Roku, but the Fire Stick is cheaper.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No. These TV's will not blow you away, but they are a *great* deal. Perfect for bedrooms or kids or just to give away as a gift. Need a ~$100 present for someone at Christmas? Who doesn't want a new TV?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>First off, that's a totally ridiculous reply. They were not at an air demo. They were at the darn beach. Of course they were "improperly secured", they're not supposed to be fighting against a jet! It's irrelevant if a grandma exhaling would have also caused it, because nothing else flipped those tents. The jet did. It's a reckless endangerment of human life for a laugh.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've done 3 exchanges, and 1/3 of the gifts has been something I asked for or even considered wanted. I was happy to receive gifts, but it seems like the people who matched with me just didn't like the same things I liked. Is there going to be a way to help issues like that? For example, the one I did like, and I mean I really loved it, was from the Space exchanged. It's narrow focus really helped, I think. Anyways, still love Redditgifts. My wife did the teacher gift thing and here box showed up, completely empty. Some college girl in upstate NY saved all her money for a while to stuff the box to the brim, and it broke on the way to our local post office. It literally was a cardboard shell. She didn't get insurance so all that money went for nothing and my wife got nothing. Moral of the story, maybe we can include some packing tips? Edit: Hey Greg, what's up?</TEXT>

What's weird is I always post the video of stuff like this and the GIF at the same time but the video seriously has 2 upvotes and this has nearly 5k. It happens every time. Also someone is paying people to comment on this thread. I see very similar comments from newish accounts all supporting this woman.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Agree. I am a very conservative person, but I'm not a monster. I don't see why we can't help people. Is it expensive? Sure. Is it hard? Yes. So is every crisis. People are so hateful, for nothing. Every single one of those hateful people would be climbing onto trains and running across borders if it meant freedom and a better life for their families. This crisis is no joke. Millions of people can't go home for a long time, so we need to buckle down and help them now, in order for them to help themselves later.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>An excerpt from the book "Sled Driver" by former SR-71 pilot Brian Shul: There were a lot of things we couldn't do in an SR-71, but we were the fastest guys on the block and loved reminding our fellow aviators of this fact. People often asked us if, because of this fact, it was fun to fly the jet. Fun would not be the first word I would use to describe flying this plane. Intense, maybe, even cerebral. But there was one day in our Sled experience when we would have to say that it was pure fun to be the fastest guys out there, at least for a moment. It occurred when Walt and I were flying our final training sortie. We needed 100 hours in the jet to complete our training and attain Mission Ready status. Somewhere over Colorado we had passed the century mark. We had made the turn in Arizona and the jet was performing flawlessly. My gauges were wired in the front seat and we were starting to feel pretty good about ourselves, not only because we would soon be flying real missions but because we had gained a great deal of confidence in the plane in the past ten months. Ripping across the barren deserts 80,000 feet below us, I could already see the coast of California from the Arizona border. I was, finally, after many humbling months of simulators and study, ahead of the jet. I was beginning to feel a bit sorry for Walter in the back seat. There he was, with no really good view of the incredible sights before us and tasked with monitoring four different radios. This was good practice for him for when we began flying real missions and when a priority transmission from headquarters could be vital. It had been difficult, too, for me to relinquish control of the radios, as during my entire flying career I had controlled my own transmissions. But it was part of the division of duties in this plane and I had adjusted to it. I still insisted on talking on the radio while we were on the ground, however. Walt was so good at many things, but he couldn't match my expertise at sounding smooth on the radios, a skill that had been honed sharply with years in fighter squadrons where the slightest radio miscue was grounds for beheading. He understood that and allowed me that luxury. Just to get a sense of what Walt had to contend with, I pulled the radio toggle switches and monitored the frequencies along with him. The predominant radio chatter was from Los Angeles Center, far below us, controlling daily traffic in their sector. While they had us on their scope (albeit briefly), we were in uncontrolled airspace and normally would not talk to them unless we needed to descend into their airspace. We listened as the shaky voice of a lone Cessna pilot who asked Center for a read-out of his ground speed. Center replied: "November Charlie 175, I'm showing you at ninety knots on the ground." Now the thing to understand about Center controllers was that whether they were talking to a rookie pilot in a Cessna, or to Air Force One, they always spoke in the exact same, calm, deep, professional tone that made one feel important. I referred to it as the "Houston Center voice." I have always felt that after years of seeing documentaries on this country's space program and listening to the calm and distinct voice of the Houston controllers, that all other controllers since then wanted to sound like that and that they basically did. And it didn't matter what sector of the country we would be flying in, it always seemed like the same guy was talking. Over the years that tone of voice had become somewhat of a comforting sound to pilots everywhere. Conversely, over the years, pilots always wanted to ensure that, when transmitting, they sounded like Chuck Yeager, or at least like John Wayne. Better to die than sound bad on the radios. Just moments after the Cessna's inquiry, a Twin Beech piped up on frequency, in a rather superior tone, asking for his ground speed in the Beech. "I have you at one hundred and twenty-five knots of ground speed." Boy, I thought, the Beechcraft really must think he is dazzling his Cessna brethren. Then out of the blue, a navy F-18 pilot out of NAS Lemoore came up on frequency. You knew right away it was a Navy jock because he sounded very cool on the radios. "Center, Dusty 52 ground speed check." Before Center could reply, I'm thinking to myself, hey, Dusty 52 has a ground speed indicator in that million-dollar cockpit, so why is he asking Center for a read-out? Then I got it, ol' Dusty here is making sure that every bug smasher from Mount Whitney to the Mojave knows what true speed is. He's the fastest dude in the valley today, and he just wants everyone to know how much fun he is having in his new Hornet. And the reply, always with that same, calm, voice, with more distinct alliteration than emotion: "Dusty 52, Center, we have you at 620 on the ground." And I thought to myself, is this a ripe situation, or what? As my hand instinctively reached for the mic button, I had to remind myself that Walt was in control of the radios. Still, I thought, it must be done in mere seconds we'll be out of the sector and the opportunity will be lost. That Hornet must die, and die now. I thought about all of our Sim training and how important it was that we developed well as a crew and knew that to jump in on the radios now would destroy the integrity of all that we had worked toward becoming. I was torn. Somewhere, 13 miles above Arizona, there was a pilot screaming inside his space helmet. Then, I heard it the click of the mic button from the back seat. That was the very moment that I knew Walter and I had become a crew. Very professionally, and with no emotion, Walter spoke: "Los Angeles Center, Aspen 20, can you give us a ground speed check?" There was no hesitation, and the replay came as if it was an everyday request. "Aspen 20, I show you at one thousand eight hundred and forty-two knots, across the ground." I think it was the forty-two knots that I liked the best, so accurate and proud was Center to deliver that information without hesitation, and you just knew he was smiling. But the precise point at which I knew that Walt and I were going to be really good friends for a long time was when he keyed the mic once again to say, in his most fighter-pilot-like voice: "Ah, Center, much thanks, we're showing closer to nineteen hundred on the money." For a moment Walter was a god. And we finally heard a little crack in the armor of the Houston Center voice when L.A. came back with, "Roger that Aspen. Your equipment is probably more accurate than ours. You boys have a good one." It all had lasted for just moments, but in that short, memorable sprint across the southwest the Navy had been flamed, all mortal airplanes on frequency were forced to bow before the King of Speed, and more importantly, Walter and I had crossed the threshold of being a crew. A fine day's work. We never heard another transmission on that frequency all the way to the coast. For just one day, it truly was fun being the fastest guys out there.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>An excerpt from the book "Sled Driver" by former SR-71 pilot Brian Shul: There were a lot of things we couldn't do in an SR-71, but we were the fastest guys on the block and loved reminding our fellow aviators of this fact. People often asked us if, because of this fact, it was fun to fly the jet. Fun would not be the first word I would use to describe flying this plane. Intense, maybe, even cerebral. But there was one day in our Sled experience when we would have to say that it was pure fun to be the fastest guys out there, at least for a moment. It occurred when Walt and I were flying our final training sortie. We needed 100 hours in the jet to complete our training and attain Mission Ready status. Somewhere over Colorado we had passed the century mark. We had made the turn in Arizona and the jet was performing flawlessly. My gauges were wired in the front seat and we were starting to feel pretty good about ourselves, not only because we would soon be flying real missions but because we had gained a great deal of confidence in the plane in the past ten months. Ripping across the barren deserts 80,000 feet below us, I could already see the coast of California from the Arizona border. I was, finally, after many humbling months of simulators and study, ahead of the jet. I was beginning to feel a bit sorry for Walter in the back seat. There he was, with no really good view of the incredible sights before us and tasked with monitoring four different radios. This was good practice for him for when we began flying real missions and when a priority transmission from headquarters could be vital. It had been difficult, too, for me to relinquish control of the radios, as during my entire flying career I had controlled my own transmissions. But it was part of the division of duties in this plane and I had adjusted to it. I still insisted on talking on the radio while we were on the ground, however. Walt was so good at many things, but he couldn't match my expertise at sounding smooth on the radios, a skill that had been honed sharply with years in fighter squadrons where the slightest radio miscue was grounds for beheading. He understood that and allowed me that luxury. Just to get a sense of what Walt had to contend with, I pulled the radio toggle switches and monitored the frequencies along with him.

    <TEXT>Not owner, just in resident "IT" guy that's not really an IT guy. The IT people I deal with are mostly fine, but they do not communicate well. Our conference room router was broken and they didn't tell us. They just would remote in and reboot every few days. Well, I figure it out using Ookla and tell them. That's when the truth comes out. They weren't lying or anything, they just figured we didn't care or need to know. We cared, and had a huge meeting with no WiFi because they didn't tell us. That's just one example, but I'd pin a lot of problems on communications.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Fellow Four Aces fan here. I really just wonder sometimes, how will they ever beat that? When I was a kid we had a random tornado come near out house and had to take shelter. I took the most valuable possession (to me) I owned into the basement- my Greg Maddux framed baseball card. Not signed or anything, just the card in a frame. Man, that guy could probably still get 20 wins a year. It's not like it matters if he lost any speed.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; I had issues on my SP3. I just went into device manager and disabled the trackpad and keyboard from being able to wake the device while sleeping. This means you have to press the power button in order to pull your device out of sleep, but it stops eating your battery and accidently turning on in your bag. You can see exactly what is bringing your device out of sleep by running powercfg -lastwake on a command prompt.  gt; http://lifehacker.com/how-find-out-what-woke-up-your-computer-last-1550549116[1]  gt; Disable what ever is waking your computer from being able to wake your computer from device manager.

A heck of a lot of them died in the gas chambers. This isn't the same, you're right. These people are already being massacred and we still seek isolation and retreat from terror.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Agreed. Anytime we try to fix something, the trolls come out and say "NO FIX THIS THING FIRST I FORGOT ABOUT" We should have fixed homeless verterans forever ago, but that doesn't mean we are stuck in a ditch policy wise until that problem is fixed. A ton of that issue is mental health, where we're also stuck. A ton of that issue is government spending, where we're also stuck. A ton of that issue is the role of government, where we're also stuck. It's easy to reject things. It's hard to solve them. We're a nation who trys to solve things, rather than reject them.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I got a double stroller on Amazon for about $130 USD instead of the normal $290 USD price just because I saw they were on sale, so keep a look out for the things you need wherever you shop and be ready to buy them. I always tell my wife that if we are 100% sure we need something and it's on sale, buy it then rather than later. It's saved us tons of $$$. Thankfully they are both girls (identical too) so they can share a lot of clothes. We already started buying diapers. We did that with my son and it helped a lot. I just bought a box every time I bought other groceries. That softened the transition. The hardest part honestly is the medical bills, but I guess that's more of a US specific problem.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Make an official EPA complaint. Whatever version of the environmental health department is in CA, do the same. Call them out on social media constantly and seek media attention. NPR has done well with Flint and may be the best bet. Sounds like the citizens need to seek a pro bono environmental engineering expert in the area to assist. Wastewater? They all have NPDES permits, or some state variant. Look them up. It's all public, even the test results. Do an official state records request, some of the stuff may even be online. Exceeding your permit for wastewater is a big deal and should leave a paper trail. I do this kind of research a lot.</TEXT>

They should be under a consent order or basically a court mandated program to fix it which doesn't give them any wiggle room to lie, or be lazy. Those are no joke and should not be in the water above permitted limits. Still file an EPA complaint and FOIA. The FOIA are usually free or cheap.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My favorite color used to be green. Ever since I was a little boy I had green hats, shirts, shorts, etc. That's what drew me to camouflage clothes. It was those endless hours playing Army in my backyard that put the thought in my mind that maybe I should join. After my mom died when I was 15, I felt lost. Then, an Army recruiter came to my school and he had that great green uniform on. That uniform meant hope, and I needed that hope. After graduation, I enlisted. You always think you're going to be something great and memorable when you join the Army, but you never think you'll literally be a garbage man. That's me, the great green patriotic garbage man. Our latest endeavor is the freak F5 tornado in the middle of the desert. Some people are saying it's near Area 51, but we'll see when this C-130 lands what hole in the wall it really is. *two hours later* This mission seems... different. I've never had to turn over my phone before, let alone be strip searched for other "devices". As we get closer to the destruction, you can clearly see the tornado's path etched into the sand. I can't help but think it will be that way for years to come. Up ahead, we see tons of sheet metal slung for miles around in this great old dry lake. The metal shifted to obvious sections of planes and munitions. Then, things get weirder. I've always said my favorite color is green, but I can't stand the site of it after what lies before me. Pools of green liquid go for as far as the eye can see ahead. Green...blood. It's hard to comprehend but each of these small reflective pools of death are directly under these small creatures. This can't be. How are there so many? Thousands and thousands of little creatures pierced with debris or torn apart from the monster tornado. "THIS ONE'S TALKING!" my buddy says to me. We rush over and can hear the last gasps of this little creature, no bigger than my old shitzu my mom got me when she got sick to keep me company. As we knelt down beside it, we could barely hear the words escape for it's mouth. It's English! "Your planet is a strange place, young man" he says to me. "Do not let my people be forgotten, we have been trapped in this place for years, only to be freed by certain death from that awful wind". "Take this" he says. My buddy and I look on in shock as he hands us a small sphere glowing a bright purple, as he hands it to me the green fluid is oozing from his injured hands on to mine. At this point my buddy has nearly passed out, but he and I both hear the helicopters coming in quickly. "Your world deserves to know they're not alone" he says. Then, his small eyes close and his body turns from the light grey it was to nearly as black as charcoal. We rise from beside his body and see the thousands of small black corpses with now a lake of green fluid surrounding them. I slipped the little sphere in my pocket and went about my work as the higher ups came near the creature's body that spoke to us. "He's dead" one General said. "Then they all will be soon" said a man in a lab coat. I couldn't help but wonder what this little sphere was, but I knew I had to wait to find out. I waited only a few minutes before a strange ship appeared above me, about the size of a small house, and opened up a large cargo door. I began to float slowly into the ship.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My wife just gave birth and is on medication and accidentally deleted our imessage conversation on her iphone. i haven't backed up her phone since she found out she was preganant and apparently her icloud backup has been full for years. I know our conversation is still showing up on her old iPad that was plugged in thankfully. Has everything up until today. How do I get the messages back on to her phone? Please help me, she's a wreck about this.</TEXT>

Couldn't I just wipe her phone and iMessage would recover it as a new phone? It seems crazy its two taps to accidentally delete years of messages</TEXT>
