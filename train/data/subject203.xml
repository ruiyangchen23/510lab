    <TEXT>I have a flipphone, and my contract ends in January. I'm definitely going with a Nexus (So please don't offer anything else). Should I wait for this LG Nexus or go with the Galaxy? The only thing I wouldn't be happy about with the galaxy is the camera (Which isn't terrible, much better than my 2MP!) and the battery (upgradeable). I really dig this new supposed nexus' design, but I don't know about cost. What should I do?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>What if in Minecraft, there were these mutant-ish villagers who lived underground? They could have the same/similar character models as normal villagers, but they'd be green or something. They could be neutral and have trading, but instead of things that you could get above ground (food, wood, etc) they'd trade stuff like ore, ingots, or maybe new items. I think that'd be really cool, and seeing how great Reddit is, I wouldn't be surprised if Mojang could fit this in before Halloween! Also, there could be Village variations which would be really cool</TEXT>

    <DATE>2012-10-19 04:55:17</DATE>
    <TEXT>So it's 10:00. I'm in Marching Band and we have a 4-hour drive to St. Louis in the morning. I have to get up early, so I'm trying to download movies/TV shows so I can get them on my tablet and get to sleep for the early ride. I don't torrent. I don't know how, and I'm not really interested in learning how, I'm pretty tired. A few minutes ago, I found a website with download links to all the files I need. The bad thing is, it's one of those "Super-Slow Free/Super-Fast Premium" things. I downloaded one episode of Breaking Bad, and it took an hour. After much searching, I find the guy who runs the actual website. I talked to him for quite some time. Turns out that he's an amazing guy, someone I'd probably hang out with in real life. Anyway, he gave me a password for the Premium thing for 24-hours so I can get my downloads done and get to sleep. This really makes me happy, which is why I'm returning the favor by donating first thing in the morning. So, what random acts of kindness have you received and how have they affected you?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>J. Edgar looks a LOT like Lincoln- Iconic director, amazing cast, cool concept, similar black-and-white-ish camera work, but it turned out to be a dud. Does anyone else think Lincoln looks like this? Sure it has things like war scenes and isn't a pure biopic, but J. Edgar had that explosion scene which was really underwhelming. Thoughts?</TEXT>

If a class is given a test each week, and the average grade is the one grade that everyone gets, some of the struggling students will not study, hoping that the smarter kids' grades will get them a good grade, and as this continues, the entire class ultimately fails?</TEXT>

Extortion- The practice of obtaining something, esp. money, through force or threats. He's trying to obtain college records using a moral threat with his own monetary gain... Thoughts?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Before you take to the comments, consider this: A 16 GB Version Costs $329, But a 32GB iPod Touch is $300 The iPad mini has terrible ppi and doesn't have retina, but the cheaper iPod touch has Retina display The iPad mini has a WORSE processor than the new iPod Touch, which is cheaper The iPad mini has a WORSE camera than the new iPod Touch. Seriously, you're paying more money for a slightly bigger screen that isn't retina, a worse camera, a slower processor, and less memory.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Why must you discriminate against a younger group of people just because they're ready to experience a great game with you? Just because they're younger doesn't mean they'll be ridiculous idiots on multiplayer, and if they are, MUTE THEM. I'm a sophomore in high school now, and I experienced the first halo game in 2nd Grade. I absolutely loved it, and still love it to this day. This is a younger generation about to experience the beginning of an amazing trilogy- why must we discriminate? I understand that many (MANY MANY MANY) of the Midnight Release pictures are hilarious, but please don't assume that you'll have a bad multiplayer experience simply because there's a few kids ready to experience what might be one of the best trilogies in gaming</TEXT>

    <DATE>2012-11-07 01:26:52</DATE>
    <TEXT>My favorite Pixar piece is "Ratatouille". The film is definitely an inspiration to find your passion and run with it. The movie explores humanity, our emotional and physical abilities, and things such as first impressions and judgements. This is my favorite animated movie of all time, and for quite some time, inspired me to become a chef. However, upon multiple viewings of the film itself and of others, the movie's themes of creation carried true and helped me find my true calling: Film Editing.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2012-11-07 23:52:56</DATE>
    <TEXT>So in my Personal Finance class, this kid who sits next to me thought he knew everything about the election- he was "100% sure" Romney would win, and he still calls Obama a Socialist (I've pointed out that not once has he defined Socialism, nor have his attempts come close). Anyway, even though he was 100% sure Romney won, our class takes what we learn to marketwatch.com where we do virtual stock trading, he decided he would sell ALL his shares of Apple, Google, and Enron, and put it all in Democratic energy futures (Renewable resource companies, stuff like that). Today, I strolled into class, happier than usual. The FIRST thing he says "That socialist bastard crashed the market". I explained that it was because investors were simply getting rid of stocks in case something happened they weren't prepared for, yet he claimed it was all because of Obama. After the bell rang, everyone logged into their game, and wouldn'tya know, he'd made $5000+ and was #1 in class, 43% more profitable than the next leading guy!</TEXT>

I always thought mercury was very mysterious and intriguing, as was the moon. If you look at mercury (the planet) it's essentially the moon, and "Mercury Fiction" has a better ring than "Moon Fiction". If someone is willing to make me a logo that could fit the mystery of Mercury, I'd give full credit wherever I use it and (possibly) purchase Reddit gold. I'd very much like if one of you helped me out.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2012-12-23 19:25:17</DATE>
    <TEXT>I know playing MC in-browser isn't the most common thing, but long-story-short, I couldn't download Minecraft to a computer I was on, and sadly, most of the servers I played on were 1.4.5 and not 1.4.6. Minecraft needs to have a feature both in-browser and client-based where you can easily switch between versions. I'm not talking about switching from a legit to a hacked client, but switching between different jars, with the same ease it takes to switch between texture packs. If you see a server that's 1.4.5 and not 1.4.6, instead of googling "minecraft 1.4.5 jar" and probably downloading a keylogger or trojan, Mojang should just implement a system where you can very easily switch between version histories, virus and hassle free.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>My thoughts on Pulp Fiction... *SPOILERS*</TITLE>
    <DATE>2012-12-26 19:31:27</DATE>
    <TEXT>I recently watched Pulp Fiction, and thought I'd say how I felt. I don't expect this to get karma, so don't judge too harshly. I loved Pulp Fiction, and I feel it had the best, most natural dialogue of any movie I've ever seen. I loved the way it wasn't in chronological order, and even though John Travolta gets shot, the way it ended gives you the feeling that he is alright, which I really admire. I wasn't a big fan of the long, empty pauses, and I don't think it's Tarentino's best (I can't stress how much I love Inglourious Basterds), but it's definitely a great movie. What do you think of Pulp Fiction/other tarentino films?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Why I'm ditching Verizon and getting a Nexus 4...</TITLE>
    <DATE>2013-01-03 17:21:36</DATE>
    <TEXT>I don't really expect this to do well, I just figured I'd share my story. If, in case, this does well, may I preemtively thank you for reading this and hope you enjoy :) I've been with Verizon for 2 years now. Never really been dissappointed with the service. From what I've experienced and from what I've heard from others, it truly is the best carrier. However, I really hate this whole "Share Everything" plan. Not only is it terrible, but they're most likely switching all of their plans to a "Share Everything" system. Also, I hate having a data cap; it doesn't let me do what I want and I feel paranoid about going over. Verizon's phone selection isn't terrible, but they've really pushed the "Droid" system, and if their Galaxy Nexus updates didn't take so long, I'd be fine staying with them, but that's just not the case. I plan on switching to T-Mobile, AND I RECOMMEND THIS TO ALL USERS BUYING A NEXUS 4: You can get 100 Minutes, Unlimited Text and Unlimited Data. The data is at 4G speeds for the first 5gb then it's throttled down, but 5gb is a LOT of data to burn through before you hit the throttle. What I really like about this is the fact that the Nexus 4 ISN'T LTE. Many people claim this is an issue, but I see it as a benefit: You don't go through so much data as fast, and the battery performs better than it's competitors. TL;DR, Verizon is expensive and doesn't push updates, T-Mobile has a better no-contract plan and Nexus 4 Wins</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Rules: You don't have to fit in. If you want to live on the Black Pearl you don't have to be a pirate to do so. You have to be prepared for what happens. If you want to live at Hogwarts, get ready for a battle in 7 years. Your presence won't disturb the characters/events, but as listed above, you must be prepared for the coming events/fend for yourself if needed (ie if you want to live on the ship in Alien, you can't say "Oh, I'm going to be the one to kill the Alien or kill Sigourney Weaver to save billions of ore and be a trillionaire lolololololol") I would DEFINITELY pick Rivendell from LOTR and The Hobbit. Absolutely perfect and beautiful. Runner up would be the Shire, and 3rd would be Wayne Manor/the Batcave in Nolan's trilogy. EDIT: Thought of a good one: Island from Moonrise Kingdom</TEXT>

    <TITLE>How often do you truly buy a new phone/think most consumers do?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2013-01-09 02:20:12</DATE>
    <TEXT>I know r/Android isn't your everyday-android consumer group, but I was wondering- How often do you buy a new phone, and how often do you think most consumers do? I see all these things about new phones with physical keyboards in the touchscreens and Nokia making Android and blah blah blah, but how often do you really buy a new phone? I've had a flip phone for a while, and the Nexus 4 was my first android phone (Of course, I did 2 years of research as smartphones evolved, so I watched from the sidelines, per se) and here's how I see things: *****When a newer, better phone comes out, your phone doesn't become any worse. Everything that was good about your phone before is just as good now***** Personally, I think people who buy new phones just because they're the newest and greatest are IDIOTS! Most consumers can just buy a phone and stick with it, and I'm perfectly content with a Nexus 4- it's the best experience Android has delivered thus far, imo. However, one of the many problems with the smartphone industry is idiots! "Oh look, its the iPhone 5! There's not much different about it, mostly just a slightly bigger screen. They added some stuff, but it's still years behind Android.. I'm gonna slap $500 on that motherfucker just like I did on my 4S less than a year ago, and the 4 before that!". Apple users aren't the only ones. "Droid Razr comes out? I'm gonna drop $200 the day it comes out, then they'll drop the price $100 the next month. Then, when the Droid Razr HD comes out, even though it's thicker than the original and my first Razr is just as good, I'll drop $200 more on it, just 'cause its so shiny". I don't mean to stereotype, but let's face it- a majority of consumers are idiots when it comes to buying phones. I didn't mean for this to turn from a question to a rant, and sorry, but that's just my opinion. What do you think? TL;DR- Consumers buy the newest piece of shit like idiots and it's pissing me off.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've never been a fan of Nellie or Gabe, but Robert California seemed promising when he was introduced, but since he's off and didn't really fulfill that humor that was shown in the 'Search Party' episodes, I'm going to have to say that Erin is the only newer character I've liked.

    <TEXT>The show is finally coming to a close, and with such a large and highly active fan base, I think it'd be cool for the Reddit community to be able to talk to most of them, or at least some. I've immensely enjoyed watching the show all these years, as has millions of others. So, let's make it happen! (My questions are definitely subject to change since it's very hard to get an entire cast of actors to answer questions on Reddit) 1. What is your favorite memory of the show? 2. After the departure of Steve, have you feel the show's vibe has changed, and how is working without him like? 3. Did any of you know who was going to replace Steve? Were you trying to replace him as actors as much as your characters were? 4. How active is Ricky Gervais with the show? 5. Any thoughts you have that you'd like to share with the community? We've all loved the show</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I understand that this post may sound like I just watched 'Bering Sea Gold' one-too many times, but I have an idea. The ocean, frankly, isn't good for much. You have clay, but that's really the only use for it. I was wondering what would happen if gold were to spawn on the first 1-3 layers of the ocean floor. This would give incentive for exploring the ocean, and would provide a possible danger if you were to drown. I understand Minecraft's last worry is realism, but I see a lot of benefits to this and many ways players could accomodate something such as this. Food for thought</TEXT>

    <TITLE>What is your prediction for the 3rd Tarantino "Rewriting History" Film?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2013-02-17 19:52:10</DATE>
    <TEXT>For those of you who didn't know, Quentin Tarantino announced that Inglourious Basterds and Django Unchained were 2 of 3 films in a saga of rewriting history. What do you think his 3rd will be about? If I were to guess, I'd go out on a limb and say... well I can't think of anything! I'd say it has to be something violent in history (i.e. slavery, WWII) but it can't be something he's already done (i.e. slavery, WWII) *EDIT: He's obviously not going to do war or slavery again, so stop saying he is, that's like Stephen Spielberg going back and doing Lincoln 2 about Lincoln's son or some crap like that*</TEXT>

    <TITLE>What do you want from the "Next Nexus"?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2013-03-22 23:35:50</DATE>
    <TEXT>Don't just say "customizable hardware"- this is a theoretical thread, you can say any specs you want, and although customizable hardware is a very big possibility, this is simply theoretical, not what you think will happen, but what you want. I'm hoping for a 4.8-inch or larger screen. Now, the resolution could go one of two ways; if it's a 1080p screen, I definitely want 64gb- files to support 1080p are very large and 64gb seems like a lot, but I'd rather be safe than sorry (I also wouldn't mind not having a MicroSD if I could get 64gb). If it's a 720p screen, I'd be happy with 32gb as long as I had a MicroSD slot. I wouldn't care if it's AMOLED or LCD+, as long as the ppi is good, along with contrasts and reporudction- I'm happy. Assuming it's made from Motorola, I'd be somewhat happy with their industrialized look, as long as it isn't branded with "M's like most of their phones are. I personally think the LG Nexus 4 is the 2nd most beautiful device on the market now (Behind the HTC One). Although, of course, I'd much rather have the premium, aluminum build of the One (It looks like an iPhone if it were made with more of a Macintosh appeal). I'd be fine without MicroSD if I could get a 64gb model, but anything less and I'd definitely feel safer w/ SD. Removable battery really isn't a must for me, so I don't really care about that, as long as it's 2300+ mAh. What do you want from the Next Nexus? EDIT: On Screen Buttons for sure. I wouldn't be crazy over a home button, but if it does a GS3-thing where it gives more screen space, i'd be okay with it. EDIT*: Forgot to mention this; sapphire screen EDIT**: In no way do I want an Octa-Core processor, it has the same power/speed of a Snapdragon S4 Pro, or a 600, and most likely consumes more power than either latter. I'm more than happy with an S4 Pro still, but a 600 would be more than welcome</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Question for owners of multiple/previous MBP's</TITLE>
    <DATE>2013-06-18 12:44:00</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm looking to purchase a MBP (Non-Retina, its not upgradeable internally, has no optical drive, and is much too expensive) and I'm pretty set on getting a 15 inch. I'm looking to do video editing for film school, and the 15 inch comes with a dedicated graphics card and a better screen/processor for editing. Does anyone own both a 13 and 15 inch? Can you testify to better graphical performance?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>So I saw World War Z last night</TITLE>
    <DATE>2013-06-20 18:59:16</DATE>
    <TEXT>I work at a movie theater, and I'd like to tell you about World War Z Going into it, I was expecting a mid-summer action flop with no heart or smartness to it. I was wrong about one. Although the film is very smart at times, there is absolutely NO character development whatsoever. It opens with Brad making breakfast for his family, then immediately the outbreak happens. Aside from this, I was still very impress, it was MUCH more enjoyable than Man of Steel. Although it was very enjoyable and smart at times, the film definitely seemed rushed. Although I liked the fact that the outbreak/action happens so early, it definitely feels like a lot was cut out from it in the beginning. The third act (which was rewritten by Lindeloff and reshot extensively) was a very pleasing ending for what it was, it was DEFINITELY climactic and VERY intense. We saw the film in 3D and in our enhanced theater (which was in Dolby Atmos) and the 3D was nothing to write home about, but the sound was amazing. As I said, the editing and character development lacked, but the cinematography did not. At one point, they exit a ship so they can refuel and open the doors to a silent, foggy runway with no visibility, and it so definitely quite the action sequence. I'd also say most of the characters are actually pretty smart for an action movie, yet Brad Pitt realizes one of the Zombie's weaknesses in a very unbelievable way. Other than the fact that one of the characters conveniently slips and shoots himself in the face (very, very minor character, no spoiler), I'd say most of them make pretty good decisions for a zombie movie. In the end, I'd say it was a fantastic zombie and action film that lacked in some serious places, yet shined in most. For what it was, its an intense yet epic summer movie, and is much better than Man of Steel. I'd give it 3 out of 4 stars.</TEXT>

It looks absolutely perfect, and I can't wait for it. The Monuments' Men also looks amazing, specifically with it's cast and considering Clooney's writing chops with The Ides of March. The Secret Life of Walter Mitty also looks incredible, especially the cinematography. Thoughts? What movies are you looking forward to? **EDIT: Added: American Hustle (Thanks A_Fish_Called_Water), Gravity, Interstellar, The Counselor (Thanks herisatoptip**</TEXT>

    <TITLE>"Place Beyond The Pines" Symbolism [SPOILERS]</TITLE>
    <DATE>2013-09-20 22:59:49</DATE>
    <TEXT>I just bought Place Beyond The Pines, and for those who haven't seen it, I highly recommend watching it. Since this is my 2nd viewing, I began watching with an eye for metaphors, symbolism, and imagery. At the beginning, the three motorcyclists in the ball of death CLEARLY foreshadows/presents itself as the rest of the film; Luke, Avery, and their Sons' lives are all interdependent, and in the end, they all come crashing. If one of the motorcyclists goes too fast or slow, it will affect the others and probably kill/injure them. While the film's three motorcyclists represent a dangerous, static lifestyle, Luke's Son riding off into the sunset on his *own* motorcycle shows that he has broken away from his father's legacy and is moving on to begin his own, independent life.</TEXT>

[what does he say here]" It sounds to me like he says "Your skill set? Shit ham" or something like that. If anyone can let me know what he says, it'd be incredibly appreciated.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2013-11-21 00:21:42</DATE>
    <TEXT>One of the many benefits to having a Nexus or Google Edition phone is the promise of getting updates upon their release. Its been over two weeks, and as a Nexus 4 owner, I'm pissed. Albeit the Nexus (but not Google Edition) phone(s) are notoriously cheap, I went with a Nexus over something else for the promise of quick OTA updates. One or two days is understandable, but 2 weeks?! The Moto X with a skin is getting 4.4 before the Nexus 4! I think that if Google isn't going to deliver on their promise of quick updates to their devices, we should be reimbursed with Play Store credit.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Nexus 4 Red Light Problem</TITLE>
    <DATE>2014-01-17 04:07:02</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hey r/nexus4! I have and have loved my nexus 4 up until today; I recently got the "red light" problem. My phone's notification LED will display only a red light. It is plugged into my computer, and is not recognized at all by the computer. The screen displays the battery filling up, but not the battery with a lightning bolt that indicates it's charging. I've tried nearly everything and have no clue what to do. Can anyone help? If anyone provides a solution which fixes it (that doesn't require sending it into Google) **i will send a code for $25 of Google Play Store credit**</TEXT>

    <DATE>2014-08-21 04:22:30</DATE>
    <TEXT>I personally see so much advancement in the Strokes that it's hard to pinpoint a specific direction that they're headed. I think (and hope) we'll be hearing more of Julian's falsetto, but considering the directions that he and Albert are taking with solo projects, I think their next album will end up being a curated work of art between 5 extremely talented musicians. What do you think? This can be expressed in terms of sounds, vibes, or general decision-making.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks for taking the time to read this! This will potentially be my first fountain pen purchase, and I'm comparing two of them.

Does anyone have any experience with it, or others like it? [I also really like this Jinhao pen](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00LFJFR4O/ref=gno_cart_title_0?ie=UTF8 amp;psc=1 amp;smid=A2Q00EEXTT9NQ0). Recommendations? Thanks for reading this, be sure to let me know if you've had experience with either pen company.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2014-09-24 16:53:43</DATE>
    <TEXT>Listening to Johan Von Bronx on Tyranny, I'm quickly realizing something here; this album is a lot like what First Impressions of Earth was for The Strokes! It took a darker turn yet kept a lot of the familiar melodies that the Strokes are known for. Tyranny has so much grit to it, I think you can closely parallel Phrazes to Is This It and Room on Fire and can consider Tyranny the second chapter in Julian's career, just like First Impressions acted like a second chapter for The Strokes</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey r/USC! I appreciate you taking the time to read this. As a prospective USC student and future applicant, I absolutely love everything about USC (that I've seen) and really hope I can get in. I have about a 3.5 GPA and take high-level AP classes. I got a 32 on my ACT (33 Superscore) and feel confident in my extracurriculars (founder of 2 school clubs, varsity debate and highest-level achievements in band). I was wondering if anyone has any universal tips for applying to USC and their experiences with the application process. Thanks!!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I just watched Rounders last night, and I thought it was absolutely amazing. It reminded me of a David Fincher film produced by Stephen Spielberg, in that the plot/dialogue/filming felt like a dark, Fincher-esque mood, but with a mainstream, hollywood Spielberg touch. I thought it was a fantastic film that really highlights the fantastic acting of Matt Damon, Edward Norton, and even John Turturro.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>My 2015 Moto X Pure was shipped with a broken screen, what should I do?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2015-09-20 20:39:53</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hey /r/MotoX! I just recently got my Moto X pure and was shocked to see when I opened the box that the top right corner of the screen was shattered with damage extending through the body of the phone. I upgraded from my 2013 Moto X and had made a claim under the warranty when that device had trouble and didn't have to pay a single cent to get it repaired. Now, in checking Moto's website, I can only find how to request a repair or replacement at a cost. I didn't buy the extended warranty, but the phone was shipped this way. I considered getting the glass repaired at a local store but the screen is now registering incorrect inputs and I have no clue what to do. Has this happened to anyone else/what advice do you have for me?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Coming up from a 50ug test :)))))</TITLE>
    <DATE>2015-10-06 05:10:26</DATE>
    <TEXT>Holy shit guys, this is the real deal! If anyone here is subscribed here because they like LSD, because they like 1P_LSD, or if they just think they might order 1P_LSD sometime in the future, I can't really say much more than holy shit right now. I'm well versed in drugs but have yet to experience LSD, and this 50ug dose is going swimmingly well. I can also say Siberian Breaks by MGMT is kicking my ass, I'm only 2 hours in but I'll try and update this as an informal trip report. I've got 4 1/2 tabs left and I plan on doing a 1 1/2 tab trip on Saturday and will be delivering that in the form of an official trip report. For now, I can't even hope to describe to you how beautiful music is. I highly recommend "Congratulations" by MGMT as your comeup album, I've used it for shrooms and 1P now and it's just perfect. Alright guys I'll quit rambling, gotta enjoy my time. I'll provide updates when I can! EDIT: That was spectacular! I made a little bit of a mistake taking my half-tab at 8:00 PM, however I knew what I was getting in to. This substance is *identical* to real LSD, period. I apologize for the informal nature of this report, but I most definitely plan on doing a more in-depth report on Saturday at a higher dose. For anyone wanting to take their first step into 1P-LSD or even LSD for that matter, 50ug is perfect. To be frank, while tripping I had the realization that everyone thinks their first trip on a new substance will be "perfect" at any dose, but I really think 50ug had a lot of great things going for it. First of all, the visuals were very nice but not overwhelming. Color saturation and mild pattern/geometric distortion was present, but not "in-your-face" and I could definitely see that being a pro in regards to your first time with a new substance. In terms of what LSD/1P offers, the headspace is the most daunting simply due to it being so drastically different than your sober self. I found myself able to control it very easily at such a low dose, yet it still kind of "pulled" me along. I felt like I was on a full trip, yet was still able to manage my thoughts and actions. I went to a local restaurant about two hours after the comeup and peaked in an extremely crowded environment; it wasn't overwhelming and I really think 50ug is just enough to get your feet wet with this substance. Aside from all that, I'll see you guys on Saturday, and I can't wait to get that full 150ug experience! I also can't recommend "Congratulations" by MGMT enough, try turning it on roughly 30 minutes after you put your tab(s) in ;)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Something funny from when I started listening to The Strokes</TITLE>
    <DATE>2015-11-13 21:33:19</DATE>
    <TEXT>I just remembered something earlier today, something I look back as being really silly. When I started listening to The Strokes (not hearing singles but actually listening to them) I didn't know the exact order of their albums. I started with Angles when that came out, then I got the other three, knowing that Is This It came first, and knowing a bit about their backstory. After listening constantly and repeatedly to all four albums, I assumed that First Impressions came before Room on Fire. I thought that the success of Is This It only further manifested the alcohol and drug problems of Julian and the other guys, and that First Impressions came right after it, with that album really being darker and more dramatic than ITI. I thought they made Room on Fire after FIOE, attempting to recapture the sound of ITI, but tired and duller after the experience of FIOE. I listened to those albums that way for such a long time, assuming that First Impressions was the "drug" album and Room on Fire was the attempt to recapture their old sound. Now I look back on it as being really funny, I remember finding out that I had the order wrong, my mind was blown.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[H] Artisan Walnut MFLB + Moto 360 [W] Arizer Air/Solo, Pax 1/2 Vaporizer</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-02-01 22:18:28</DATE>
    <TEXT>[Here are some pictures of the MFLB and recent ones of the Moto 360.](http://imgur.com/a/cvYS4) The Magic Flight is a premium Walnut wood and is the "Energy in Motion" design with a genuine Opal gem for the lock mechanism of the lid. Comes with the Magic Flight tin, paper guide, batteries, charger, and unit itself. The Moto 360 is a Stainless Steel smartwatch that works on Android devices *and* on iPhones; it is a Day 1 unit that still functions flawlessly and gets me through more than a day and a half of heavy use. If you have questions about it, feel free to ask me or check out /r/AndroidWear. Comes with the watch, premium Horween leather band, and OEM wireless charger. This MFLB is no longer being produced and retailed at $120 when I purchased it, and the Moto 360 cost $250 upon purchase. While the original retail of both of these items is $370, I understand depreciation and am asking for one of the following vaporizers: * Arizer Solo ($130-150 New Retail) * Arizer Air ($150-170 New Retail) * Pax ($250 Original Retail) * Pax 2 ($250 Retail) I feel the value of what I have is fairly even/greater than the value of what one of these four vaporizers would be. The items I have listed are both functioning perfectly and have only minor cosmetic scratches. Feel free to ask me any questions!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not necessarily, this is definitely exactly what will happen as a result of increasing taxes at the rate he wants, anyone who understands and regularly reads economic studies knows what that disclaimer means, and its simply that those shifts in demand isn't being measured in this study, likely because it's **not significant** enough of data to affect the GDP in this instance of analyzing the tax plan. You also can't predict four years of the economy, and analyzing economic shifts is prediction whereas this is a purely mathematical model with many constants and it is one which measures what **will** happen, not what *can*.</TEXT>

First of all, the people who know Ron Paul know that he wouldn't endorse Trump in a million years, that's almost as likely as him endorsing Sanders.

Third, no one fucking goes to ronpaul.com Fourth, we've known for **three years** that he doesn't own that website, no one in their right minds legitimately believes it's his endorsement of Trump on the website he doesn't own or operate.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Flowermate is garbage next to an Air. I'd recommend a Magic Flight to a beginner over the Flowermate any day- it'll last so much longer and by learning to use it you learn more about vaporization and breathing technique than anything else I know of. That said, the Air blows everything below $200 out of the water.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The MF has a lifetime warranty, and the ease of just having one and some batteries is never underestimated once you move on to session or stronger on-demand pieces- the Magic Flight is unique and provides an experience that most find themselves returning to as an enhanced way to vape and enjoy their bud. The FM will only get worse over time and eventually break. The MF is a personal tool you can care for and maintain and have it last a lifetime.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Is This It feels very thematically grounded in a realistic, taken-aback narrative front man from New York. The album centers relationship, family, and existential issues using bright, hot, repeating strokes of guitar, bass, and drum so impeccably timed that the project proved brilliance, or maybe a permanent expectation or brilliance, from The Strokes as revolutionizing rock, pop, and meaningful music with a mainstream appeal. Room on Fire is the second half of Is This It- many songs on the record follow the same contours of their predecessor leading to a sophomore effort that's extremely worthwhile and that works well. Julian drives deeper into instrumentally conducting his bandmates with music thats fundamentally similar yet sonically experimenting, complimenting it with lyrics that go deeper into more mature themes of love, hate, and all in between. This album came through largely on its own and is the last effort lead almost solely by Julian. First Impressions if Earth comes after a long wait by many, and it lands with much more emotional and instrumental baggage that much of the mainstream finds inaccessible or too outlandish. I, however, love this album for its sincerity and timing- lyrics this time around point to subtlety outlining drug and alcohol addiction, stress between people, and existentialism that comes at a time when The Strokes were dying for a break. This comes around before the many shakeups and breakups and is our true last look into the band "The Strokes". Angles, released after multiple solo records and a long, sobering hiatus, brings with it sounds unheard before from any other Strokes record. Neon synths, electronic drums, falsetto and more align a series of songs that each feel like an individual project in the amount of time it took to make the album. Not to say it's a bad thing, the album really is a collection of sonically consistent songs that reflect the band's distance from one another yet highlights individual musical abilities more than anything before. Comedown Machine is the most Strokes-y album since ITI- it was made, it was made well, and it was released. With no tour or promotion, the Strokes made a statement of getting out of their RCA deal and simply made a really good album. It seems to have the least overall lyrical theme, yet sonically is incredibly consistent, toying with newer sounds and more skilled instrumentals.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Libertarians are based on principle, not on party. We identify 50% with a liberal social ideology, and 50% with a conservative economic ideology. We believe both of these maximize liberty, the ability for all Americans to exercise their constitutional rights to freedom with as little barriers as possible. The important part there is that we believe in as *little* as possible. Libertarians believe the fundamental purpose of government should be to protect your rights. Recognizing the modern-day necessity for certain things, such as roads, hospitals, or schools, most libertarians pragmatically assess the world and believe certain public services shouldn't be removed. Where we lie on the American political spectrum is dependent upon the state of the two-party system, which we are independent from. If, say, we had a Republican president who held conservative economic *and" social policy, you would be calling us Liberals. Only due to the current state of government, not the elect, that we are currently called, but do not identify as, further right.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>My encounter with Julian</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-12-07 04:20:41</DATE>
    <TEXT>So the other day, I'm hanging out. My cousin Maya lives in New York and we were hanging out at her loft over Thanksgiving. Me and some family were visiting the city, but me and my buddy who I took with me on the trip came over to Maya's. We're ballin, having the time of our lives on Wii Sports. I'm sinkin three's, *swish* *swish* *swish*. Maya, who was refereeing the game, gets a phone call. "One minute", she says. I lost focus at that moment, becoming engrossed in my game - sinkin em like Jordan, setting new high scores for my Edward Snowden Mii. A deep grumble, *hey*. **I turn around and who do I see but Julian Casablancas.** I could have died at that moment, to even see the man, let alone find out what I was about to find. "This is Julian", says Maya. "He's my cousin, that means y'all are related." **No. Fucking. Way.** I giddy up with excitement, picking Julian's brain for the next 15 minutes. Apparently my parents never knew, since he was biological family but not in my step-family. When Out of the Blue, Maya tells me to grab my trunks. "What?" "We're hitting the pool, suit up." -Julian fucking Casablancas Maya had told me to pack my swim trunks for the trip. I go into my luggage, grab them, and we head to the local YMCA. I know, I know, this is all crazy. But apparently Julian had an accident on stage once that messed with his knee. He told us he's been working recently (I can't say with who ;) and hasn't had time to decompress. Why the Y, I have no clue. Soon enough, I'm swimming with Jules in a YMCA Olympic sized pool. Havin' a good time, I just don't want to stop at all. Suddenly, Julian let's out a lightly gorgeous shriek. "What is it?" "I can't swim down there!" replies Julian. "Not in the deep end?" We had been playing underwater Marco Rubio (Julian taught us, it's like Marco Polo but with your fingers) and Julian turned away from the 20ft end of the pool that I was in. I hear Julian ask Maya why he's instinctually worried about occupying that end of a body of water, yet I don't hear her response. "What'd you say Maya?" "Maya says I'm lacking in depth."</TEXT>

PTA is undoubtedly one of the best directors of our time, directing Daniel Day Lewis in *There Will Be Blood*, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Joaquin Phoenix, and Amy Adams in *The Master*. The man chooses his actors carefully, and Waterson was **perfect** in Inherent Vice. I don't think she's lucky, she's talented. Even the trailer for Alien: Covenant has me super excited, as I think she has more opportunity to outperform Noomi Rapace's *Prometheus* performance.</TEXT>

I love Frank Ocean just as much as I love Kanye West just as much as I love Julian Casablancas and just as much as I love Stefan Burnett. The first obviously hates Trump, the second apparently buddies with him, the third loving Bernie and the fourth a nihilistic non-human. The people who make music that change me earn my respect.

    <TEXT>Honestly yes. As a libertarian, I believe that individuals make the best decisions for themselves, and therefore government should only exist to protect individual rights. Applying this metric to regulation, I would much rather see public initiatives to protect people from dangerously misleading battery ratings that could result in injury, rather than a government that suppresses vaping and subsidizes big tobacco.

    <TEXT>While this is one extend of libertarianism that definitely presents itself en masse, I prefer to quantify the current level of "social good", the amount relevant to the conversation today, against the ideology of minimizing inefficiency and bureaucracy in government. For example, we totally need roads and emergency health services. There's no way our society today could, as it stands, benefit in any major way relative to the harms presented by cutting such socially important programs. I apply this to Consumer Protection laws, which do a very good job of minimizing and catching instances of fraud targeted towards consumers. The extent of freedom you propose is most definitely the ideal- a society where people could function purely off individual desires to the point where we all recognized the social good enough to not fuck with each other, therefore not needing the level of government that exists today. A self-governing collection of goodwill individuals bound not by law, but by an unspoken or unilaterally considered "good" social contract. This ideal is drastically different to the pragmatic reality we face. People do fuck with each other, and government (should) exist(s) to protect the right to not be fucked. This is why funding initiatives to protect consumers from a huge variety of health, financial, and safety issues leads to a stronger modern society. To maintain our striving towards the ideal, we must recognize that balance is key- balancing application of the ideal to the necessities of reality leads to something better than the ideal itself.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think it will take the "future" direction from FPP and go Drag Queen. 2011:First came Phrazes, then came Angles. Phrazes held sounds dramatically different than any Strokes album before. Then Angles comes out. It's different than any previous Strokes record. Comedown Machine also went a different direction for the band, departing further from their original sound. 2017: First came Tyranny, then came LP 6. Tyranny went further than any Strokes or individual solo effort before it. An almost completely unique and new sound unexplored by any contemporary artists. With FPP, the "future" Drag Queen sounded almost like The Strokes doing a Voidz song. This is our biggest glimpse to, literally, the future. And if the past shows anything (threat of joy, which could've come fron ITI, ROF, or even FIOE), it's that the present (oblivius, which sounds uniquely tied to comedown machine) is just a transition period. LP6 will be very, very unique. That's the only speculation I believe is safe to make.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Which is why oftentimes I find myself thinking his work is unpolished. While Gran Torino truly was fantastic, all of his other films have seemed to pander for a specific Hollywood genre-formula where the shots seem more "paid" than artistic, and the plot follows convention rather than creativity.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Jesus Christ it's not even an issue. Film is art, filmmakers pick whoever the fuck they want for the roles they feel will be well suited for whoever auditions. Just because a celebrity makes a comment on something in an interview, and that comment becomes the interview's hyper-sensationalized headline, doesn't mean it's a real issue that a lot of people care about!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I love the film because it presents incredibly interesting questions to the audience, and with a subtle ambiguity, doesn't answer those questions fully. To me, it explores existentialism with some incredibly well-articulated visual finnesse, and was very good at evoking my emotions upon release, notably towards David, the film's Android crew member played so impeccably by Michael Fassbender that I consider him a highlight of science fiction characters.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I tend to suspend disbelief for most films, specifically looking at the results of character's actions rather than the motivation for the actions themselves. To me, many of the questionable decisions the characters take *could be* explained by the split-second decision making they make in such a setting (alien planet, completely new life forms, lack of credible expectations, subversion from other crew members like David and Vickers, etc)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Quick lil post to get things moving today. What Strokes lyrics didn't mean a lot to you until over time? For me, it's "you trained me not to love, after you taught me what it was". I was in a relationship when I had first heard it, and was still head over heels for this thottie. But once we broke up, I realized the meaningfulness of this lyric on a deeply personal level, it's something I agree with and now recognize an individual parallel with to my life. So what lyrics stood out to you over time and became meaningful after personal experience?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ever since my ego death experience, one I found eerily similar to how you described it, my life has never been the same. It's like my entire life I've been building this house, all my experiences and thoughts created that first house. Once I had ego death though, the house was burned down. All I had were some of the memories of building that house, rebuilding it with a memory of the original blueprint and going from there. My new house is so different, you wouldn't know it was the same architect who built both. Scary, yes. Did I experience deep mental issues as a result of my times with LSD? Absolutely. It has now, however, been a year since I had my mind shattered, and just like MGMT said, I'm still recovering the pieces of what made it out okay.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I saw Julian Casablancas at a grocery store in New York yesterday. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn #8217;t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything. He said,  #8220;Oh, like you #8217;re doing now? #8221; I was taken aback, and all I could say was  #8220;Huh? #8221; but he kept cutting me off and going  #8220;huh? huh? huh? #8221; and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying. The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like  #8220;Sir, you need to pay for those first. #8221; At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter. When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually  #8220;to prevent any electrical infetterence, #8221; and then turned around and winked at me. I don #8217;t even think that #8217;s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Slime Season 3. I was in your boat, Channel Orange stan who's homies got into thugger when I went away to a different school. They sent me back on my fall break with an appreciation from singles like Best Friend, With That, Power, and even I Know There's Gonna Be (Good Times). But nothing prepared me for the sliming of which I was about to endure. Rage, rage against the slime. And rage I did. Slime Season 3 truly changed my outlook on music. Before, I had been able to overcome stigma and enjoy trap music, ie the less musical hip hop in which aesthetic overrides artistic quality. To me, that was the Chief Kiefs, the Waka Flockas, the people who I knew just cranked out the same stuff for fame. No biggie, I respect the hustle, and at this point in my life I'm more than happy to hear singles like that at parties, but never seriously analyzed anything from the genre the same way I did with music that I really respected. After enjoying the exposure to Thug's face-value through those few singles, I looked at Slime Season 3 like I would any other album. And it blew me away. Every song is a jewel, something to offer from this small basket of food left overnight as snacks from our beloved Thugger. A large bowl of Doritos, a heart glass of mountain dew. Or kush and lean, whatever, Thugger paints vivid pictures here, manipulating his voice tastefully to produce such a unique emotional and artistic instrument. He really, really is the best of his genre, making the best music with deeper meaning than many, if not most, of his counterparts. I highly recommend slime season 3, preferably with a blunt in hand and bitch ass to munch on.</TEXT>

Maybe there's different types of success, because I would claim Drive to be a successful movie, but I would also consider The Dark Knight to be a successful movie. One did well at the box office, but both are still regarded quite positively. Lucy will not be remembered rather positively, it is not a special action movie. Taken is notably more exciting, engaging, memorable, and realistic than Lucy, Luc Besson has way better movies than this marketed throwaway.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You say you do drugs that make you proactive now. This is nice, and can be good training wheels, but eventually you have to come to terms with the fact that you'll be happiest and most successful by riding the bike, living life being ok with sobriety. It just sounds like you've experienced some pretty serious drug abuse, beginning at a young age. Psychologically, it may not seem negative to be using drugs for productivity instead of escapism, but trust me, relying on those substances will eventually fuel within you more depression than you could possibly imagine.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'll use the example of fruit flavored ejuice, since that's exclusively what my experience with this situation entails. I have found that undoubtedly, investing in nicer juice has lead to a better vape experience. As aforementioned, I like fruity flavored ejuice. I've tried tons of them, and typically whenever I visited my local vape shop, the juice I would choose was dependent on both how I think it tasted and how much it cost. I would try to save money by buying large amounts of cheaper juice. I did this until I tried a flavor from a premium juice company, Naked 100. I was immediately hooked. Their flavors were not only better crafted, more pronounced, and cleaner, but the nicotine I got from their 3mg felt better than the nicotine I got from cheaper 3mg options. And it gunked my coils significantly less! I personally found what worked for me, and I do recommend the naked 100 line to anyone who is a fan at all of fruit or menthol vape juice. I saw the extra $5/bottle went towards a better experience, where I had better tasting juice, harder hitting juice, and cleaner juice that lasted longer.</TEXT>

If you're on amphetamines, reduce your dose and focus on eating more and treating your body with respect. If you're doing a lot of benzos, read a guide on how to taper down. Edit: so I just checked your profile you've been doing speed for the last 7 months? Yes you are close to a psychotic break, and are probably not the same person you were 7 months ago.

    <TITLE>Nitrous + LSD</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-08-30 05:30:08</DATE>
    <TEXT>Wanted to type this last night but got so fucked up from the Nitrous that I had to sleep and reflect some more to be able to verbally quantify my experience. So yesterday I did 50ug of LSD. I've done 40+ chemicals at low to absurdly high doses, so 50ug is nothing for me. What I really did the acid for was to be able to try the fabled Nitrous + LSD combo. Now I've broken through on DMT, and I've had the 4th plateau DXM trip. Haven't K-holed, but god damn do 3 whippits and half a tab of acid get you higher than the vertical limit of the universe. I didn't smoke during the trip, something that made the experience notably more positive and clear headed, and I opted to do the nitrous slightly after my peak. I get home and my roommates and their friends are over, some tripping some sober, so I whip out the nitrous and we get cracking. First whippit was just one cannister of nitrous, and holy FUCK was it a headrush. I also saw a geometric field of fractals that penetrated everything and itself, which dissipated to smaller fractals after a few seconds. Second whippit was two cannisters of nitrous, and god DAMN was this shit visual. My head felt like it was whatever gets hit in those "test your strength" machines, exhaling the whippit was like someone striking their hammer so hard and making the thing in the middle shoot up to the top, ringing the bell, and coming back down but continuing to bounce from bottom to top for 30 seconds. Poorly phrased description, yes, just imagine throwing a bouncy ball SUPER hard into the ground and watching it bounce rapidly from roof to floor of wherever it was thrown, that's what I felt like. Now the THREE NITROUS whippit was probably the highest I've ever been. I only got through half the balloon before visual effects kicked in. By the time I finished and exhaled, it was quite literally like I had accelerated above and outside the vertical limit of the universe, only to immediately shoot right back down into my body, continuously bouncing between fractal hyperspace and heroin-like body euphoria. I can't describe what three hits of nitrous on LSD is like, aside from comparing it to a DMT breakthrough, of which I have experienced twice. TLDR: Nitrous on LSD made me the highest I've ever been and rather positively influences the experience and personal meaning of my trip.</TEXT>

For a small box mod, the quality form factor and build quality are multiple levels above the Alien. The battery life is also great, and I can fit any atomizer on it with no overhang and it's still very pocketable.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Interstellar I think is the major example of a science fiction film in recent memory that also had a very large budget, and long runtime (slightly less than BR2049). The two key differences between the films are their accessibility and their marketing. Interstellar is a standalone property from a widely renowned director. Blade Runner 2049 is a sequel to a classic by a known but not household-name director, thereby making it less accessible. The marketing for Intestellar *did* show notably more of the film, it's plot, and it's characters than BR, which did a fantastic job of largely keeping it's characters' and plot's meaning hidden. This can get audiences invested in a film before it's release, whereas with a film like BR2049, the experience of the film being a "good" one comes from experiencing the events that our characters experience with the same amount of knowledge that they have. With Intestellar, at least audiences knew the basic threads of their story going into the movie. Not many people nowadays are willing to go to a film and experience it fresh, on it's own merits.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think this is a good time to discuss what a "good" drug channel looks like. PsychedSubstance is not meant for drug education, it is entertainment. This guy has done all sorts of crazy and unsafe shit on his channel, and yes, making mistakes is simply a part of life- a part of everyone's life. But, repeatedly has his channel given bad advice, glorified certain drugs (specifically LSD and DMT) and not thoroughly expressing their harm potential, and even done dumb shit, like in an LSD vs Alcohol video showing that it's possible to drive on LSD and that it therefore is better. TheDrugClassroom, however, has always provided a balanced scientific perspective that's truly focused on educating anyone. Whereas PS seems to be entertainment for drug users, TDC is education for everyone. He clarifies the difference between the objective and subjective qualities of a large variety of substances, and can really give a better "crash course" on a drug than anything PS has ever made. And the funniest thing here is that PS and TDC did a video together once. About MDA. Watch the video, The differences between these two people could not be made more apparent, and I'm sure that anyone who watches that video won't be surprised that PsychedSubstance later OD'd on MDA.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think this "awakening process" you speak of is part of something larger than ego death, which is the colloquial path to enlightenment. My ego death experience is the one event that most fundamentally changed my life. Up until that point, I was this one person, the same since birth. I had grown and seen and experienced things, but was inside my body. When I finally had my ego death experience, I was tripping L and thought I was dying. I went to lay down, and from then something profound happened. I believe I had a deeply spiritual DMT-type experience that I am blocked from remembering, but I completely dissociated from any sense of self, existence, absolutely anything. I exited my body, and I feel now as though my soul is outside of it. My sense of self, memories, thought patterns and understandings completely dissolved, and I completely rebirthed. The best way to describe it is like I was building a house my whole life. My experiences and lessons left me able to build a house a certain way, and as I built and changed that house I grew and changed as a person. Ego death burned that house down, and I suddenly was nothing, until I remembered I've gotta build a house. I live in a new house now, I feel distinctly different from the person I was before ego death.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This may be unpopular, but I do believe that the success of Nightcrawler came from a great script and a stellar lead performance. I didn't think that film was directed very cleanly, and parts of it still seem sloppy to me. It's fantastic, but not by direction. I haven't seen this movie, but the general consensus is nowhere near as positive as it was with Nightcrawler. This to me, from what I'm extrapolating from these reviews, seems to be overdirecting. Like Gilroy wanted to recapture what was in his last film with partly better directing, but apparently poor writing. It's a shame, but this kind of validates to me that Nightcrawler was a fluke. I do greatly enjoy his brother's Michael Clayton.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I agree none are my favorite Travis or Quavo songs, but I like this project better than the other duo-rap projects this year. It's very consistent, I feel like I could bump any song in the whip or at a party and it would be fantastic. Nothing game changing from either artist, but definitely a standout trap project for 2017. **BETTER THAN MORE LIFE**</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Just got out from the 7pm thursday showing. I'm a huge PTA fan, and have been looking forward to this film since its announcement. I think the movie is different than anything else he's made, yet it retains the positive elements that he is known for. Everything in this movie is done *master*fully, but it really throws in its own uniqueness which is just frosting on the cake. I think from the chaos of Inherent Vice, Paul learned to harness that chaos to further evolve his characters to be so incredibly real. Yet again, like everything else PTA has given us, there's not a second of this movie that doesn't feel real.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TheVapeCritic He gets a lot of flak for helping design a vape and then making it his best reviewed vape, but at the end of the day it's the guy's opinions, his mostly accurate critiques that make him meaningful.

    <TEXT>Reddit in general is simply too much of an echo chamber. Whatever the general consensus is among most people in any given thread, maybe 4/5 of the top comments will be that one side's opinion. All the responses to those comments tend to just reinforce that one perspective. Very rarely will most discussions and debates on this website be anything but black and white- not enough people venture into the grey area, thinking individually and near the middle instead of "on a side" seems to be difficult.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I believe he sometimes let's his emotions at the time get in the way of him being able to accurately score something. For example, all 3 of these artists' second album releases were disappointing due to their first projects being so fantastic, that their second looks way worse by comparison. That's not to say that they're not horrible albums. Aside from Teenage Emotions, both Birds in the Trap Sing McKnight and Always Strive and Prosper were relatively successful albums. They may have not been as good as Rodeo or Trap Lord, but they're still decent at worst and don't deserve such low scores.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I would disagree, I think there is definitely the dangerous and tyrannical aspect to wanting to limit gun rights, but when the left says gun control is the answer, I believe that's the immediate emotional response to wanting to stop shootings from occurring. I don't believe it's a well thought out answer *at all*, and I think it would ultimately lead to more tyrannical rule of government, but I would say that most regular people on the left would like to curb gun violence as much as we do.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It definitely is one of my favorites. I've been listening to it a lot recently, the way Julian's voice floats over the dreamy, almost radiohead-esque guitar patterns is just wonderful. The Strokes could absolutely push toward a less-than-voidz experimental direction, because songs like this one show their range as a band in making songs that are both new sounding and still accessible.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2018-04-15 10:53:12</DATE>
    <TEXT>i have a feeling that this statue is important every visual in this video is symbolic at the beginning, somebody stomps an empty can in front of this statue it is the first visual that is not the imessage text, and aside from the end (which could really be talked about separately or after we hear the album), that is distinct and not associated with any specific track on the album this makes me believe it is the precursor, or largely summarizing sentence to what the album is, may be, or may be about is the statue itself simply symbolic, or is it possible that death grips chose this statue specifically? is the stomping of the can a symbolic tribute to this statue? does the identity of the statue mean anything? does this mean the album will embrace getting fucked up? is it a symbolic relinquishing of getting fucked up? if the statue is identifiable, does it have any ties to history or the occult? check sacramento</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's a rough draft but a fantastic one. It's sort of like the second half to a bigger song, similar to the second half of 90210 or Oh My Dis Side. I think Trav is just spitting over the actual production to an astroworld track, but finding his rhythm and flow while spitting fantastic bars at times and filler at other times. The video of him making Skyfall with Metro Boomin shows this technique- some of his ad-libbing stays in and is tweaked during production, and some of it gets replaced with better bars but with the same or a similar cadence.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Fantano controls the way I think about everything :( Everytime I'm out with friends, and we go to like a nice restaurant, I can't appreciate anything about the experience. They order steaks, and order me one too, because I'm completely catatonic. But the steak doesn't excite me. All I can think about are thicc vegan smoothies. That's the only food that I know fantano likes. They'll say "Man, that steak was 10/10!"- I only feel empty inside. "Kids See Ghosts is a real 10/10", I think to myself. Such a life is painful and shallow, but at least I know that all my opinions are valid not out of self-confidence, but of Melon-confidence.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>End of TWBB still astonishes me when I think about it. I know a lot of critics say it's the only point of the film that lost them, but I found it both hilarious and blood chilling, akin in a way to the feeling I get at the end of A Clockwork Orange. PTA definitely has plenty of Kubrick in him. The Master, Inherent Vice, and even the recent Phantom Thread have a lot of Stanley's ironic humor, with all the right visual notes and moments to create iconic imagery.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Fantano controls the way I think about everything :( Everytime I'm out with friends, and we go to like a nice restaurant, I can't appreciate anything about the experience. They order steaks, and order me one too, because I'm completely catatonic. But the steak doesn't excite me. All I can think about are thicc vegan smoothies. That's the only food that I know fantano likes. They'll say "Man, that steak was 10/10!"- I only feel empty inside. "Kids See Ghosts is a real 10/10", I think to myself. Such a life is painful and shallow, but at least I know that all my opinions are valid not out of self-confidence, but of Melon-confidence.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The last movie I saw in 3D was Blade Runner 2049, and it was because it was the latest showtime and the last one I could catch that day. Ended up being incredible. Felt even more immersed, and for my first time with that film, it being in 3D truly is a unique characteristic to my first viewing. This isn't common though. I worked at a theater in high school and saw plenty of movies in 3D for free. With Blade Runner, it was worth the extra penny. Frankly, with every 3D movie I saw in theaters from 2013 to 2017, the only one I can remember enjoying the 3D on was Blade Runner 2049.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Heard Kids and Electric Feel a lot in 6th grade, but I really got into them as a Sophomore or Freshman in HS. It was either when I got my permit or license, but it was also when I had my first job, so I was basically brand new to real life. Started listening to Oracular Spectacular and Is This It obsessively on the drives to work. Eventually got into Congratulations, and by sophomore or junior year, MGMT dropped during my drive to marching band practice. Low-key just hid in the back the whole night and listened to the album a few times over thru earbuds. Very fond memories of those first three albums, but my fondest MGMT memory has to be during my first shrooms trip. It was during July after I graduated in May, my friends and I all ate our dose of shrooms and I put Congratulations on my friend's home theater speakers. By the time the shrooms kicked in, Congratulations ended, but it was the perfect come up album, and it blessed the trip that ended up fundamentally changing my life moreso than any other single event.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2018-08-05 08:27:46</DATE>
    <TEXT>I saw Anthony Fantano at a grocery store yesterday. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn #8217;t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything. He said,  #8220;Oh, like you #8217;re doing now? #8221; I was taken aback, and all I could say was  #8220;Huh? #8221; but he kept cutting me off and going  #8220;huh? huh? huh? #8221; and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying. The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like  #8220;Sir, you need to pay for those first. #8221; At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter. When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually  #8220;to prevent any electrical infetterence, #8221; and then turned around and winked at me. I don #8217;t even think that #8217;s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2018-08-25 00:45:29</DATE>
    <TEXT>I was driving today listening to the same stuff I usually listen to when I remembered a post from r/hiphopheads about a new Blood Orange album. Decided to stream it mid-drive and wow! This album is so incredible! If you didn't know, Blood Orange is signed to Julian's Cult Records. They've collaborated in the past, including my favorite non-$2bill performance, which is Jules+The Voidz with Blood Orange in NYC playing a mashup of You Only Live Once and I'll Try Anything Once. After seeing that, I listened to a few of BO's albums, but none of them really clicked. This album clicked from the beginning. It channels so many different things- Frank Ocean in Blonde, a bit of Michael Jackson, a bit of Julian Casablancas. Definitely check out Blood Orange's "Negro Swan"</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I loved it, Kubrick kept it short enough to not be annoying but long enough to lend a sense of urgency. I covered my ears before the moment when Floyd and crew took a picture with the obelisk on the moon. My buddy sitting next to me hadn't seen the film and looked at me like I was crazy, but then he quickly understood why lol. One of the tensest moments of the film for me, in a theater setting, was when HAL shut off life support for the astronauts in cryosleep. Kubrick did so much with just images and edits, no dialogue, and created a very dark and tense moment that I truly felt, moreso than most films released today.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'll be honest, the first time I saw this movie was an 8am showing, which was super early. I remember feeling incredibly eager to see it, because it was to be the first PTA film I had seen in a theater. First watch through, it just clicked. I got it. I was in the haze, the film seduced me into that hazy and chaotic world, and it all made sense. PTA has a knack for this in the same way Kubrick did. Every film is an independent world, and Inherent Vice is one of Anderson's most alluring. I appreciate it just as much as I appreciate There Will Be Blood, The Master, and Phantom Thread. I think time will age it like wine, and it will be another picture that more people will begin to feel and can understand took a lot of planning, work, and love to make.</TEXT>
