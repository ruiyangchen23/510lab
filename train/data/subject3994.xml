    <TEXT>Thanks for the reply! Sorry if I wasn #8217;t clear, I #8217;m specifically looking for the feature in Photoshop Express (the mobile app). Adobe released an update to their Photoshop Express app a few days ago and this added feature was prominently listed as the second item on their list. So I feel a bit silly not being able to find it but hopefully someone can point me in the right direction! I would have expected it to be under the Eye Tool as you mentioned for PS Elements, but there #8217;s only 2 options there -  #8220;red eye #8221; and  #8220;pet eyes #8221;. I realize this functionality (and a whole lot more) are already available on the desktop and I know how it works, I just can #8217;t seem to find it on the app. When I #8217;m taking pictures with the kids/big groups on the phone it #8217;s just really useful to be able to quickly fix that one guy who closed his eyes</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So sorry, but you #8217;re wrong again! I really hope you #8217;re just trolling because if you really think this is a full scorpion then clearly you don #8217;t know what a full scorpion is. We both know you reposted to whore karma and well done for getting 1k for this. Again it #8217;s a funny video it #8217;s just in the wrong sub...  #8220;Every other comment #8221; : all the other comments you had to scroll through to find mine, all telling you this is not a full scorpion. Look it up, it #8217;s not that hard. Doubling down when you #8217;re wrong and calling someone a child doesn #8217;t make you right, you #8217;ll have to learn to make better arguments at some point. Or don #8217;t, because... trolls?

    <TEXT>Ok I finally had a quick look through your comments history and I have to conclude that you #8217;re just a troll because no one can be this bad at arguments. Well, that and all the downvotes and the outbreaks of random name calling when you can #8217;t make a coherent point I can #8217;t feed you forever so I guess I #8217;ll just stop here Anyways it #8217;s only Reddit, no hard feelings. Happy New Year mate!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ok I really didn #8217;t want to respond anymore but this is getting funny again. So one more just for you Your Reddit history is there for a reason - to show people how you behave online, and so they know what sort of person you are and what to expect when they interact with you. The downvotes you get gives me context, as well as the numerous posts calling people morons and children.  #8220;Troll Handbook #8221;? Page 17 sub section bla? What are you the grandmaster of trolls? How sad do you have to be to even come up with that? Look I don #8217;t know why you have so much hate in your life but I guess it #8217;s better that you vent it out at me here than irl. Try to go out once in a while!

I see a similar shaped graph (up, then down) every week on fpl discovery, why it's always shaped that way. How is the x axis ordered?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>!thanks it makes sense now! I was being an idiot and nothing thinking straight It was the far right side of the graph that confused me - so for an average Gameweek the score decreases as you move down the ranks, but on the far right the score snaps back up quite dramatically. I just realized that this is cumulative overall rank so the new players added for any particular gw with teams catered to that specific week would be on the right and tend to do better</TEXT>

    <TEXT>How are you getting 0.7 points per game for Firmino? I think you might be misinterpreting the stats - that's 0.47 *goals* per game and 0.23 *assists* per game. You can't just add those 2 up and call it 0.7 *points* per game It's 4 points per goal and 3 points per assist, which comes out to 2.57 points per game. This is already an expected value (not probabilities or percentages). Similarly Vardy comes out to 2.01 points per game. Over 3 games for Firmino and 4 games for Vardy the latter comes out slightly on top with an expected value of 8.04 points vs 7.71 for Firmino. On top of that to do it properly you could also look at the expected number of bonus points per goal/assist and include that as well</TEXT>

If I'm reading this correctly it comes out to: (total + totalX) * totalX / 8 You're basically giving a lot of weight to totalX which seems a bit arbitrary to me. The net effect is the ranking is pretty much the same as if you just ranked by totalX alone. It's a great table and I like the concept a lot.

    <TEXT>I disagree that it's just an audio-based form of communication. Its a form of communication based on encoding language as long and short signals and it's not restricted to one single medium (sound). Morse code is often transmitted through light signals There are many situations where audio communication is not possible. Just like when Jeremiah Denton, the Vietnam POW, was forced to make a propaganda video while he was captured. He could not express his true thoughts through words, but instead he was able to blink out the letters for T-O-R-T-U-R-E in Morse code to pass his message to the world. Morse code is and can be incredibly useful and we are limiting what we can do with it if we restrict it to a single medium, whether it's audio, visual, or otherwise</TEXT>

You may not care about what happens to Canadians but the repercussions don't just end there. - US companies relocating will have to pay to build new facilities and have machinery relocated - if the tariffs really do materialize and hurt Canada they will likely respond with tariffs on US products, which will hurt US manufacturing and cost US workers their jobs This is why trade wars are never easy or good... it may sound like a "win" on the surface but once you look into it deeper it's a lose-lose situation</TEXT>

It held up ok, but it certainly wasn't the strongest bridge in the class Then just before it was time to test the bridges one kid threw a massive weight on our bridge and it collapsed. We were speechless, but after getting over the shock we said fuck it and just layered all the broken panels together to form a flat bridge. Super ugly with no structure whatsoever, but it was thick af. And we ended up winning the damn thing I wish there was a lesson there but I don't know what it is</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Wow that was one of the last comments I'd expect to get downvoted on, in /r/lego of all places! Honestly a bit confused though, I thought it was generally accepted that TLJ was a bad movie? That both surprised and bothered me (way more than I'd care to admit) so I googled around to see whether there's another angle to this that I never considered. I didn't like the movie because I thought it was just terrible story-telling, not because the cast was male/female/droid/Asian/black - as a person of color I think *that* would be a terrible reason to like/dislike a movie. That said I'm looking forward to JJ Abrams coming back to take the helm and wrapping up the trilogy on a high note</TEXT>

Not taking sides - this sub is about HK so anything that's not directly relevant to HK (whether it's posts about the UK, mainland China-specific news, or Trump tweets) should really not be posted here... I'm sure there's a /r/China or /r/UK others can subscribe to for that info. Other subs tend to have much stricter rules about what is/isn't relevant so I don't see why we can't do the same here while keeping things civil.

But that's besides the point, let's not get sidetracked. His claim that Germany gets 60-70% of their energy from Russia is simply incorrect.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I wasn't aware of this so thank you for spending the time to write this up. It's refreshing to have a factual/civil discussion for a change You're right, it sounds like my previous number was too low as I was just thinking about natural gas. However, it's still well below the 60-70% level that he quoted. Let's think about it from a top down approach for a second. Given that Germany gets 30% of its power from renewable sources, unless they import 100% of their non-renewable fuels from Russia his 60-70% figure is still grossly overstated. [source: this is from 2016 but is consistent with the 2017 data from other sources I've seen in the other comments] https://www.iea.org/media/countries/Germany.pdf Not saying that we can completely disregard Germany's increasing dependence on Russian energy as a potential concern, but the chronic misstatements are a distraction and does the whole situation a disservice. Instead of looking at the real issue the focus invariably falls to fact checking his sensationalistic yet incorrect statements.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I actually don't think it's that difficult of a transition - it's just a chat app so it's not like Facebook where there's an ecosystem for people to hang on to. Not saying it's going to suddenly happen overnight but the transition is actually a lot easier than with Facebook. If whatsapp really turns to shit more and more people will move to other apps. Chats are mostly 1on1 (ignore groups for now) so all it takes is for both of you to install a new chat app and you can pick up from the new app right where you left off. You can have multiple chat apps installed so in the interim you can use different chats with different people as users migrate away from whatsapp.</TEXT>

It's still doable but I would suggest downgrading the fifth mid from 5.0 to 4.5. Defense is a bit weak but you'll be playing 3-4-3 every week so it's Robertson and Ederson every week plus two of the four 4.0-4-5's 5.5 4 6 4.5 4.5 4.5 4.0 13 7.5 6.5 6.5 4.5 11 11 7</TEXT>
