    <TEXT>Thanks a lot. I toyed with ideas like utilitarianism but it led on to ideas such as it is OK to kill an animal or species if it provides more happiness than letting that animal live, is it ok for a sadist to kill his puppy? And the following consequences it would have on animal rights and environmentalism. Do you know if there is a philosophy that justifies environmentalism as I can #8217;t seem to find any.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Eh...not quite. They base their affinity to the Dark Side off of emotions such as hate, anger and aggression which in many cases means they lose control of themselves and are corrupted. I #8217;ve never heard of a Sith going into battle fuelled by happiness and tranquility. The Sith care for no one but themselves. That is why they seek to do horrendous acts, such as Anakin #8217;s murder of the younglings, to increase their power. The Sith Empire (Old Republic one) was based of enslavement of all to the Sith will. The Jedi are trained to avoid killing whenever possible.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>But their entire philosophy is predicated originally on helping and serving others. Sure, some Sith did look after loved ones, though I can #8217;t think of any examples of Plagueis actually do my that, but they still commit abominable acts, he himself manipulated Palpatine into slaughtering his entire family on their pleasure barge. The Sith have no use of emotions or qualities such as empathy, and while the Jedi are more detached they still try to honour those qualities.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks. I consider myself a libertarian socialist but this is one thing that bugged me. I have only one small point to your third paragraph. While I agree that the primary function of the state is to protect private property rights, surely it could also be enforced by private security firms, as anarcho-capitalists often espouse? Coca Cola has been known to hire death squads to kill trade union leaders and organisers is say Columbia, this being without state aid, so isn #8217;t it possible, especially given control of media apparatus, that they can maintain control without the state. And what if, even given Revolution, they remain entrenched in some areas, or foreign powers intervene, such as in the Russian Civil War or even the Spanish Civil War, in this scenario, which seems relatively likely, I can see the point of Marxist-Leninists who espouse using the state apparatus against capitalism. Also, could you explain how a judicial system would work, and ensure impartiality, rather than just mob justice. Also how would effectively solving crimes work? I understand you wouldn #8217;t have many of the crimes you have today, but what about for ones like rape, murder, abuse, etc...it seems an anarchist society would naturally lack a coercive body like the police, but this also gets rid of their expertise and resources when it comes to enforcing justice like in above said crimes, rather than simply protecting the system, and they do both. Lastly, I imagine the laws of an area are decided via direct democracy, but what if a certain area didn #8217;t saw make laws against domestic abuse? Where could the victim go, I know those sort of supposes the hierarchy at home, but it #8217;s unlikely these behaviours will go away overnight, if at all. Would there be a central constitution, which forbids certain aggressive or oppressive acts?( which kind of runs counter to free association etc...). These are my main dilemmas about anarchism.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>But what if the workers don #8217;t unanimously seize the MoP? You seem to be assuming that all the workers have been enlightened but that seems unrealistic at the present. They likely wouldn #8217;t be unanimous, both due to fear and due to remaining indoctrination for the capitalist system, as we can see with the majority of the working class supporting capitalism. Corporations have large cash reserves, and will no doubt be able to finance hit squads and well armed private security forces, and there will be people who are willing or are brainwashed enough to follow their lead, even fighting against their own class. And how do your propose taking down the state in the first place? A prime example is anarchist Spain. The working class did not unanimously revolt, and in the fascist parts, continued to work for the capitalists, albeit in many cases involuntarily but the point is they still fuelled the war effort the the suppression of the revolution. Foreign powers came in and supported the fascists, until the anarchists were driven back. Surely you need the coordinating and production capabilities of the state to fight such overwhelming forces, and the full production capability of capitalism against you. I can #8217;t help fearing that an anarchist revolution as you described would follow the same fate as Spain. The flip side is that even by the end of the war, Stalinist intervention had began to strangle the anarchist revolution, suppressing and killing its adherents in favour of authoritarianism. Here lies my dilemma, Marxist Leninism, will potentially leading to a successful revolution, simply ends up trading one oppressor of the working class for another (statist bureaucrats), but an anarchist revolution seems to easily toppled by the multitude of forces that are in opposition to it, ranging from fascist governments to foreign imperialists to capitalists. Any corrections or suggestions are welcome.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Surely the idea that a white supremacist society would no longer be anarchism is a fairly void point. The point is to try to prevent said white supremacy and oppression from happening. How is it helpful to an oppressed person of colour living in an anarchist-turned-white-supremacist society that it isn #8217;t _really_ an anarchist society, it doesn #8217;t change the basic fact that they #8217;re oppressed. This is presuming that it gets past consensus, but if so, what then? You say that society would reject it and overthrow said oppression but said commune voted for it! Also about rapists/murderers: getting exiled for rape is not necessary a deterring punishment, let alone rehabilitating. If they so desire, they could go from town to town raping people. Please explain if I #8217;ve any misconceptions, this is just my personal take.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks for the reply, you #8217;ve helped a great deal. It my question about consensus decision making is that it looks for the greatest possible majority correct, not necessarily unanimity. Also couldn #8217;t this be potentially efficient. It doesn #8217;t seem so far fetched from tyranny if the minority, in the sense that one person could hold up and throw out a decision that would greatly benefit most everyone. Say the commune tries to ban unsustainable fishing or agricultural methods, yet the lone fisherman denies it, or  #8220;violently disagrees #8221; and refuses to back down, what then? If one person can be overcome, then what happens if it is a large minority of the commune that supports these unsustainable and detrimental practices. Would there be a central constitution to prohibit decisions for say, child marriage? And if the fascists seize power in a commune, do the surrounding communes attack it, assuming that those left can #8217;t overthrow them? What if a commune largely goes of the grid, and then assumes oppressive power, yet other communes are unaware, it seems there isn #8217;t something to explicitly prevent this.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Great thanks a lot for this answer, it makes a lot of sense. However, as I understand it federations of communes and syndicate often coordinate production, and hence choose what to make. Seeing as it #8217;s recallable delegates, not direct democracy, do they decide based on surveys done on members of the federation? I suppose one could use a form of online voting or survey filling, which would better help coordinate production along people #8217;s wants and needs. Personally, I don #8217;t see many anarchists talking about the tremendously beneficial impact that technology and the internet could have on direct democracy and production decisions.

    <TEXT>I #8217;m reading Kropotkin #8217;s Conquest of Bread and he frequently mentions how people will do several hours of manual labour and then spend the rest of their day with their passions. Will one be obligated to work say 3 hours in a factory? I assume that it isn #8217;t literally to provide for oneself and to solely produce your own goods, but rather to contribute to the communal production plan. Does it have to be manual labour, or can it be rendering services, i.e. hairdresser? Or in anarchism is it just that one contributes according to how the feel, i.e. they know there is a demand for a certain good, say a guitar, and thus then go the factory for several hours a day and produce it voluntarily and spontaneously. I #8217;m not entirely sure how work is coordinated under anarchism, happy to read any links explaining this.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Most of the anarcho-capitalist questions are based off of a debate with an ancap acquaintance, and what lead to go from left wing statism to anarchism, though of course I #8217;m still learning. I #8217;m loosely acquainted with mutualism though but largely reject markets. My main problem with anarchism/anarcho-communism is that due to there being no government (which I support), a community can just as easily choose not to engage in mutual aid and thus not provide for the poor or elderly or ill. It #8217;s premised on people voluntarily giving to these groups, and while many use an example of a  #8220;communal barn #8221; for basic goods, there is nothing making someone put their produce here and thus distribute it in this way.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ah ok. Would this be done through direct democracy? Consensus can lead to dissenting views basically being bullied out and can make it difficult to address complex decisions, as well as reverting to the base intellectual denominator, which satisfies everyone and no-one. But then direct democracy seems like it could just turn into tyranny of the majority. Also for worker #8217;s councils, are those just unions that you voluntarily join because you like that kind of work, i.e. you used to be a builder and thus choose to remain one post revolution and utilise your skills? I ask this because it seems that you wouldn #8217;t have a fixed or specific job or workplace under anarcho-communism, thus how can you join a union for it, if there are no fixed workers?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Interesting, I broadly agree though I #8217;m still not sure how to tackle the  #8216;tyranny of the majority #8217;. In understand it would be less likely when it #8217;s face to face and on the neighbourhood level, but surely it could still happen, at least in a few communes. Should they restore hierarchical relations, do fellow communes come in and dismantle them. This is were I sympathise more with Bookchin, as it seems in Libertarian Muncipalism there is more of a safeguard against hierarchy and environmental degradation, which doesn #8217;t exist as much in anarchism/anarcho-communism.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ok not so sure about how  #8216;federations #8217; are so different from governments. You still cede power to (somewhat centralised) entities to make decisions for you, and delegates are not so different from representatives in bourgeois democracy, they may have instructions but they will at some point have to exercise they own view and make decisions for which they don #8217;t have specific instructions. I just fail to see why it #8217;s so different, and federations still surely have the power to make autonomous communes abide by their decisions, otherwise there would be little point in them. Furthermore, these federations presumably have jurisdiction over certain geographical areas, thus it #8217;s not entirely free association. How are these structures different from a state?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That makes much more sense. However, I do have one question, and that is how syndicates/worker #8217;s councils work. While reading the Conquest of Bread, it seems to suggest that one will not have a fixed workplace and can work as they wish, although I suppose it would be in accordance with a communal plan, but in this scenario, there are no fixed worker #8217;s for an industry, thus how can you have syndicates? As you can see I may have a few misconceptions about anarchism, and my knowledge has mainly stemmed from this sub and online sources, are there any good sources that you #8217;d recommend that explain it all clearly?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>How does this actually translate in practice. I suppose that communes and syndicates voluntarily join federations, but presumably there is only one for a specific group. i.e. one cobbler #8217;s federation. Given this, and their need for other resources which they can #8217;t produce, surely they don #8217;t have too much choice about joining these federations? Also, can they choose to disregard a certain decision from the federation that a commune or syndicate disagrees with, and within a commune, how are the policies agreed within the assembly enforced? I understand that one would try to reach a consensus, and that you #8217;d likely joint a commune you agree with, hence less disagreement, but what if you refuse to abide by a certain commune resolution? Surely you won #8217;t be violently coerced? Assuming reasoning with the person didn #8217;t work, would they impose material sanctions of the person, or banish them from the commune? Surely this is using coercion in the capitalist sense of material deprivation, and if not, how can one get the commune decisions to be followed, and if they aren #8217;t, what is the point of them as policy-setters?</TEXT>

Where are your sources for the bases in USSR soil, not doubting just wondering. The USSR was not really in position to fight at 1939, and needed to rebuild their army after the purges, and things like the invasion of Poland were originally designed so that the Polish Government could flee behind Soviet lines in event of invasion. I fail to see why they #8217;d suddenly change tact and become lovey-funny with the people they knew desires their destruction. It was not an alliance, but rather a Non Aggression Pact is the sort that many Western Powers already had with the Nazis.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I should probably clarify, I know that the purges were largely dismissals and being fired but I wanted to know the extent to which the Western claim that millions died is true, or how many people died from political repression in the USSR. I know the government sources claim around 750,000 death sentences handed out (and yes not all of them were carried out), but I wanted to know the extent to what people agreed to this figure. So here we have US sources claim tens of millions died and then Soviet sources claiming it was a few hundred thousand, more if we take the Holodomor into account. Are there any sources which analyse both these claims?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Great will definitely check up on it. Although I do have a question: many first hand sources from the USSR seem to portray fairly widespread purges going deep into society, yet Soviet figures talk of only around 800,000 death sentences (I know that is still a very large amount but is far less than typical figures or the tens of millions narrative). What would you say is the reason for this disparity? Were certain sentences and repressions omitted? Or are these two scenarios not mutually exclusive?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I feel some people have been giving unsatisfactory answers which may have given you some misconceptions, but note that this is just my opinion in the subject. First of all, as others have pointed out, Chomsky isn #8217;t widely considered anarchist within the movement and as such should be taken with a pinch of salt. Most believe that there is no  #8216;legitimate #8217; authority or proof that they an give that would somehow make them worth obeying, and even if there were, I doubt good results would be one of them. If a thief stole your money and made rules for you to obey on pain of his thugs beating you up, but spent most of your money on buying you a tasty cookie, or baking you a pie, does that legitimise the theft or his rule over you? I #8217;d like to point out that you are coming at this from a pretty utilitarian standpoint that most anarchists reject. The criteria for something being acceptable is not what good it does but is it coercive. In simplification, what right do you have to force me to do something according to your will, of no volition if my own, or to demand the fruits of my own labour? We point out that society is merely a collection of individuals, not some separate being, and it makes no sense to be forced to live one #8217;s life not in search of our own goals and happiness but rather some pretend ones of some vague idea of  #8216;society #8217;, why should our purpose in this life be simply to serve this body? Our fundamental beliefs is that coercion, in the sense of forcefully making someone follow your will, is unjustifiable and unnecessary, and that society should organise along the principles of voluntary association, direct democracy and mutual aid. Furthermore, in the Nordic model of government, the people do not rule themselves. They do no make their own decisions, but rather have them dictated to them by higher powers, which obviously comes into conflict with their own desires (otherwise the use of threat of force would not be necessary), it doesn #8217;t matter if I choose my dictator as I am still fundamentally unfree. If your concern is that under ana anarchist society these services would not be fulfilled, or that they couldn #8217;t be without the use of hierarchy then I definitely disagree. In an anarchist society, workplaces are self-managed, meaning that the doctors, nurses, etc...would all get a say and decide how they desire to run the hospital. In this way I would suggest that hospitals would actually be better run and produce better results, as the people who best know it #8217;s problems and the realities of the task would be in a position to change these faults, as opposed to having these needs stalled or halted due to a lack of desire among management to tackle it. In concert with patient cooperatives or communes, which advocate on behalf of the patients and give input, medical services would be able to be much more responsive to the patients needs. It #8217;s also a firm belief that the present education system is damaging and oppressive towards children, though that is another debate. Suffice to say that in anarchism these services would be organised alongside the principles of freedom and free development of children, and so that they have control and input over their own education instead of having it indoctrinated and forced into them do that they an make good worker #8217;s for the capitalists one day. For examples, I would urge you to look at the [ #8216;Escuelas Modernas #8217;](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escuela_Moderna), or [this essay](https://wesjones.com/gatto1.htm) which sums up our position perfectly on modern schools and is a great read. Even to look at real world example, during the Spanish revolution, the doctors collectivised and the maintained a large network of hospitals, clinics, etc.., all free and without need of some external hierarchy or force making them do so, and in fact coordinated the creation of several new heath centres in the countryside to help out the peasants who previously had been without this access. Looking at the comments, you often seem to accuse people of the Nirvana fallacy, and that we are letting the perfect be the enemy of the good. The first thing I #8217;d like the say is that, in accordance with my first paragraph, we don #8217;t believe that the present situation is good, and that instead it is premised on the coercion of free individuals against their will, as well as the exploitation of the workers and the appropriation of their surplus value by the capitalists or the state. It #8217;s a ridiculous belief that the state, an entity that is founded in oppression, can create anarchy or that it will remove hierarchy, or that it would simply dismantle itself, and even if it could, you can #8217;t have a self organising and free society imposed on a people, rather it must be grasped by the people themselves. Furthermore, while the state may have subsidiary functions, its primary purpose is the preservation of the capitalist system of domination and exploitation via the protection of private property, the mechanism that supports of said domination and exploitation (not to be confused with personal property, which is founded on use rights, namely that if I live in house I am using it and so manage and  #8216;own #8217; it, as opposed to me owning some far away field and then forcing people who use (who do so because they need to to not starve) to give up a large part of itthe product if their labour, despite me contributing nothing to the production of any crops). This being said, anarchists are not  #8216;opposed #8217; to the state providing free healthcare and those services or stand in its way, and to provide an example in slavery, it #8217;s not that we oppose mandating that slaves have better working conditions or a minimum age that they can work, but rather that we view these as reforms of an evil system which keeps the fundamental evils in place, and our true goal is the abolition of slavery, which is what we work towards. Once radicals start focusing on what you advocate they inevitably become side tracked and radical ideas tempered, and get diverted from the real goal of human emancipation. Sorry if this was too long and I hope it helped, happy to discuss and disagreements or misunderstandings with this.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I assume that you mean in the form or serial killers or rapists? It #8217;s in doubt true that some people are murderous and destructive by nature, and that in an anarchist society, despite the absence or suppressive hierarchy, or of poverty creating those conditions, that there will be a few bad apples. These people will show up in any society regardless of the system, but aren #8217;t necessarily harmful, if offered therapy and supported in childhood, the majority of psychopaths and sociopaths don #8217;t go on murdering sprees and aren #8217;t a problem for people, whereas under our current system due to stigma about mental health and material (monetary) barriers to accessing it, from the cost itself to the fact that employers will be less likely to higher you, all this contributes to people who already have issuesi becoming worse, and subsequently harming people. However, despite this I still accept that there will be people who kill others anyway, for no particular reason other than they enjoy it, or rape and sexually abuse others. In this event the community would likely keep a watchful eye, and due to greater interaction would probably notice that people were going missing and take action, instead of waiting for a police authority to do so. In many cases, people know that someone is dodgy or could be dangerous, it when they tell the police their complaints are ignored. They do nothing as not only would it be illegal to act but also because they have been taught it isn #8217;t their role their entire lives. There is also no problem with a group of detectives coming together or even working alone to investigate crimes and I imagine that communities or their confederations would elect or randomly select individuals such as forensic specialists for specific cases, or even some form of policing force, more like a neighbourhood watch, which could be on call if you are in danger. In a society of anarchism individuals I believe that the stigma about rape, which cases many women not to come forward would be gone, allowing the perpetrator to be dealt with and to protect others from the same experience. Now once a the perpetrator has been apprehended what happens is fundamentally down to the community. I am assuming that this is a person so psychologically damaged that there is no chance of rehabilitation or amendments, as are advocated in most other situations. In this case the response among anarchists vary, some may advocate banishment but in our current society that is simply shrugging the problem off onto someone else so in reality I imagine this would translate to something more like internment, or a very different form of prison, in which these people would be separated from society, and I imagine would be largely self sufficient as not many people would want to labour to support these felons. There is however a minority among anarchists that support the death penalty for this small minority (of both criminals and society) in which there is no scenario that they can be free and not pose a threat to people, as they don #8217;t see why society should have to support such people. In summary though, even supposing all of this turns out not to be true, and this small minority of criminals, which are a small minority in and of themselves. Even in this unlikely scenario is it worth keeping humanity enslaved to an institution which itself depends on violence to function, is it worth subjecting ourselves to the whims of an elite high will then control our lives how they see fit, is that worth it compared with the infinitesimally small amount of deaths that may result from this likewise small minority of individuals?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I may have phrased that badly. The main goal of the state, _in this society_, is the preservation and protection of private property and thus capitalism. In a state socialist society this may be different, though ultimately it will still create a disconnected elite which dominates and controls people #8217;s lives and appropriate their surplus value in the same sense as the capitalist does, as happened in the USSR and other revolutions founded along state socialist principles. Democratic socialists propose utilising the state to create socialism, and even though I would find the end result undesirable as well, I doubt they would be successful in doing so, this being for several reasons. The first is campaigning requires vast amounts of money to win, and generally those with more money (and so an interest in preserving the status quo) win and are subsequently controlled by lobbyists and those on on whom their campaign donations and thus reelection #8217;s depend. This is also reflected in the media, in which the overwhelming amount of opinion is pro-capitalist, simply due to the private nature of it, as they depend on advertisers for revenue, and thus are restricted largely to their interests (which are overwhelmingly of bourgeois nature), not to mention that it requires large amounts of capital/wealth to create said corporation and make it so that it has a base large enough to create an impact, and so the great majority of news sources are from the perspective and interests of a wealthy elite. The wealthy also have a network of think tanks specifically for the purpose of churning out propaganda and reasons for the elite to keep their power, which also give flak to nay news source or journalists that steps too far out of line. Even should this somehow be overcome and a socialist party is elected to power, there are two more obstacles. The first is bureaucracy, which is unelected an thus unaccountable to the people. It is primarily recruited, at least for major positions of power, from those with wealthy and educated backgrounds, and I doubt many socialist would pass the screening tests, though there is also the fact that being unelected it is generally unresponsive and unreflective of the people #8217;s opinions in general, and through this a certain world view tends to be reflected. These then take actions such as give misleading or biased information towards the elected representatives, pressuring them towards a specific viewpoint or if the party is radical enough can resort to their ultimate weapon: the coup. No democratic socialist nations which have passed the first barrier have not fallen to a coup, examples by Augustus Pinochet #8217;s overthrowing of the democratically elected Allende from power in Chile, and his subsequent 20 years of fascist dictatorship. This also happened in Spain in the 1930s and is what caused the Spanish Civil War, when the army revolted and joined the side of the bourgeois against the left wing coalition in power, eventually replacing it with a fascist dictatorship ruled by General Franco. There were also planned coups in the terms of Franklin D. Roosevelt in the US and Harold Wilson in the U.K., neither of whom were even particularly left wing but were felt to pose a threat to those in power, luckily both were discovered and put down before they could be attempted. The second, and one of the most important, is the power of capital (wealth-ish, but also includes control over the means of production, such as factories or farms). Given that in our present society, control over the Means of Production. (MoP) are restricted to the hands of an elite few, they then have control over the economy and thus our lives, and following this can bend politicians to their will by actions such as withholding investment or destroying produce (no politician wants to be known as the one that destroyed the economy and created unemployment), or in the extreme capital could simply threaten to leave the country and relocate elsewhere if its demands aren #8217;t met. Examples of this are routine, but for an example in (democratic/) socialist nations we can look at Venezuela or the early USSR. In the former companies have often been caught destroying thousands of tonnes of grain or killing baby chickens so as to create artificial scarcity and shortages and anger directed at the government, or in the USSR the kulaks, which were in effect agricultural landlords/wealthy peasants, killed their livestock and burned their crops in order to stop the workers collectivising the farm. It is through these barriers that the capitalist (propertied) class retains control over government and stops genuine change and reform from happening, and retain control of the government as a tool for oppression of the non-propertied classes (those who must work to survive). I may have sidetracked a bit but now to get to your belief about capitalism. Our objections to capitalism (though I #8217;d like to see how you define capitalism as we may not be talking about exactly the same thing for the purpose of this debate I will definite it as _an economic system founded private property (defined and discussed below) as well as the predominance of wage labour) is that not that capitalists and bosses are mean to workers or don #8217;t pay them as much as they should but rather that the entire economic system is founded upon exploitation and subordination. To delve into this we must first examine property. Anti-capitalists make the distinction between private property and personal property. Private property generally allows one to own just about anything, be it and idea, melody or an entire mountain, it only exists through the enforcement of state-sanctioned violence and has only existed in its modern form for around 250 years. This contrasts with personal possession, the right to which stems from whether a resource or space is being used or occupied or being set aside for later use. To use examples, if I own a patch of land and I farm potatoes with it then it is my personal possession and I manage it, and can tell someone to get off and stop treading on my potatoes however I do not ha the right that should I allows another person to farm this small patch of land I am using, I can #8217;t demand the produce of his labour and thus exploit him of the surplus labour/produce that he creates, when I have contributed nothing to the making of these potatoes, and so have no right to them, and have merely taken advantage of the fact he has no land of his own to farm thus is coerced into accepting my exploitation of his labour and my rule over what he does on pain of starvation and death. According to anarchist principles, if I were to accept his farming of the land I could either leave and allow said person to farm it and do as they wish or I could farm it cooperatively with him as equals, as opposed as master and slave. This is the fundamental source of capitalist profits, I may work 10 hours and produce  #163;100 worth of potatoes, but my boss owns that produce and may take  #163;50 worth of my produce for himself, despite not contributing in production, and that value he has just stolen from me is profit. Yes, capitalism creates many horrible side effects, such as the continuous boom and bust cycle (which can #8217;t be reformed away contrary to what many social democrats think, as it is intrinsic to capitalism), the fact I work hours of essentially unpaid labour due to my boss appropriating my surplus produce, the exploitation of the environment in its infinite expansion due to its quest for profit, or that it forces workers into dangerous working and living conditions, or that it fails to supply basic needs (if I have more profit in satisfying an elite #8217;s passing whim than feeding a child then I will do so), all of which are a function of power in a society over production decisions and conditions being in the hands of a few, which is essential to capitalism and this disempowerment and lack of control over our lives can #8217;t be reformed away, any less than the fundamental exploitation at its heart can be, sure, some of its effects can be lessened, but the fundamental problems and reposts will never disappear, all you are doing is softening the boot that is trampling on you. Sure I may get some nice choice between which soda drink I would like to buy, but that is the ironic thing about capitalism, I have choices in trivial things that matters little and no choice in large questions, such as how I want to live my life, or what I want my workplace or community to look like, or whether I can live my life without being exploited of a large part of my labour, be it in the form of capitalists, banks in the form of loans and interests or by landlords. I am happy to go over the economic organisation and advantages of anarcho-communism (though you should note that it isn #8217;t the only strain of anarchist thought), and why I believe that it will produce better material and moral results, but it isn #8217;t very relevant to this particular discussion.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ok so your main concern in this is that anarchism would essentially just revert back to its previous authoritarian roots? This could evidently be a real problem, and the main thing I can suggest is that it relies on a widespread and ingrained culture of liberty and anarchy, instilled throughout their life to respect these values. Something many people say is that Anarchy is a process, not an end result, and by this mean that anarchists will have to be on constant guard against the reemergence of hierarchy and authoritarian domination in our lives. It will be a constant struggle, and in part it relies on an armed population willing to defend their freedom against any encroachment on it by hierarchy, be it in the imposition of state or capitalism, or the reemergence of racism and sexist gender roles, I imagine that if anarchists saw their neighbouring community or commune falling to hierarchy they would go over and lend a hand in smashing it, as a threat to one is a threat to all. I #8217;d hope that within an anarchist society, having tasted true freedom people would be unwilling to reinstate a system of work where they a large part if not a majority of what they produce is stolen from them and where they are subject to the whims and tyranny of an individual, but I personally imagine they will be much more of a risk of the reemergence of the state than capitalism or capitalist private property, and the tactics above, in tandem with whatever the individual community decides to do, while be necessary to combat it. But I am obliged to point out that this threat is not just constrained to anarchism, but rather all economic systems in general, just as much in social/liberal democracy as in anarchism. What happens if an intelligent and charismatic figure in liberal democracy rises to power and creates a fascist or otherwise totalitarian dictatorship, as has happened in the past and continues to this day? Just like in a totalitarian system, what if the people choose to overthrow the system? If people no longer choose to live within such a system, then they won #8217;t, and it will change unless you have some incredibly centralised, totalitarian 1984-esque system. I am not a utopian socialist, and acknowledge that some communes may fall and relapse into hierarchical tendencies, but anarchism is a constant constant fight against this, and as you yourself said, don #8217;t let the perfect be the enemy of the good.</TEXT>

It almost always ends up along agricultural levels at best, and completely collapses in the majority of cases throughout history, which is then used as propaganda by the state and capitalism as to why our ideas can #8217;t work. I see your point about not provoking a response, but ultimately the above fa tors will do more to defeat a revolution surely.</TEXT>

Of course people can organise into healthy and self directed communities but unless you are an Anprim running into the woods isn #8217;t a very good place to start. I suppose I would imagine a mass movement more along the lines of a general strike or even what happened in Anarchist Spain, AFAIK only individualists and mutualists support creating it in the current system, and even then prominent figures like Tucker went back on that and began advocating revolution.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ok, you are right to point out that as of yet my position has probably come across as fundamentally coercive, and I acknowledge I #8217;m wrong about that; however, my main problem is that you seem to advocate these separate communes as a way to show and convince others of the benefits of anarchism, yet is it not that they will be comparing an industrialised capitalism with an anarchism on such a small scale that it will produce little, perhaps other than farm it own food. How is that a model for convincing others of its merits? It simply paints anarchists as a bunch of primitivists, as opposed to people with serious goals for society. The only real way to showcase the success of our ideas would be to have it within a current industrial society, as that is the only way of comparison, and obviously people anarchism to capitalism and if they see it as small squatter settlements its not going to entice them to change. Anarchists have been trying your ideas for decades if not centuries and as someone who was recently a SocDem (the legacy probably showed in my previous answers, though I acknowledge I was wrong in those) I can assure you that those examples do next to nothing to convince people, rather examples in large societies such as Spain do bring people in.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That #8217;s true, and while you may personally disagree and have systemic critiques of capitalism and the state, unlike Voluntaryists, you would prevent someone from say engaging in capitalism or hierarchy, which in reality translates to the same effect as Voluntaryism. I disagree with the source, as IMO it contradicts itself, claiming that any system under an anti authoritarian banner should be recognised, yet social anarchists try too much to create a set morality to conform to, but the fact is that this set morality is antiauthoritarianism, and yes social anarchists wouldn #8217;t to,erase hierarchy p, which they believe would re-emerge from individualist anarchists and egoism, but this is not some authoritarian domination but the prevention of it!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This isn #8217;t socialism. It #8217;s purely an American fantasy that social democracies, which maintain capitalist private property, wage labour and production for exchange as opposed to need (though not a central feature of capitalism). Stop this ridiculous idea that socialism is when the government does stuff. The means of production are privately owned, (and I don #8217;t consider state ownership worker ownership, like in the USSR, but regardless, European countries don #8217;t have that either). Not to sound aggressive but it seems that you aren #8217;t familiar with what socialism actually advocates and the theory behind it, but rather are distorted by US distortions. Free healthcare is not socialism, nor is a welfare state, they aren #8217;t socialist measures, merely ones designed to brighten capitalism, not smash it. I could go into ways that social democracy is better than the US system, but it #8217;s not really relevant to my beliefs as a communist, but again I #8217;d just like to reiterate that social democracy, what those countries have, is nothing at all like communism.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Vietnam...Afghanistan (for Soviets and Americans)...? Warfare is becoming less conventional these days, you no longer have two countries fighting each other at the front lines. It #8217;s guerulla warfare, and for that one does not need the same mass mobilisation and coordination of people and arms that the state produces. Some people make it appear as if as soon as an anarchist revolution happens the West will march in, but remember that the West needs to make itself appear as the good guys, so it #8217;s as much a propaganda war as anything, and that #8217;s what did it for Vietnam. Even for conventional warfare, militias organised within the communities that federate together is plausible, as is the production of arms and vehicles of war. If the populace refuses to host the invaders, there is little they can do.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; No anarchist revolution has lasted longer than 4 years. We've had socialist revolutions last 70+. Every time anarchism has been tried it's failed horribly, degenerating into a bandit filled dictatorship with a dictator who loves to rape women on mass (ukraine) or in the case of Catalonia, labor camps, losing the only war you ever fought because your army has no discipline and is among the worst in the world. But yea, find someone to blame it on and keep trying. Post was by u/Comrade_Belinski, one of the mods.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>What are you talking about? It was lost when the soviets began witch hunts against anarchists, began screwing over supply lines and effectively destroyed the revolution. As you know, there was still a government in power in Spain which took over for most of the war (and got rubbished, completely screwing up attacks like Huesca), and not offering aid to Basque regions. You are simply spouting classic Republican propaganda against the militias. The communists were largely in control of this government. And as even those in the US communist party who visited remarked, the communists were the most conservative and moderate party in the arena, with their declared aim to be to reestablish bourgeois democracy and re-enslave the the working class, which had finally got a taste of freedom. So much so that even American outlets such as the New York Times wrote articles defending them! The Stalinists did as much as anyone in Spain to destroy the revolution, stop spouting their propaganda, simply because the proletariat didn #8217;t immediately submit themselves to a central government and its tyranny.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have the opposite view of this. There is no such thing as  #8216;society #8217;. It is a social construct, and is merely a term for a collection of individuals who have associated together. It is not some separate body to serve and appease and benefit, rather there is you, an individual, which obviously exists because you have the experience of it in yourself. I know I exist, and I feel consciousness and the sense of being an individual, I don #8217;t have the sense of being part of some higher amalgamation of consciousness that grants my individuality, rather I only have my own experience, and can associate together as one wishes with other individuals for mutual gain, or other principles you choose to hold. But it #8217;s a ridiculous concept to declare that I somehow have some duty to this made up body called society.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No. While you are shaped by your environment, that in no way lessons the fact that you are an individual, and have a direct sense of separate consciousness to everyone else. I don #8217;t know what you are feeling, I can guess, but I don #8217;t k is how it is to be you. It makes no sense then that there is this entity called the  #8216;collective #8217; which is an amalgamation of separate individuals. You may interact and their together, but you are still individuals. What does this mean  #8216;almost #8217; identify themselves? They either can it they can #8217;t. And regardless this doesn #8217;t necessarily prove anything that isn #8217;t obvious. Sure, I know what I am partially through comparison with fellow individuals, and humans grow via copying this around them, but that contributes nothing to this idea if there being some construct called society that is desperate from the individuals that I am intrinsically part of, almost like a hive mind. Sure, I don #8217;t deny that we are intrinsically social animals, and can have shared reactions. But that doesn #8217;t mean that I now serve some view of the  #8216;collective will #8217; which in reality is just the ideas of a group of individuals, and isn #8217;t some sacred thing to which I must devote my life and serve. We are still fundamentally individuals, and why we may associate together for mutual gain (and have evolved to do this due to its evolutionary advantages), that in no way diminishes our uniqueness, from which we derive the idea that an individual shouldn #8217;t be bound to the will of one, or a group of, others, as it robs us of what essentially defines us. If you don #8217;t accept this then I #8217;m not really sure why you #8217;re an anarchist.</TEXT>

I #8217;ll admit some of this comes from the documentary  #8216;Cuba and the Cameraman #8217;, which is just a guy and his camera, so should be relatively reliable.

    <TEXT>I realise I #8217;m answering this a little late but this is just silly. The first thing that I should point out is that the PKK is a self-described Marxist Leninist Party, the same group you are defending, so perhaps your criticism should be more internally directed. Secondly, the two prisons you just listed are in Turkey, and have nothing to do with Rojava! Honestly,do you even talking about? Again, if you have a problem with the HDP having a rep in NATO, direct it at yourself, as it is an ML party. What bullshit is this that the YPG, The units created to defend the Democratic Federation of Northern Syria, are created by imperialism? It is a genuine social revolution, not some CIA plant as you seem to espouse. What do you think their logic is eh?  #8216;Oh yeah, let #8217;s orchestrate a libertarian socialist revolution, that #8217;ll really show those commies and please the capitalist class! #8217;, no, and it #8217;s stupid to suggest so. The US funded Rojava in fighting ISIS when their interests coincided, again like them funding the USSR against Nazi Germany (which you never responded to). Not to mention that faced with Turkish imperialism, the US has thrown the DFNS under the bus. Btfo with your ill informed rubbish.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Capitalism is the predominance of the system of wage labour, which is a function of private property, not markets. In this sense, modern capitalism has only really existed for the past 250 years, as opposed to having been part of human society for several thousand years. People exchanging goods is not capitalism, capitalism is a specific social relationship.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ok. So what is wage labour? Wage labour is when you are payed a portion of what you produce and the owner of they Means of Production takes a significant portion of it for themselves because they  #8216;own #8217; the MoP, not because they #8217;ve actually taken part in any productive process. Here is a scenario: I need to eat to survive, so I work on a ploy of land which someone else owns and grow apples. I produce  #163;100 worth of apples, yet the person who owns the land, despite neither rising it not taking part in the production of the apples, takes  #163;50 if my labour, in effect robbing me of it because the state (or a private company) has promised to defend his ownership of that land with violence, regardless of whether he uses it. This is an exploitative relationship and the owner of the private property (distinct from personal property, which is things you actually use. You may own a car, but not the car factory) leaches off of your labour. This wage labour and the social relationship that is inherent to it, and the private property (of the Means of Production) that makes it possible, is what defines capitalism, not simple exchange.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ok, in my example, which was boiled down for obvious reasons, by producing the apples I had generally assumed that included the other aspects of production, i.e. you had planted, tended and pruned the plant as well. I should point out, for the vast majority of businesses, the scenery you painted isn #8217;t how it works. The shareholders don #8217;t fertilise the field, nor does the manager. They simply extract the products of labour from the workers that actually do the work. Now, in the real world of course you are going to be coordinating and working the land with fellow workers in order to maximise the fruits for mutual gain, I don #8217;t see how that is specifically relevant to capitalism. The scenario you listed was one of cooperation, not the relationship of domination resultant from property. In communism, I would work the land as an equal with my fellow worker. Clearly we all use the land, we do different jobs, but we all partake in production, and there for we clearly have the right to collective control over it, in the sense of direct democracy and self-management in the workplace. I #8217;d also suggest that because it is generally impossible to determine exactly how much someone has contributed to production, as all production is social, therefore the products of collective labour should be held in common, i.e. in communistic fashion. What happens in capitalism (and this is accepting your premise of the capitalist (owner of the MoP) working), is that the capitalist despite not partaking in production or only to an extent, has complete control of the goods produced, the conditions they are produced in, ect...he is, in effect, a dictator within his business. The issue is not the someone possesses land in itself, but rather they possess land which they don #8217;t use. We don #8217;t have a problem with someone owning their small farmstead, but when someone owns the entire forest, this preventing people from living there or using it unless they agree to be exploited and ruled over by him, and is thus mutually exclusive with freedom and autonomy, both over yourself and the things your produce. A world without property rights is not one without possession. If I use an apartment, I can stop other people from coming in and damaging it. What I can #8217;t do is own an apartment via absentee ownership and rent it out, as I #8217;m not using it then, someone else is. Likewise if I get a flat mate, we have joint use of it. It merely decrees that you can #8217;t own something that other people use or set aside for use. I can own my vegetable garden, but if I let someone on a ploy of land and then they grow the vegetables, then I don #8217;t have a right to them.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ok, AnCaps have a habit of finding their way into this subreddit, so let #8217;s make some things clear. Anarchy is about more than just government, it is about dismantling all hierarchies within our society, and capitalism is an incredibly hierarchical system. We are not AnCaps, and we are anarchists for different reasons, which transcend your belief in private property, as ultimately it is contradictory to freedom and autonomy. There is a reason that the earliest AnCaps explicitly rejected the term anarchist because they recognised that what they proposed was utterly at odds with the principles of anarchy. Capitalism is based on the theft of the labour of the proletariat by the owners of the means of production, and your version of private property forces them into relationships of domination and oppression, hence we reject your system. If you want to, answer questions on your own AnCap101, but please don #8217;t come to this sub, you literally only exist to confuse people trying to learn more about the principles of anarchism.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well, not sure at this point if you just don #8217;t understand our definitions or if you #8217;re just denying reality. Firstly it #8217;s stupid to suggest in the modern economy that everyone can own their MoP, only around 4% of the population is self-employed, so it clearly isn #8217;t an option for the vast majority, and generally it requires capital to attain. Regardless, even if it were possible, there would still be the vast majority of the population that is being exploited of their surplus value. I don #8217;t understand what you mean when you deny that happens (mostly because you just flat out denied it without any supporting argument). Let #8217;s give an example, I starve if I don #8217;t sell my labour to someone who owns a means of production, so I must, and I get permission to go into someone #8217;s land and grow an apple tree and produce ten apples, which I pick. I have produced  #163;100 in worth of apples in 100 hours, which are solely the product of my labour, my labour being the productive and transformative asset. Yet despite only me partaking in production, the capitalist then comes and takes  #163;50 worth of my apples, not for any work he actually did, he may have been subbing himself on his porch for all it matters, but simply because the state protects his ownership of this land he isn #8217;t using with violence. He repeats this with other people, and so lives without doing any productive work, simply by taking the fruits of another person #8217;s labour. There is the obvious distinction between private property and possession, and that is use. In the above example, it is the worker who is actually using the land and therefore should have possessive rights over it, yet the capitalist has private property of the land meaning he owns it without using it. It is stupid to suggest this isn #8217;t a distinction, as the latter allows for exploitation and places the worker at the mercy of his master, a supreme dictator who has complete power over him, and as such is incompatible with any free society.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is a silly argument.

But that in no way excuses those actions. In the present day, the US is the global hegemony and commits many if these atrocities, and 150 years ago it would #8217;ve been Britain or France that we criticised. The fact that others brutally subjugate people says nothing on whether or not it #8217;s ok to do so. If a bully comes along and beats up the weak kid, it is neither here nor there whether other people capable of beating him up have done so, what matters is that in the here and now, that bully is beating up and abusing the weak kid and as such we have a duty to call him out on it and stop him. Right now, The US is the bully. Yes, Mandela doesn #8217;t have a perfect history, but few people who actually accomplish things do. He was fighting an entrenched and extremely racist regime, and in some cases you must become the enemy to destroy them.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don #8217;t think you read to the end of the Wikipedia page. While yes, it was originally meant as achieving socialism through bourgeois democratic means, that changed in the 50s and there was a large split, and it denounced socialism and advocated a mixed economy which maintains private property, wage labour and markets, but with government intervention to promote social justice. In effect keeping the boot stomping on us in place, but making it slightly less painful. Regardless it isn #8217;t socialist, and social democrats would never describe themselves as genuine socialists, and its aims and theory is completely different.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Erm...not sure if you know what the Marxist use of the word class is, or if you are talking about simple differences in income. For us, class is a relation to the Means of Production, not something to do with your level of income. Here is something that I wrote elsewhere explaining what we mean by class and exploitation.  gt; But what is particularly exploitative about capitalism? To answer this, we must look at what forms the basis of this system, namely private property. Contrary to how many capitalist apologists try to portray it, what makes capitalism distinct as a socioeconomic system is not market exchange, but rather private property and the things that stem from it. Under capitalism, the means of production are to a large degree monopolised under the control of a single class, that being the capitalist class. This creates a class of people, the proletariat or  #8216;working class #8217; who possess nothing to sell to survive except their labour power, namely their ability to be productive and make things, and in doing so create value. This means that the majority of a society are driven to work for capitalist, to seek employment from him, on pain of starvation. This is the scenario of which workers in a present system are faced, but how does this create exploitation?  gt;Due to the capitalist #8217;s control over the means of production, and hence the worker #8217;s livelihood, he has the power to control and regiment them, but even more importantly, to appropriate the products of their labour. The worker produces their goods through the expenditure of their labour, and yet the employer, solely by virtue of ownership, which is granted to him by the state and backed with the threat of violence (how private property is enforced), receives total control over his workers #8217; produce, taking a significant portion of it to sustain and enrich himself, or to put it another way, to amass capital (from which derives the name capitalism). To envision this theft clearly, let #8217;s look at an example. Suppose that I am a worker, who despite there being abundant unused land to work on, am excluded form it by threat of violence (I will be beaten up or forcibly kidnapped by the police force should I attempt to), and in the extreme, by death, should I attempt to work it, because a capitalist claims it as his own, again despite not using it. To survive, as I must, I agree (in the loosest possible sense, as in reality this situation is no better than if a gun were pointed at my head), to work for one of the landowners and grow apples. I work day in, day out, to grow the trees and ensure that they are healthy (in reality this is partaken by multiple workers, but for the purposes of the example I will keep it at only one), and when the time comes, I pick them and transport them to the market. They sell, and I find out I have produced  #163;1000 worth of apples in 100 hours of work, and yet my employer, despite doing nothing for the production of the apples, and who could have been in another country for all it mattered, takes up to  #163;700 for himself. He has robbed me of that which my labour alone produced, and in effect I did 70 hours of unpayed labour, from which derives the term  #8216;wage slavery #8217;, because we devote a significant portion, if not the majority of our time at work, not producing for ourselves or our family, or even the needs of our community, but rather simply to support the parasitic entity that is the employer, and it is this appropriation of the workers #8217; labour that is called profit Tl;dr, there are no lower, upper or middle classes, which are merely arbitrary divisons of income, but rather class is about your ownership of property and your subsequent ability to leach off of the work that others produce. The capitalist class does not produce, it merely leaches off of the produce of the worker. You can #8217;t prevent exploitation of domination of worker #8217;s under capitalism because it is intrinsic and indivisible to it. The employer would always have control over the work putting them in an unfree situation which is exclusive to freedom and autonomy, and the system exists off of stealing the products of the workers #8217; labour. I #8217;d also argue against the idea that  #8216;collective welfare #8217; is something to strive towards at the expense of autonomy, but that #8217;s another question.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>How does one achieve this merger? Sounds like what happens in most historical examples which is that fascism is capitalism in decline, when the capitalist class looses its faith in liberal democracy to preserve its property and so resorts to fascism to resolve the contradictions in capitalism. Regardless, in places like Francoist Spain, the merger results in rule by the capitalist, clerical and landowning aristocracy, naught to do with the workers. The state represents capital completely in this scenario. I also fail to see that if you care about the wellbeing of the working classes, why not collectivise the Means of Production, and eliminate the exploitation (which I assume you acknowledge) and domination that you want to use the state to prevent completely.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You specified them being subservient, you never said how. And frankly most of facist history goes to the contrary. You also haven #8217;t said why collectivise the workplaces by putting them into the hands of the workers isn #8217;t desirable. If the capitalists are in charge they may always subjugate the workers (though honestly they always do as my previous comments showed, they #8217;ll just do so more obviously), so why not let the workers control their means of production instead of being beholden to the capitalist, and control the products of their labour instead of having it stolen from them by him. Not to mention that I #8217;m not sure why you think the state has special authority to force people to do things, and to beat up, kidnap (arrest) and lock up people who never consented to be placed under its authority. If you justify the state, what is wrong with a criminal syndicate? Why is the general good the most desirable outcome, why should I be able to attack you because it benefits me and my friend?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There is no such thing as communal means of production per se. It makes no sense that if I go into the wilderness and use land it #8217;s mine for the period I use it and then suddenly stops being so when some more people move close to my geographical area. This idea completely conflicts with the autonomy and freedom and voluntary association that anarchy seeks to uphold. It is unlike capitalism because you can #8217;t create a monopoly on land, because there is only so much you can use. The land is mine for now and I am using it because only a limited amount of people can obviously use it, and at the present I am using it. You act anyway as if there is already a community, but the OP specified they were going alone into the wilderness and setting up their own farm, something other people haven #8217;t helped him with in building it and so he has no obligation to them. I got here first, so I had the best pick of the land. I am not a mutualist, but it is an anarchist tendency which allows for money and production for markets, and is anarchist because it excludes hierarchy and authority (whether it can maintain that #8217;s another question). If I make something with the product of my labour it is solely mine, communists, as I am, may advocate voluntarily pooling it and my surplus with other people, because I can #8217;t make everything, i.e. i leave my surplus food in the communal barn, x leaves their excess clothes and we take what we need, but what does not happen is that people band together and forcefully taken the products of other people #8217;s labour, especially when it is only by virtue of living within a certain magical line (geographical area). You seem to simply advocate a small scale state, which you #8217;ve yet to explain how it is compatible with anarchy and its ideals of voluntary association.</TEXT>

I disagree that there is only a certain point at which socialism can be achieved, and that as a result we must set a timetable upon our freedom. Socialism is a relationship to the means of production, specifically worker control, which is the essential aspect of freedom. Socialism and communism are not the same. That being said, I disagree with the assertion everything was  #8216;meant #8217; to be free, as if some god created it for us to all be happy communists.

    <TEXT>The point is that they are arbitrary and baseless. Why is it the state can threaten you with violence for some actions and it is morally ok, but these certain actions have an unjustifiable special status that is somehow immoral to break? It is ridiculous to support the state as legitimate and to support human rights. State violence is legitimate or it isn #8217;t (it isn #8217;t). Why have you arbitrarily appointed human suffering as the milestone? Does that mean we can ignore human rights if they don #8217;t help in that goal? I am not allowed to speak my mind or live with my family, or not be tortured if my doing so doesn #8217;t serve the interests of a group of people dominating others within a magical boundary (i.e. a state), then I can be tortured and forced to do things at gun point (as all laws ultimately necessitate) as they wish?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You #8217;re not getting this. You ignored my entire first paragraph and never answered why is ok for governments to enforce their will with violence.  gt; Because it is measurable and real, unlike "Evil" which is not. First of all, human suffering is not measurable. It is not a physical thing and we have no scale or data to detect the net human suffering of our magical land area and the violent state that lays claim to it you insist you supporting. Secondly, even if it was quantifiable, that fact alone does not make it some imperative to strive towards. In that case why not suggest that we strive towards providing doughnuts for everyone, which is quantifiable? What aspect does human suffering have that allows you to come up to me with a gun and demand I follow your orders (as a state does)? You have placed human suffering on a pedestal as a reason to violate my autonomy for no clear reason? Even assuming it was I doubt you are consistent with that belief. Are you in favour of giving equal treatment outside your country as inside? Where you build a free hospital at home, you will build one in the Congo? Human suffering is universal, and even worse in the Third World, so why would you confine your policies to your own country?  gt; Human rights are established by states so your question is inherently nonsensical. They may he enforced by states, but presumably you have a reason that you enforce them, i.e. you imagine them to have some objective good. Statists tend not to treat them simply like any other law, they place them on a higher scale of importance and declare a nation is wrong to abuse them. Again, for no particular reason as to why the state can beat someone up for this certain thing but not for that.  gt;And your second question is just bizarre. The purpose of a state is to secure rights. If it's a properly constructed state, the rights of everyone living in its jurisdiction, including you. This is just historical ignorance, thousands of years ago, people didn #8217;t give a fuck about human rights. The state arose to protect the property and power of a growing elite. Perhaps you believe the state exists to preserve rights, but that isn #8217;t its present purpose. I must also note that position is contradictory to being a social democrat. If you believed it solely existed to preserve  #8216;rights #8217; (presumably here you mean your arbitrary human rights), you would be a libertarian, as you imply the government #8217;s only job is to maintain the rights, in which case all the extra laws which SocDems support seem hard to justify. And who decided this jurisdiction? If I have a gun and claim that your house is now in my jurisdiction is it now morally right for me to force you to do what I want?  gt; And state's don't operate under pure utility that changes from instance to instance. They operate through laws, where laws are established if the people within a society believe that those laws will limit human suffering in some way. Disregarding the rosy eyed view of what actually drives the law making process, and what controls the government, namely the interests by and large of the capitalist class, but I am asking what is the basis of your morality? _Why_ can a state force me to do things at threat of violence? _Why_ is human suffering a driving factor? If you don #8217;t even support a utilitarian framework, what does drive you?</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; With the threat of violence in order to reduce violence. And it is that commitment to the reduction and minimization of violence which makes it acceptable. Don #8217;t pretend that the state simply reduces violence. The states purpose is vastly more than simple self-defence, which a state is not needed for. It is also ironic given the state is the largest wielder of violence in our society, and commits violence on a much larger and more systemic scale than anything else. And no, it is simply plain wrong to suggest even most of that violence is in the service of self-defence (reducing violence). I also don #8217;t know why you are pretending as if you advocate a night watchman state, which while still wrong, is more consistent with your reasoning than being a social democrat, which far extends simply reducing violence.  gt; Infant Mortality. Maternal Mortality. Unemployment. Poverty. Disease Rates. Mental Health. I could go on. Human suffering is absolutely measurable. I assume that you are talking about physical human suffering, which is a different measurement to this, and while these may convey a degree of human suffering, they are not measurements of it, nor can they be because human suffering is not a quantifiable thing.  gt; They are the social contract, essentially. I respect your property rights and you respect mine. As those foundational laws on which all other laws are built they are more important. Further, they exist to restrain states. States cannot operate unfettered. They exist to serve humanity, not vice versa. The problem with social contract theory is that it has no basis in reality. It harks on about some mythical  #8216;social contract #8217; which was supposedly agreed upon somehow some time ago, but makes no attempt at explaining why I should be bound by something that I didn #8217;t agree and consent to and which was made (and even here we are wrong because such an agreement never took place) by people long dead and who have no right to decide for me. It is an intellectually vapid thought exercise. Furthermore, other than asserting this mythical social contract, you have yet to give a reason as to why it is the way it is, and why we should choose it to be so. I never consented to your private property rights, they are forced upon me by violence. _Why_ should we enforce them. You keep evading this question. What justifies you using violence on me to do so? I also beg to differ that states can #8217;t operate unfettered, they have done for most of human history and many still do. And if that wasn #8217;t a historical claim, it seems a somewhat baseless moral one. Again, they do not exists to serve humanity, they were created to and and for the most part still do protect the power and wealth (property) of the elites in power. The state is what enforces modern private property norms and so ensures the power and wealth of the capitalist class, and ensures they can continue exploiting the proletariat.  gt; I didn't say "Human Rights" in our current conception did I? You had been previously talking about human rights so I assumed (wrongly) that you were. Of course if you use your somewhat vague and wide ranging definition of rights the yes, states exist to protect them. Not sure what you mean by just totalitarian states, modern liberal states exist to protect property rights as well.  gt;No, because you'd be violating our social contract which the state exists to enforce. I addressed the social contract myth earlier, and it seems that the social contract is whatever you are trying to justify at the time. But you seem to have completely missed the point of the example. In that example, I was the state. That was exactly what the state does, the state is no different from me in the example. And yet despite this, you give some metaphysical legitimacy to it, and are still yet to explain where that comes from, as it evidently doesn #8217;t come from my consent.  gt; Do you want to have a moral discussion or a discussion about states? Once again, I keep ignoring the question because it isn't relevant. How can you say it isn #8217;t relevant? The two debates are inseparable. We must have a moral discussion because we are discussing the moral legitimacy of the state and of your utilitarian views, which you have as of yet been unable to justify, only asserting them and thus building your argument off of faulty logic. We can #8217;t have a discussion if you refuse to explain and justify the fundamental assumptions your argument rests on.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>From the wikipedia page on etymology and terminology  gt;The word "anarchism" is composed from the word "anarchy" and the suffix -ism,[22] themselves derived respectively from the Greek  #7936; #957; #945; #961; #967; #943; #945;,[23] i.e. anarchy[24][25][26] (from  #7940; #957; #945; #961; #967; #959; #962;, anarchos, meaning "one without rulers";[27] from the privative prefix  #7936; #957;- (an-, i.e. "without") and  #7936; #961; #967; #972; #962;, archos, i.e. "leader", "ruler";[28] (cf. archon or  #7936; #961; #967; #942;, arkh #275;, i.e. "authority", "sovereignty", "realm", "magistracy")[29]) and the suffix - #953; #963; #956; #972; #962; or - #953; #963; #956; #945; (-ismos, -isma, from the verbal infinitive suffix - #943; #950; #949; #953; #957;, -izein).[30] The first known use of this word was in 1539.[31] Various factions within the French Revolution labelled opponents as anarchists (as Maximilien Robespierre did the H #233;bertists)[32] although few shared many views of later anarchists. There would be many revolutionaries of the early nineteenth century who contributed to the anarchist doctrines of the next generation, such as William Godwin and Wilhelm Weitling, but they did not use the word "anarchist" or "anarchism" in describing themselves or their beliefs.[33]  gt;The first political philosopher to call himself an anarchist was Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, marking the formal birth of anarchism in the mid-nineteenth century. At several points it does point out that archos and archon can both mean leader and authority, and you are wrong in trying to limit it to your convenient definition. It also explicitly states Proudhon was the first political philosopher to call himself anarchist. Anarchism as a philosophy explicitly meant opposition to hierarchy, not the state. It is doubtful whether capitalism is even voluntary hierarchy (especially since it has never come about without the aid of a state, but that is another argument.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It is used as a pejorative, not some deep analytical term. Many anarchists who use the term don #8217;t recognise the state anyway, so in a sense it is inly glorified private power. Even assuming it is a separate entity. The point is not that it is capitalism in the sense the capitalist class had control ever it, but rather the state has taken their role. You may claim it is a trust for the workers, but that doesn #8217;t change the fact that their relationship (that of separation) from the means of production haven #8217;t changed. In capitalism, the class is the private capitalist class, and classes are a relation to means of production. Those relations persist into vanguard socialism, the proletariat remains the proletariat, divorced from the MoP, and ownership if the MoP is transferred to the state, in effect making the state a distinct class if its own, even if individual bureaucrats are not. Again, it is a pejorative term which critiques class relations (which still exist) under vanguard socialism as being only a little bit different from what they are escaping, it is nit an attempt to label vanguard socialism as a type if capitalism.

I understand that the point of the vanguard state is to be a temporary transition to communism, but the fact if the matter is that the proletariat are divorced from the MoP in a manner _similar_ to capitalism, that is the critique.

The prime differences between fascism and Islam are that they centre around different things (and I should note there is such a thing as theocratic fascism), and if you take the fundamental teachings, as many Islamist countries do, the similarities become alarmingly apparent. Whereas the similarities that communism (I assume you mean socialism here as communism is stateless) and liberalism have are only superficial in that they utilise the state. Other than that the goals are different, which can #8217;t be said about radical Islam. Gtfo with labelling any critique as bigotry. Obviously I don #8217;t support harassing or targeting Muslims, and those who do should be challenged like any other fascist, but the ideology of Islam itself is a reactionary force which should be fought in the same manner as other reactionary ideologies. I dislike conservatism, I don #8217;t advocate targeting or harassing conservatives. I am not bigoted for disliking conservatism as an ideology, in the same vein I am not bigoted for disliking Islam as an ideology, as all countries in which it is in power tend to be reactionary and intolerant.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I agree this conversation has become exhausting which is why I haven #8217;t replied earlier. Evidently the foundation for your argument is social contract theory, so a rebuttal of social contract theory should suffice. To start off I will take the erroneous assumption that a social contract is even valid. Now I must ask, how is this social contract defined? There is no great get together where everyone decides what the social contract is, it is purely decided out of reach of the people by the state. Now we must get to why the state is illegitimate to do this. You #8217;re entire argument stems from the fact that I am allowed to leave and so by staying here I consent to the state. This is an absolutely ridiculous premise. Firstly, I should point out that to exists I must take up space, and so I have to reside somewhere, and the chances are that place is dominated by a state, and the few places that aren #8217;t are where the state collapsed in civil war. So in effect to exist I must subject myself to the whims of a state, and it makes no difference that I can choose which one, just as it doesn #8217;t matter that I can choose a tyrant if I still live in tyranny. This is also ignoring economic barriers to leaving, such as transport, necessary visas, ect... which all prevent people from upping and leaving. But even these arguments don #8217;t address the root of the problem, as even if all these were non-existant as problems the state would still be illegitimate. This is because the state has no logical right to authority over me. Statists bestow some magical quality on the state tat makes it different from other violent organisations, but fundamentally it is the same as any cartel. It simply lays claim to an area with violence. It is easier to show this with an analogy. We start of in a stateless setting, as humans themselves did. Me and you both live in a fertile valley, but one day me and my mates come up with our spears and decree that we are now the state and command you to obey our orders, and that we lay claim the the valley as our territory, laying some arbitrary and made up line in the ground as borders (as modern states do) and stating that they rule all within it. They also claim that because I still stay within those imaginary lines I am somehow consenting to their rule? But again I ask, what right do they presume to have authority over me? Why do they suddenly control that area of land? For no reason other than their violence do they do so and it is exactly the same for a state. I do not consent to a state by virtue of living in an area because said state is simply a gang of thugs and has no moral or logical claim to that area. They have no right to infringe on my human agency and so in effect deprive me of a vital part of my humanity. You have got to question yourself on why you give states this mythical right to control this land, unless you are suggesting that anyone who lays claim to a piece of land on whim now controls everyone and everything within it, in which case I may go over to my neighbour with a pump action shotgun and lay claim to his house as the state, and as he remains in  #8216;my #8217; borders he consents to my domination over him. This is obviously a ridiculous concept and yet it exactly what you are trying to justify.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Re-read this. I hope you realise how arrogant and narcissistic you sound. Idk wtf you are on about when you claim that while I may demolish on the other pillars are strong. We are literally going through each of your  #8216;pillars #8217; and as I point out the fallacies ad flawed logic in them you are retreating to others, but you hardly have other strong pillars to fall back on, and soon enough the roof will come collapsing down on you.  gt; Through our laws and our constitution. That is our social contract. And yes, we consent to it through elections, and through remaining in the United States. Do you ever stop to question your own arguments? According to this logic by virtue of existing I consent, which seems a pretty stupid and valid basis for consent if there is no physical way for me not to. This is the same as tyranny. First off, in elections I do not make the decisions governing my life myself, I elect some elite to forcibly take the power out of my hands and make decisions for me regardless of my opinion on them. Nor did I ever choose to be represented by this person. As pointed out previously, living in an area does not make one consent, so the fact that you mandate I choose a ruler to force laws on me, and beat me up for not complying, means nothing. If I vote according to you I am cons eating by participating, and if I don #8217;t apparently I consent by giving up my voice. Gtfo of here with trying to pretend I consent to this bullshit. If you come to my area and at gunpoint demand we choose a representative and that representative has beef with me so sends his glorified thugs, aka the police, to beat me up I am not consenting to that regardless of what your bullshit theory says.  gt; This is no concern of ours. The fact remains that we are not forcing you to remain here, and we have no responsibility to upend our entire way of life just because you disagree with it. We aren't forcing you to live here. It is because you are forcibly preventing me from leaving. If I attempt to leave you will stop me with violence because I haven #8217;t payed. So yes, you are violently preventing me from leaving and I am not free to leave.  gt; because that's exactly what *will* happen without a state. Someone will try to build one, and it is entirely possible that it will begin as tyranny. Surely you see how ridiculous you are being!? Your argument here is literally  #8216;a state is morally good because if we don #8217;t have a state then a state will emerge #8217;. First off, this just isn #8217;t true. On can have organised self-defense militias to fight against any wannabe state and its attempts to infringe on people #8217;s lives. Where they use violence we will fight them with violence. You also keep on pretending that you only advocate for a libertarian state, which you blatantly do not, and so these arguments can #8217;t justify what you advocate, and that is even if they were valid, which they aren #8217;t. We are talking about the moral righteousness of the state here, and so by defending the state you are supporting the people in my analogy, as those are in practice who the state are. You haven #8217;t given a reason as to why they are morally justified other than  #8216;if they don #8217;t beat you up someone else will #8217;.  gt; No, that violates our social contract (laws) and if you were indeed another state, by taking the property of one of our citizens, you'd be engaging in an act of war and we're within our rights to stop you. Huff. Ok, look, I explicitly said this is in a stateless environment, and so there is none of your  #8216;social contract #8217; which you have admitted has no independent moral justification and so isn #8217;t relevant here, especially given the fact it isn #8217;t even a real thing. This analogy is to demonstrate the righteousness of states, in that example I represent the first state, I am not violating a social contract. You are claiming in that example that what I am doing is morally legitimate, and yet continue to refuse to give a reason as to _why_ it is, only going on about how it violates the rights of another state which already lays claim to this individual, completely missing the point of the analogy.  gt; Legitimate states, while their origins may lie in conquest, derive their powers from the consent of the governed. And the monopoly of force we describe does not exist to maintain power, but to prevent force from being used in human affairs. I have literally shown how the consent of the governed has absolutely fuck all to do with it, and that there is no such consent at all. Stop repeating this lie unless you have some new arguments that actually make sense to back it up. And again, *stop pretending that you are only arguing for a libertarian state* , you state you are a social democrat, and as such advocate a much wider range of government action than simply preventing violence, a function which can be done without a state anyway with organised volunteer militias. This argument does not justify any of the stuff that you no doubt advocate as a SocDem so stop stating it as if it does. And again, this still doesn #8217;t justify your authority over me. Just because someone threatens someone else doesn #8217;t give you the right to barge into my home and commandeer my money at gunpoint (tax) in order to prevent it. We may band together in a volunteer self-defense militia to defend against it and assure the natural rights and agency of our fellow human being, but we can #8217;t be coerced into doing so at gunpoint.  gt; As I have stated multiple times. Repeating erroneous arguments doesn #8217;t make them true.</TEXT>

They must be in concert, not one or the other  gt; Now the real question is, why do you oppose the people being in control of themselves?

    <TEXT>I propose in the same way that people should organise horizontally in communes with direct democracy and federation of communes. However these communes are not created by some arbitrary decision of people deciding that at everything within this invisible line is subject to our jurisdiction, but rather people voluntarily associate together and agree to share resources communistically and work to solve common problems and achieve mutual interests (and I reckon for practical reasons people will associate locally, but it is nonetheless voluntary and doesn #8217;t have to be this way). It is like joining an organisation, as opposed to being told you are in said organisation because you are within said determined border. If someone doesn #8217;t wish to join, they can live outside the commune, and potentially trade for what they need, or really whatever arrangements they happen to make with their neighbours. This way I am not subject to the whims of others simply by virtue of existing and taking up space.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That #8217;s silly. The fact that there are no morals does *allow* me to create my own set, but the fact remains that they are still made up and have no validity. The question is why should I choose nor to farm animals, with moral reasons out of the equation it becomes much less clear cut, and clearly the vegan crusaders who brigade everyone telling them to kill themselves and that they are despicable human beings have no actual argument. Suffering and pain may be real, and I may, as an irrational being, react against it due to empathy, but all that might lead me to do is provide animals with a good quality of life and not be cruel to them during it, frankly it creates no obligation for me to not kill them, only to do so in a relatively painless fashion. Yet more baseless moralising from vegans telling others they aren #8217;t worthy of life.

    <TEXT>There #8217;s a pretty good quote from Stirner about this but can #8217;t find it. It goes along the lines that a moral man can never understand an amoral one will always confuse their actions with immorality. It #8217;s not, it is simply the fact that there is nothing  #8216;bad #8217; about as much as you might moralise it. Furthermore an animal #8217;s sentience and a human being #8217;s agency are two different things and as such I will treat them differently. One can feel pain, and that is about all the fact it is relevant for, but a human has its own agency and critical perception of reality, and as such I treat my fellow human differently than that of an animal. Also why would I kill said random person, empathy aside, it seems your moral compulsion (perhaps he #8217;s a meat eater or a farmer?) would lead you to abuse and kill him more so than someone who isn #8217;t driven by these made up ideals that are external to and above me. Regardless, your purposefully avoid explaining exactly why what you assert is immoral is so, and are only concerned with insults and attacks, so you clearly aren #8217;t willing to hear any other argument.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; Suffering is bad, therefore there is something bad about it. Ok, so you #8217;ve made the assertion that suffering is bad, now back it up. Why is it bad? This seems pretty consistent with you, you make baseless moral claims and assert certain things are bad without explaining why they are. I #8217;ll save you the effort and point it is impossible, because while to justify yourself you need to explain why said assumption is bad/good, you will need to rely on on another assumption to do so, and so you just go down a rabbit hole of assumptions, never being able to reach one that justifies your case, because there is no predetermined objective morality (there could only be if there was a God to do so, which seems another baseless assumption given God #8217;s unprovable nature) which you need to tie your case to in order to justify it. It is literally impossible to have morality, that is the cold, harsh truth. Simply continue to ask yourself *why* to your answers instead of deliberately trying to reach your desired conclusion, and you will reach the same conclusion, whether you like it or not.  gt; are still taking the life from a being that has as much right to live as you do, for no reason whatsoever except "meat taste good". Yeah, same problem here. There are no  #8216;rights #8217; and you #8217;ve certainly never justified any of them. Given our cold, bleak universe my life has no moral weight other than to me, and an emotional weight to those I have relationships with, so while no doubt the animal is in no way  #8216;morally inferior #8217; it #8217;s life still means nothing, and it especially has no  #8216;right #8217; to anything. Again, please start backing up your claims.  gt; So basically, because a human is more "intelligent" and able to perceive reality you have more reasons to let him live. Push this idea a little further and you fall very quickly into fascism and ableism. Why stop at animals, why not kill all "dumb" people with an inferior perception of themselves? Or all mentally handicaped? Schizophrenics? In the same vein, again, why would I want to kill them. Yes, there is no moral consequence of me doing so, but I have no reason I #8217;d want to kill them, why would I kill all dumb people? Tbh I see no problem with pulling the plug on people in a vegetative state because they are not alive in any relevant way no will they be that I can empathise with. That aside though, even if what I #8217;d said didn #8217;t apply, you are arguing that my case is wrong simply because it leads to conclusions you don #8217;t like, which is a fallacy. Even if it did lead to those conclusions, that doesn #8217;t invalidate the argument especially seeing as you seem unable to find logical flaws in it. Yeah, if I was petting a random animal I may not feel the desire to go and slit its throat. It doesn #8217;t benefit me in the moment, it doesn #8217;t make me a happier or more fulfilled person, but that is irrelevant to the fact that when I want to I may eat meat. The fact there is nothing bad about it also means there is nothing  #8216;good #8217; about doing so, I have no moral compulsion to kill that cow, but if it satisfies me to do so because I want to meat then I may. It means I may focus on other liberators struggles that are more relevant to me and the people I care about rather than boycotting and fighting them because they aren #8217;t  #8216;pure #8217; enough.</TEXT>

By being part of an ML party that would suggest you have a rather bias view when you visit it and that you are likely shown what you want to see, namely the good things. Also while your party may visit, have you ever? You didn #8217;t make that clear, and frankly I #8217;m more inclined to believe someone who grew up there than some Tankie. You also seem to have no idea what the state is and how it functions, and your suggestion that state ownership is worker ownership is simply laughable. The fact of the matter is that I don #8217;t control how my workplace is run, and I don #8217;t get the product of my labour or decide what to produce. Bureaucrats decide all of that for me and yet because they arbitrarily claim to represent me somehow I now control my MoP. Gtfo of here that #8217;s just patently ridiculous. Not to mention countries will earn the right to be defended by me, none of them  #8216;deserve #8217; my respect or support especially when they deprive worker #8217;s of the MoP and product of their labour, the very thing we despise capitalists for.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Lmao that isn #8217;t what socialism is in the slightest, Bernie #8217;s social democracy isn #8217;t socialism stop pretending and strawmanning that it is, it is simply regulated capitalism. I oppose taxes, and I can do that because taxes bear no relation whatsoever to socialism, though obviously the pitiful excuse for an education system that America has wouldn #8217;t teach you that. Again, I must reiterate, socialism is about controlling your workplace and the products of your labour, so that a capitalist doesn #8217;t take that which you produce (profit). Government is counterproductive to this goal so we oppose it to, as well because of the hierarchy inherent to it, which is antithetical to any nations of freedom. Libertarianism again was not originally a capitalist word, stop pretending that it is. Your entire argument is full of straw mans and is in bad faith, but to show you why socialists oppose capitalism I #8217;ll link something from elsewhere.  gt; What is capitalism? Understanding the basis of this is instrumental to answering this question, namely, is capitalism, and by extension capitalists, by their very nature exploitative? In this day and age, the answer of what truly makes up the social and economic system that dominates the globe seems more and more obscured, and with that obscurity so dissappears widespread dissent and opposition that was a major feature of the struggles of the last century. Before delving deeper, we should define what we mine by the terms  #8216;capitalist #8217;, exploitation and private property as our use of it differs from mainstream interpretation. Here, a capitalist is someone who owns a means of production (such as a factory, company, or land) or lives off the extraction of someone else #8217;s labour (such as landlords, investors or loan sharks), and by private property we mean ownership of things that other people use (such as owning a factory which is used not by you, but by those who produce the goods there (the workers), or owning a house which you rent out (it is the tenant, not you, who uses it). Exploitation should be taken to mean any taking of the labour of someone else, not simply maltreatment of a worker, where it tends to be used nowadays.  gt;But what is particularly exploitative about capitalism? To answer this, we must look at what forms the basis of this system, namely private property. Contrary to how many capitalist apologists try to portray it, what makes capitalism distinct as a socioeconomic system is not market exchange, but rather private property and the things that stem from it. Under capitalism, the means of production are to a large degree monopolised under the control of a single class, that being the capitalist class. This creates a class of people, the proletariat or  #8216;working class #8217; who possess nothing to sell to survive except their labour power, namely their ability to be productive and make things, and in doing so create value. This means that the majority of a society are driven to work for capitalist, to seek employment from him, on pain of starvation. This is the scenario of which workers in a present system are faced, but how does this create exploitation?  gt;Due to the capitalist #8217;s control over the means of production, and hence the worker #8217;s livelihood, he has the power to control and regiment them, but even more importantly, to appropriate the products of their labour. The worker produces their goods through the expenditure of their labour, and yet the employer, solely by virtue of ownership, which is granted to him by the state and backed with the threat of violence (how private property is enforced), receives total control over his workers #8217; produce, taking a significant portion of it to sustain and enrich himself, or to put it another way, to amass capital (from which derives the name capitalism). To envision this theft clearly, let #8217;s look at an example. Suppose that I am a worker, who despite there being abundant unused land to work on, am excluded form it by threat of violence (I will be beaten up or forcibly kidnapped by the police force should I attempt to), and in the extreme, by death, should I attempt to work it, because a capitalist claims it as his own, again despite not using it. To survive, as I must, I agree (in the loosest possible sense, as in reality this situation is no better than if a gun were pointed at my head), to work for one of the landowners and grow apples. I work day in, day out, to grow the trees and ensure that they are healthy (in reality this is partaken by multiple workers, but for the purposes of the example I will keep it at only one), and when the time comes, I pick them and transport them to the market. They sell, and I find out I have produced  #163;1000 worth of apples in 100 hours of work, and yet my employer, despite doing nothing for the production of the apples, and who could have been in another country for all it mattered, takes up to  #163;700 for himself. He has robbed me of that which my labour alone produced, and in effect I did 70 hours of unpayed labour, from which derives the term  #8216;wage slavery #8217;, because we devote a significant portion, if not the majority of our time at work, not producing for ourselves or our family, or even the needs of our community, but rather simply to support the parasitic entity that is the employer, and it is this appropriation of the workers #8217; labour that is called profit.  gt;But, you cry, in reality the employer does not sit aside and do nothing but partakes in organisation or production. While, in many cases, this is true (though less so nowdays due to ownership of a company being distributed in shares in the stockmarket, and the holders of said shares certainly don #8217;t contribute to production), their contribution is by no means proportional to the benefits they reap in terms of wealth and power over their workers. Yes, an employer may take care of the organisational side to a degree, but it #8217;s ridiculous to suggest that this small amount of work entitles him to total control over the collective surplus of goods, rather he should have equal power to the others that work in said workplace, in a form of direct democracy. What should absolutely be rejected is the notion that they  #8216;create #8217; jobs.. What in reality is happening is that the capitalists are merely giving permission for them to work, they aren #8217;t creating anything in and of itself, let alone producing something of use to society. Many claim that the capitalist has worked hard to own their company, and thus deserve the profit they exploit from their workers, or that the worker had the opportunity to become the capitalist if they #8217;d worked harder. This is flawed for several reasons, the first is that self-employed only make up around 15% of the working population , and it should be noted this figure includes that of  #8216;bogus self employed #8217; in which employers pretend their workers are self employed in order to avoid paying them a fair wage, and so exploit even more of the work they produce. Clearly here not working for a capitalist is not an option for the majority of the population, and those who do manage it often come from wealthier backgrounds. Even for the people who do slave away to create enough money to employ others to work for them (start a business), though it should be noted that here capitalist apologists admit that one must sell themselves to a capitalist to gain this capital, but even in this scenario, there is no logical reason this justifies the theft of another #8217;s labour. Would it matter if a slave bought their freedom and then created their own plantation? No, because regardless of how the exploiter got there, it wouldn #8217;t make the institution of slavery morally correct, and likewise it fails to in the case of capitalism.  gt;In summary, it is clear that the above phrase is correct, because once we look deeper at capitalism and the social relations it is built upon it becomes evident that the capitalist, simply another word for an employer or any other owner of the means of production, exploits his workers, and that this appropriation of the products of their labour as his own is in reality no better than state sanctioned theft, in which the capitalist leeches of the work of others, and that this parasitism is inseparable from the economic system and cannot be merely reformed away, or in doing so you will change the system.

    <TEXT>Lmao what are you, 8? You #8217;re such a fucking child that you don #8217;t even know the shit you #8217;re talking about yet act like a fucking professor. No, capitalism is not a market system, and there are many market systems that are not capitalism. Capitalism is the predominance of wage labour in a market system with private property. Socialism is not what you claimed you absolute spastic that is social democracy. Seeing as capitalism is not defined by markets but rather by property norms and wage labour, it is perfectly plausible for government to exist within it, and they are mutually reinforcing with capitalism rarely if ever coming about without a state. I have no fucking clue where you learnt your definitions but they are utterly wrong and just make you look like a retard when you repeat them. Socialism is social/worker control over the means of production and has absolutely fuck all to do with taxes. You #8217;re probably one of those 33 yo incels with a neckbeard who #8217;s life is defined by anime and bootlicking. Fuck off and get life. Don #8217;t bother to respond to this as you #8217;re obviously an egit who has nothing of value to say.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think this is again misleading. Profit is a moral. Capitalists aren #8217;t imperialist because they would rather that Brown people do the gruelling stuff, they do so because it is cheaper. If it was cheaper or possible to replicate those conditions in white countries, they would. Imperialism and colonialism was thoroughly tied up with racism, but it is an overly simplistic explanation. They don #8217;t dominate these nations because they aren #8217;t white, they do so because they are poor and less developed.</TEXT>

A democratic socialism still wants to achieve socialism (social ownership of the means of production), they just want to get there by participating in the electoral process, but they want the same thing as other socialists.

    <TEXT>I think that #8217;s a big misunderstanding of what people are actually saying. What they advocate is direct democracy *in concert* with voluntary association. A commune is a network of individuals who are pooling labour and resources, like a club, and for practical reasons will no doubt be formed among people who are geographically close, but it doesn #8217;t have to be, it has no  #8216;border #8217; within which it has power, and you can enter and exit the association as you wish. Community generally references the voluntary association in this case.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Tbh TVP people just come across as somewhat utopian/technocratic anarchists (I am an anarchist jftr). The only difference I can see is they seem to demand that everyone conforms to their way of life as opposed to letting free individuals decide among themselves, a dedication to a RBE I can understand (it is pretty much identical to what anarchists propose, apart from all the weird  #8216;AI will plan and decide everything for us and will know exactly what we want #8217; stuff) but their devotion to particular designs of cities, and basically just obsession with micromanaging everything, comes across as a bit cultish, not to mention their weird reliance on technology that doesn #8217;t exist (don #8217;t get me wrong, we can automate a lot, but they blow this *way* out of proportion, and basically just come across as na #239;ve) A second thing is that their obsession with micromanagement as well as their idea of cities controlling production seems antithetical to ideas of free association and lack of hierarchy, do I have to move city if some people outvote me? Do I even get a vote and autonomy in my own life, or does some AI overlord do that for me? Basically TVP comes across as a Jacque Fresco fan club, with not particularly thought out and practical solutions to problems, which is a shame, given the core ideals are good, though frankly identical to anarchism.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Trust me, anarchists place _a lot_ of emphasis on sustainability, which is part of the reason many of us reject capitalism, due to its need for relentless compound growth being unsustainable in a finite world. All the stuff you mentioned in your post, anarchists support and centre around as well, trust me, this is part of the reason anarchists are all scratching their heads at the RBE movement, because at the core of it they are advocating exactly what we have been for the past century and a half, and acting as if it completely new. A critique I would give is that RBE seems to take the same approach as many  #8216;green capitalists #8217; in that a simple change in technology will change everything, and don #8217;t really seem to take into consideration that our current consumption levels are unsustainable, especially once we can no longer externalise the costs of it onto less developed nations. Don #8217;t get me wrong, it #8217;s a great start, but it doesn #8217;t go the whole way in terms of realistic consideration and analysis of the problems, and is fairly superficial in that regard. The biggest differing factor is that we don #8217;t want to  #8216;design #8217; societies, as that as by its very nature paternalistic and authoritarian, but rather we want people to control their own lives and organise as is best for them, in order that they are best able to adapt to their own conditions and problems, and solve them, not to organise in the way a few architects sitting in a house in Florida decided they should. People will tend towards ecological solutions and create a multitude of them towards their current problems, but it has to be from the ground up, and not some one-size-fits-all solution imposed on them from outside.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>[here](https://youtu.be/3SZT7MZop44) is an anarchist critique of the general TVP/TZM movement and project. I mean you #8217;ve pretty much just described an anarchist economy, as we aren #8217;t opposed to use of computers and automation in facilitating production. The problem here is that you make it sound as if this computer/AI is making the decisions about what to produce. Not only does this somewhat overestimate the current capacities of AI (assuming it is to completely and independently plan) but also takes agency away from people in terms of what they want to produce and consumer, it is dehumanising the process. Perhaps I am misunderstanding what you are advocating, but within anarchism consumer cooperatives and communes would decide what goods they desire, and each household/individual would likely have a consumption list which they change according to their needs, this is then acted upon by the various syndicates and confederations and they reach an agreement on production. It is untrue that production can be fully automated and human labour taken out of the equation, and again, you make it sound as if this central computer in the city Is deciding people #8217;s needs and producing the commodities in the factories, without actual human input. No doubt people will use technology to aid the planning and distribution process, but it would and should only ever be an aid. If this is what you are proposing then cool, you #8217;re an anarchist. Again, the problem is TVP seems to prescribe this as the way things *must* be done. Not only does this wholesale construction of cities look impersonal, bland and lacking variety, basically places to live that ignore people #8217;s social needs, as opposed to basic ones, and again takes away people #8217;s agency in how they want to live, in favour of a one size fits all solution, but shifting everyone to these newly constructed cities would be a colossal waste of labour and resources, which could be more efficiently used upgrading and repurposing present living arrangements. But communities should grow organically and according to their own needs, not some prescribed solution. If they want that claimed efficiency, they can organise to achieve it, but heralding it as a solution for all is ridiculous, dogmatic and again slightly cultish. You misunderstood my point here. It #8217;s not  #8216;can people live in the country #8217; but is a criticism that if I live in a city it has the single central organising computer around which everything is based, and so is in effect a government, I have no room to associate as I wish, if I disagree with a group decision, be it production or general, I cannot simply exit the association, I must physically move, it is an idea which suppresses variation and bottom up organisation for the purpose of a very narrow minded solution. TVP at its core is anarchist, and it is odd that they deny or ignore this and act as if they are their own special thing, thus not allying and organising with other groups with the same goals. It just lacks the centuries of analysis and thought of the general anarchist movement and as a result comes across as slightly half-baked, and cultish in their devotion to *the one solution*, with same weird utopian stuff in TVP about technology, especially in regards to construction, in which they magicked up some scifi babble as the solution to how things would be constructed in the future, which doesn #8217;t exist and which we are decades off creating if at all. They seem a bit obsessed with designing their text book utopia (not to mention thrusting it on others as if others want the same thing), regardless if whether it is applicable to our modern society.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It is true that in part value is created through the exploitation of animal labour, though it can be said that like other machinery, the farmer uses these to boost his own productivity in production, and his job still involves a vast amount of manual work, all of which contributes to production, while your average CEO does not partake on the production floor, he merely organises and reorganises labour to places where it will produce the most value, but it is nonetheless labour producing that value. It is also true that the for the farmer, the cows will not sow the field and reap the crops in the farmers absence, in this instance they are, as previously stated, more akin to machinery, whereas in the case of the CEO this does not hold.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Wow...that #8217;s a *lot* of strawmanning and wilful misinterpretation.  gt; Ah, so the slavedriver uses the slaves to boost his own productivity in production? And whipping the slaves is hard manual work? No, this is a bad analogy from you because it doesn #8217;t translate well. All the slavedriver does is attempt to increase the efficiency of the slaves #8217; labour, he does not use the slaves to enhance his own productive efforts in growing cotton. As I said, the animals are akin to machinery in the analogy, which doesn #8217;t fit in the slave example.  gt;Wrong. The CEO doesn't do anything that increases value production. It #8217;s true that he himself does not create value in production, but his role is to create production decisions that facilitate the greatest extraction of value, ie, lowering wages, increasing work hours, externalising costs. These are all actions that are taken by the CEO to increase surplus value extraction, but this value is from the workers, not the CEO.  gt; Ah, so the animals produce all the value through their labor, not the farmer. I mean this simply isn #8217;t what I said, at this point you #8217;re just arguing in bad faith and being deliberately obtuse. If you reread what I actually said, I explained how the farmer creates value.  gt; Wrong. That's not true because slaves will work when the slavedriver is absent. Employees work just as well when a manager is absent as they do when the manager is present. The manager's presence has 0 effect on employee productivity. This was my entire point, and the difference between the farmer-animal and CEO-employee relationship. I mean at this point you just seem to be scoring an own goal and supporting worker self-management, which is fine by me, but somewhat problematic for you. The purpose of the CEO is to maximise profit extraction, they may attempt to fo that through productivity increases, or just as likely they will try to cut costs and erode wages.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>What is it with capitalists and strawmen? Do you make a conscious effort to utterly misunderstand what your opponent is saying, or does it just come naturally to you? As I have stated before, the CEO #8217;s actions, examples of which you listed above, do result in more surplus value being extracted and thus increase profits, that is why the capitalists hire them. However, as I have stated previously, that value does not come from the CEO #8217;s labour, which merely reorganises value production to make it more efficient and ensure more is extracted from the labourer, the value, while allowed to be realised due to the CEO #8217;s actions, doesn #8217;t come from him, so he isn #8217;t being exploited, at least in the same degree. Let #8217;s look at an example. Suppose there was someone working in a quarry. He swings his pick axe every 30 seconds, but the CEO comes along and makes him swing it every 20 seconds. Now, more is being produced and so more value is being produced for the company. The CEO #8217;s reorganisation of the worker #8217;s labour caused this value to be created, but it was the worker, to the CEO, who swung his pick axe more frequently, that actually created the value. CEO #8217;s are useful to the capitalist because they get people to swing pick axes faster, it they aren #8217;t actually creating the value.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is only true in select examples. First of all, most farmers use machines not animals, which complement their labour, allowing them to be more productive and in turn reduce prices, but ultimately they still put labour into it, the machines inky lesson amount of labour they have to. Likewise with animals, animals exert their own labour (though not consciously), and lessen the labour the farmer expends, but that doesn #8217;t mean he exerts no labour in production, which he still does.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>None of this contradicts what I wrote above, which is why you seem to misunderstand it, and so create a strawman which I #8217;m not arguing for to rebut. Management means that more value is created in a company, that #8217;s what I #8217;m saying, and so you could simplistically say that as such management  #8216;adds #8217; value, but it is important to note this added value does not come from management itself creating value, only organising the creators of value in such a way as they create more. So management results in more value for a company, but that value isn #8217;t *created* by management. All of your elaboration on jobs management does is irrelevant and doesn #8217;t contradict my argument in any way, and I don #8217;t see the point of your disputation if the analogy. The whole point of the analogy was it #8217;s simplistic and isn #8217;t meant to perfectly reflect managerial methods, and while it is true external motivators are very poor, and without a doubt worse than internal ones, that #8217;s irrelevant to the argument at hand and wasn #8217;t an important part of the analogy. It #8217;s just being pedantic.  gt; I mean, just try doing one of those stupid team building exercises where you tell a random group of 5 people to build X out of three plastic straws, a wire tie, and 2 marshmallows, and don't put anyone in charge of it. Nothing close to the stated goal happens. I mean this is just factually and historically untrue, and multiple times throughout history we can point to examples of worker self-management such as the Spanish Revolution of Argentina co-op movement, in which the company actually increased in productivity and quality of results, by cutting out the useless middlemen and doing things themselves, and there is a strong positive correlation between democracy in the workplace and productivity, suggesting management isn #8217;t a necessary part of general productive life. But all this isn #8217;t really relevant to the argument of whether the manager actually produces the value or simply organises labour in order that it may produce more value.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks for the link. It seems Israel did not explicitly create Hamas, but aided (not created) its predecessor organisation (which started off as an Islamic charity) due to their beef with the PLO, and after the 1994 accords and the PLO #8217;s recognition of Israel, Hamas became the main enemy. So you #8217;re right to a limited extent, but it #8217;s not as clear cut as you make it sound.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Could you provide a source for the claim that drug related crimes make up the large bulk of their executions? Because I did find a report that showed 27% of executions in the region where due to drug related crimes, but that hardly explains or excuses the other 73% (not to mention that recidivist drug use is punishable by death in Iran, along with a host of other things such as adultery and sodomy). As for the article, the war on drugs is not inherently progressive, and supply side tactics and an incredibly poor way of conducting it the only leads to death and the destruction of lives, rather than focuses on te material factors that lead people to heavy drug use, such as the stress and alienation of modern capitalist society, the stigma which often means people don #8217;t seek rehabilitation, and particularly in the US the medical system which due to its profit orientation massively overly prescribes opioids which act as a gateway. Iran executed 567 people in 2016 and 560 people in 2017 (that we know of), so yes, while true there was a drop, it was hardly a significant one and so your point is misleading and largely irrelevant. Iran is great on refugees, I #8217;m not arguing that. Turkey has slightly under the same amount of refugees at about 4 million, that doesn #8217;t somehow mean it isn #8217;t socially repressive and sliding into autocracy, and likewise Iran #8217;s refugee program (which, again, is great) doesn #8217;t invalidate all the other socially repressive aspects of the regime. Emancipation of women is a key aspect of socialism, and you have completely glossed over my points about Iran #8217;s extreme conservatism and subsequent social repressiveness to LGB people (Iran does actually allow Trans people, which is a good and surprising thing) as well as women and [ethnic minorities who are persecuted on account of their identity and beliefs](https://reliefweb.int/report/iran-islamic-republic/rights-denied-violations-against-ethnic-and-religious-minorities-iran), being subject to vilification and even arrests and executions. The debate here is not over whether Iran does anything good, but rather over the specific point of Denmark being more socially progressive than Iran, which again, seems pretty hard to dispute, and the entire first half of your response is irrelevant to that debate. Iran is an authoritarian theocracy, and is under no means at all socialist in any way shape or form, and should be criticised for its flaws and upheld for what it does well, but the answer I responded to was an incredibly one sided and childish rant with no support to back it up, and frankly invalidates the real oppression that the Iranian people face on account of their theocratic government and laws.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Look, there will always be certain individuals are apathetic towards murder or actively desire it, though it #8217;s important to note that mental illness simply means a mutation or evolutionary trait in the brain that negatively effects you. So yes, there is no reason that Dahmer should not commit murder, but likewise there is no reason we should not stop him, because we have empathy for the individuals he kills and because he presents a clear and present threat to us. But to be clear, moral systems do nothing to stop these people either, they will want to kill regardless. I would tend to agree with others here, which is that for such individuals, we should kill them and be done with it. These people, as you yourself admit, are beyond rehabilitation, because this is a natural and intrinsic part of them, and as such they cannot safely be set free with other people, and I certainly don #8217;t want to spend my labour producing to keep them alive in captivity, and I certainly have little empathy for these individuals, and I especially don #8217;t want to risk their chance of escape, because no egoist society would have the will to maintain some kind of supermax prison for such people, thus killing them seems to be the only option, and the fact that it is a  #8216;mental illness #8217; that leads them to do commit murder means nothing, and if anything is an argument in favour of their murder because they cannot safety exist with others (unless it is some freak psychotic breakdown, as opposed to an intrinsic desire, in which case rehabilitation and medical care would work). You could try kill Mr. Insulin, though most people wouldn #8217;t as they have empathy which would restrain them, and others who do have empathy would respond negatively to it, but surely it makes more sense to pool your resources communistically? That way you gain access to insulin, and Mr. Insulin gains access to the fruits of your labour.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Anarchists are against hierarchy, not only the state, and as such are anti-capitalist as well. Socialism simply means social or worker control over the means of production which is perfectly compatible with anarchism. It does not require nationalisations of any kind. Classes are a relation to the Means of Production, namely private property, which are reinforced by the state. The state creates classes, you don #8217;t need it to abolish them. Class are not middle/upper/lower class, which are meaningless and arbitrary distinctions. And the vast majority of anarchists are anarcho-communists.</TEXT>

Whenever they say x is wrong because of y, simply ask them what is wrong about y. All moral arguments are predicated on assumptions, just ask why until you reach their base assumption (for AnCaps, the self-ownership principle) and ask them to justify it, if they do, they will take another assumption in doing so, ie you own your body and so infringement on your ownership is wrong and akin to a personal attack. Harsh as it sounds, simply ask why that is wrong. From then on, once you have shown private property rights to be baseless and hollow, simply point out it isn #8217;t in the worker #8217;s interest to support a parasitic leach on their labour, so they have no reason to organise in capitalist arrangements.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; If you don't believe in a higher power or meaning of life, there is no way to justify morality except for pragmatic reasons. Yes  gt;Do you like having violence initiated against you (unless it's voluntary)? No. Neither do I nor anybody else. It's rather disruptive to human society... Cool and for that reason (my ability to empathise) I probably won #8217;t, but in the event that I do want to (perhaps the capitalist is exploiting me or asserting hierarchy over me) then there is no reason that I *shouldn #8217;t* respond with violence, especially in regards to respecting made up property rights that I have no reason to respect and which infringe on my ability and desire to use stuff. There #8217;s no such thing as a separate body  #8216;society #8217; only groups of individuals. I may care for them, (as do most people) I may not, but that #8217;s not an argument for private property norms.  gt; How about we use that as a basis for ethics? Actually we already do. We just make stupid exceptions (the government can initiate violence and somehow most think it's ok). Nah I #8217;m ok. I don #8217;t care about  #8216;initiating violence #8217; apart from to the extent I empathise with it (I most assuredly do not empathise with either a state or a capitalist #8217;s property). I certainly don #8217;t want to found a spookish ethics system on this, which tells me what I  #8216;should #8217; do, when all I care about is what I want to do. By true or false what do you mean? There are empirically true facts, ie, the doppler effect, whereas matters of morality and  #8216;should #8217; are made up.</TEXT>
