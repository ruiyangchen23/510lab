More than 100 people have walked out of Lars von Trier #8217;s  #8216;The House That Jack Built, #8217; which depicts the mutilation of women and children.  #8220;It #8217;s disgusting, #8221; one woman said on her way out." -"Just left Lars Von Trier's The House that Jack Built. Gross. Pretentious. Vomitive. Torturous. Pathetic" -"Walked out on Lars von Trier . Vile movie. Should not have been made. Actors culpable" -"I've just walked out of Lars Von Trier premiere at Cannes 2018 because seeing children being shot and killed is not art or entertainment." -------------------------------------------- That's one way to get buzz at Cannes I guess. What were these people expecting from a Lars Von Trier serial killer movie though?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Review Thread - 'Solo: A Star Wars Story'</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-05-15 23:23:55</DATE>
    <TEXT>Review embargo just lifted on *Solo*. Looks pretty okay/passable/meh so far. Looks like nobody really hates it, but nobody really loves it either. **Rotten Tomatoes**: [72% - 6.4 Average Rating](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/solo_a_star_wars_story/) **Rotten Tomatoes' Consensus**: *"A flawed yet fun and fast-paced space adventure, Solo: A Star Wars Story should satisfy newcomers to the saga as well as longtime fans who check their expectations at the theater door."* **Metacritic**: [66](http://www.metacritic.com/movie/solo-a-star-wars-story) ----------------------------------------- [The Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/solo-a-star-wars-story-review-1111495) - *Michael Rechtshaffen*  gt; -Alden Ehrenreich engagingly conveys young Harrison Ford in this throwback origins story directed by Ron Howard. [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/15/17355964/solo-a-star-wars-story-review-ron-howard) - *Bryan Bishop*  gt; -Solo: A Star Wars Story is classic Star Wars, and if it ends up being the last time Lawrence Kasdan writes a movie in this universe, it #8217;s one incredibly entertaining, instructive swan song. [Collider](http://collider.com/solo-movie-review/) - *Matt Goldberg*  gt; -And sadly, Solo: A Star Wars Story is just another Star Wars movie. Despite the strong performance from Ehrenreich and the hint of future adventures to come, I can only hope that this young Solo gets better stories and better direction that play into the character #8217;s personality. Han Solo is a roguish, daring character. Shouldn #8217;t his movie follow suit? [IGN](http://www.ign.com/articles/2018/05/15/solo-a-star-wars-story-review) - *Jim Vejvoda*  gt; -Solo: A Star Wars Story commits to being a charming and fun exercise in repackaging nostalgia and pre-owned protagonists. It #8217;s just too bad its script never fully committed to seeing through Han #8217;s arc  #8212; and those characters who are supposed to have shaped him into being the iconic version we all know and love  #8212; to its preordained end. [TheWrap](https://www.thewrap.com/solo-a-star-wars-story-film-review-alden-ehrenreich-donald-glover/) - *Alonso Duralde*  gt; - So-So Prequel Says Nothing New About Beloved Characters [Slate](https://slate.com/culture/2018/05/solo-the-new-star-wars-movie-reviewed.html) - *Sam Adams*  gt; -The meh is strong with this one.

[Associated Press](https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/review-scoundrel-born-star-wars-spinoff-solo-55188290) - *Lindsay Bahr*  gt; -"Solo" is a straightforward piece of pulpy entertainment with some very agreeable performances from Ehrenreich and Glover, who seems to be having the most fun of all the actors in playing up Lando's suave demeanor, and fun classic Western flourishes, despite the excessively big action sequences. [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2018/05/15/solo-review-a-star-wars-story-that-plays-like-an-indiana-jones-movie/#db2b6737987d) - *Scott Mendelson*  gt; -I enjoyed Solo: A Star Wars Story more than I expected to, but it #8217;s also the first live-action theatrical Star Wars film that doesn #8217;t feel like an event. I #8217;ll let you decide if that #8217;s a compliment or a criticism. [Polygon](https://www.polygon.com/2018/5/15/17353438/solo-a-star-wars-story-review-alden-ehrenreich) - *Julia Alexander*  gt; -Solo: A Star Wars Story defied the odds to become a cohesive, cool blockbuster [USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2018/05/15/review-young-han-solo-star-wars-movie-gambles-wins/609801002/) - *Brian Truitt*  gt; - 'Solo' gambles (and wins) by not being just another 'Star Wars' movie [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/15/movies/solo-a-star-wars-story-review.html) - *AO Scott*  gt; - #8216;Solo: A Star Wars Story #8217; Answers Questions You Might Not Have Asked [Chicago Tribune](http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/sc-mov-solo-star-wars-rev-0515-story.html) - *Michael Phillips*  gt; -Howard #8217;s efficient, confident, slightly square direction does the job. It #8217;s his best film in a decade. At times, working with a small army of digital wizards, he seems to be channeling the spirit of the car-crash pileups of  #8220;Grand Theft Auto. #8221; Only this time, the vehicles really move. [Den of Geek](http://www.denofgeek.com/us/movies/solo-a-star-wars-story/273494/solo-a-star-wars-story-review) - *Don Kaye*  gt; -Solo is not a bad film, just a relentlessly average one that has no reason to exist except as a money machine. It gets its protagonist from point A to point B efficiently enough, but it doesn #8217;t tell us anything we need to know that we didn #8217;t already glean from our first meeting with Han in a cantina 40 years ago. It doesn #8217;t shake up the mythology or offer any real emotional investment, yet at the same time it #8217;s funny, fairly fast-moving and at times enjoyable [Entertainment Weekly](http://ew.com/movies/2018/05/15/solo-a-star-wars-story-review/) - *Chris Nashawaty*  gt; -Han Solo gets a good (but not great) origin tale ------------------------------------------- **Description:** Board the Millennium Falcon and journey to a galaxy far, far away in Solo: A Star Wars Story, an all-new adventure with the most beloved scoundrel in the galaxy. Through a series of daring escapades deep within a dark and dangerous criminal underworld, Han Solo meets his mighty future copilot Chewbacca and encounters the notorious gambler Lando Calrissian, in a journey that will set the course of one of the Star Wars saga's most unlikely heroes. **Release Date:** May 25, 2018 **Director:** Ron Howard **Starring:** * Alden Ehrenreich * Emilia Clarke * Donald Glover * Woody Harrelson * Thandie Newton * Phoebe Waller-Bridge * Paul Bettany **Writers:** Lawrence Kasdan  amp; Joe Kasdan **Running Time:** 135 Minutes</TEXT>

    <DATE>2018-05-18 20:08:53</DATE>
    <TEXT>Well, this is disappointing. *The Man Who Killed Don Quixote* just premiered at Cannes and the reviews aren't good. The consensus seems to be that it's a mess. **Rotten Tomatoes**: [57%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_man_who_killed_don_quixote?) **Metacritic**: [49](http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-man-who-killed-don-quixote) ------------------------------------------------------------ [Variety](http://variety.com/2018/film/reviews/the-man-who-killed-don-quixote-review-1202815359/) - *Peter Debruge*  gt;-After countless false starts and dead ends, Terry Gilliam brings his magnum opus to screen  #8212; and it's a loud, belligerent, barely coherent mess. [Indiewire](http://www.indiewire.com/2018/05/the-man-who-killed-don-quixote-review-terry-gilliam-adam-driver-cannes-1201966091/) - *Eric Kohn*  gt; -Terry Gilliam #8217;s Long-Delayed Passion Project Is Sloppy, But Not a Total Disappointment [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/may/18/the-man-who-killed-don-quixote-review-cannes-2018-terry-gilliam) - *Peter Bradshaw*  gt; -After a three-decade production ordeal Gilliam has delivered a sun-baked fable of money, madness and the movie business  #8211; and done so with trademark infectious charm [Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/man-who-killed-don-quixote-cannes-2018-1113133) - *David Rooney*  gt; -Stone dead and beyond rescue [Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/man-killed-don-quixote-review-terry-gilliams-25-years-quest/) - *Robbie Collin*  gt; -Terry Gilliam's 25-year quest ends in a wistful, slapsticky shambles [Playlist](https://theplaylist.net/terry-gilliam-don-quixote-cannes-review-20180518/) - *Jessica Kiang*  gt; -Terry Gilliam #8217;s Cursed  #8216;The Man Who Killed Don Quixote #8217; Is Real And Surprisingly Not A Complete Mess [Collider](http://collider.com/the-man-who-killed-don-quixote-review/) - *Gregory Ellwood*  gt; -Terry Gilliam #8217;s Long-Awaited Passion Project Has Little Magic [The Times UK](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/film-review-the-man-who-killed-don-quixote-at-the-cannes-film-festival-dgq69dcjt) - *Ed Potton*  gt; -As the director Terry Gilliam predicted, after 25 years in the making, his passion project is beautiful and terrible at the same time [Screen International](https://www.screendaily.com/reviews/the-man-who-killed-don-quixote-cannes-review/5129514.article) - *Tim Grierson*  gt; -Despite how personally the filmmaker connects with this ambitious riff on the Cervantes novel, the long-time passion project succumbs to the same indulgences and weaknesses that have plagued his recent movies. [Dork Shelf](http://dorkshelf.com/2018/05/18/cannes-2018-the-man-who-killed-don-quixote-review/) - *Jason Gorber*  gt; -It deserves to be seen. ------------------------------------------------ **Description:** Toby, a cynical advertising director finds himself trapped in the outrageous delusions of an old Spanish shoe-maker who believes himself to be Don Quixote. In the course of their comic and increasingly surreal adventures, Toby is forced to confront the tragic repercussions of a film he made in his idealistic youth - a film that changed the hopes and dreams of a small Spanish village forever. Can Toby make amends and regain his humanity? Can Don Quixote survive his madness and imminent death? Or will love conquer all? **Starring:** * Adam Driver * Jonathan Pryce * Stellan Skarsg #229;rd * Olga Kurylenko **Budget:** $16,000,000 **Release Date:** Unknown (Amazon backed out of distribution last week) **Writer  amp; Director:** Terry Gilliam</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Review embargo just lifted on *Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom*. It's looking pretty okay/mediocre/middling so far. **Rotten Tomatoes**: [62%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/jurassic_world_fallen_kingdom/) - 6.1 Average Rating - 34 Reviews **Metacritic**: [54](http://www.metacritic.com/movie/jurassic-world-fallen-kingdom) ---------------------------------------------------------------------- [ScreenCrush](http://screencrush.com/jurassic-world-fallen-kingdom-review/) - *Matt Singer*  gt; This isn #8217;t just a film you need to  #8220;turn off your brain #8221; to enjoy; nothing less than surgically removing your brain from your body would do the trick. [Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/jurassic-world-fallen-kingdom-review-1117350) - *John Defore*  gt; A thrill ride that finally escapes the theme park. [Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/jurassic-world-fallen-kingdom-review-hollywood-finds-way-make/) - *Robbie Collin*  gt; Hollywood finds a way to make dinosaurs boring. [Gizmodo](https://io9.gizmodo.com/jurassic-world-fallen-kingdom-lacks-the-majesty-the-fr-1826580479) - *Germain Lussier*  gt; Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom Lacks the Majesty the Franchise Is Known for. [IGN](http://www.ign.com/articles/2018/06/05/jurassic-world-fallen-kingdom-review) - *Gav Murphy*  gt; Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom opens with one of the most exciting set pieces of the year and from there it barely stops for breath as we #8217;re bounced from a huge, high-stakes disaster film to a claustrophobic gothic horror. [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jun/05/jurassic-world-fallen-kingdom-review-dino-flaws-galore-in-series-headed-for-extinction) - *Peter Bradshaw*  gt; JA Bayona #8217;s adventure boasts some passable set pieces, but the plot is contrived, the characters fatigued, the cliches abundant  #8211; and the beasties t-rexecrable. [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/9442fa76f34d42f2800ae297c843dda2/Review:-%27Jurassic-World-2%27-leans-on-nostalgia,-contrivances) - *Lindsay Bahr*  gt;  #8220;Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom #8221; gets away with its unoriginality for the most part, but this franchise #8217;s desperation is starting to show. It #8217;s time to evolve or go extinct. [CBR](https://www.cbr.com/jurassic-world-fallen-kingdom-film-review/) - *Meg Downey*  gt; The end results are unsatisfying to say the least, muddled at best and egregious at worst. [Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/jurassic-world-fallen-kingdom-review-chris-pratt-bayona-goldblum-film-a8385246.html) - *Geoffrey McNab*  gt; Action-packed dinosaur sequel has so much momentum holes in the plot are hardly noticeable.

Isla Nublar now sits abandoned by humans while the surviving dinosaurs fend for themselves in the jungles. When the island's dormant volcano begins roaring to life, Owen (Chris Pratt) and Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) mount a campaign to rescue the remaining dinosaurs from this extinction-level event. Owen is driven to find Blue, his lead raptor who's still missing in the wild, and Claire has grown a respect for these creatures she now makes her mission. Arriving on the unstable island as lava begins raining down, their expedition uncovers a conspiracy that could return our entire planet to a perilous order not seen since prehistoric times. **Release Date:** June 22, 2018 **Starring:** * Chris Pratt * Bryce Dallas Howard * Rafe Spall * Justice Smith * Daniella Pineda * James Cromwell * B. D. Wong * Jeff Goldblum **Writers:** Colin Trevorrow  amp; Derek Connolly **Running Time:** 128 Minutes **Director:** J. A. Bayona ('The Impossible', 'A Monster Calls')</TEXT>

    <DATE>2018-06-12 01:49:28</DATE>
    <TEXT>Review embargo lifted on 'Incredibles 2' a few hours ago. Looking like another Pixar classic. Pretty great reviews across the board. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- **Rotten Tomatoes**: [95%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/incredibles_2) - Average Rating 8.1 - 43 Reviews **Metacritic**: [83](http://www.metacritic.com/g00/movie/incredibles-2?i10c.encReferrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8%3D amp;i10c.ua=1 amp;i10c.dv=14) **Rotten Tomatoes Critics Consensus**: Incredibles 2 reunites Pixar's family crimefighting team for a long-awaited follow-up that may not quite live up to the original, but comes close enough to earn its name. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- [Vulture](http://www.vulture.com/2018/06/incredibles-2-review.html) - *David Edelstein*  gt; It #8217;s proof that someone (not anyone, mainly Bird) can make a Marvel-type movie that #8217;s fleet and shapely, with action sequences rich in style rather than tumult. He #8217;s a crackerjack filmmaker first and a marvelous animator a close second, and he has made the jazziest hybrid in years. [The Playlist](https://theplaylist.net/incredibles-2-review-20180611/) - *Drew Taylor*  gt; It would have been a relief if, 14 years later, Incredibles 2 had simply met expectations. Instead, it exceeds them. [IndieWire](http://www.indiewire.com/2018/06/incredibles-2-review-brad-bird-pixar-1201973376/) - *David Ehrlich*  gt; Pixar #8217;s Dazzling Sequel Makes Superhero Movies Feel Human Again  gt; After a janky first act, Brad Bird finds the groove he's been looking for ever since "Ratatouille." [TheWrap](https://www.thewrap.com/incredibles-2-film-review-holly-hunter-brad-bird-pixar/) - *Robert Abele*  gt; Whatever the opposite of phoning in a sequel is, that #8217;s Brad Bird #8217;s progressive-minded, thunderously fun mix of super saves, throwback aesthetics and family comedy [USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2018/06/11/review-fun-incredibles-2-falls-short-masterful-pixar-original/688545002/) - *Brian Truitt*  gt; The animation is stellar and detailed in excellent action sequences, Michael Giacchino's score swings harder than ever, and the first film's family-friendly warmth is just as appealing now as it was then. [Uproxx](https://uproxx.com/movies/incredibles-2-review/) -* Mike Ryan*  gt;  #8216;Incredibles 2 #8242; Will Delight Fans Who Have Waited 14 Years For A Sequel [Variety](https://variety.com/2018/film/reviews/incredibles-2-review-holly-hunter-1202837069/) - *Owen Gleiberman* ^^^possible ^^^spoiler ^^^warning  gt; Brad Bird's sequel to his superhero-family Pixar classic doesn't build on the first film so much as dutifully replay it. It's fun, but far from incredible. [The Associated Press](https://apnews.com/430f6d0521974413ab9bd02848b004e0/Review:-Family-fun-and-insight-in-sprightly-'Incredibles-2') - *Lindsey Bahr*  gt; Like  #8220;Ready Player One, #8221; however,  #8220;Incredibles 2, #8221; kind of loses the thread by the end. A villain is a villain no matter how salient their point, and Mr. Incredible, Elastigirl and their offspring are our heroes and thus we must root for them even while thinking that Screenslaver might be on to something. [US Weekly](https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/the-incredibles-2-review-enjoy-a-smart-satisfying-and-super-adventure/) - *Mara Reinstein*  gt; Their adventures are timeless. And this one is worth the incredibly long wait. [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/goingoutguide/movies/witty-and-visually-stunning-incredibles-2-is-totally-worth-the-long-wait/2018/06/11/2f541350-69e8-11e8-bea7-c8eb28bc52b1_story.html?noredirect=on amp;utm_term=.f9f8295862e2) - *Michael O'Sullivan*  gt; It #8217;s been a long time coming for Incredibles 2, but the punchline is worth the setup [CBR](https://www.cbr.com/incredibles-2-movie-review-2018/) - *Meg Downey*  gt; Incredibles 2 is much more self aware, and artfully dodges a lot of the tired tropes associated with husband-wife role-swaps. [Screenrant](https://screenrant.com/incredibles-2-movie-reviews/) - *Molly Freeman*  gt; Incredibles 2 captures most of the fun of Pixar's The Incredibles, but feels somewhat outdated in the modern Hollywood landscape of superhero movies. [The Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/incredibles-2-review-1118342) - *Todd McCarthy*  gt; Incredible enough. [Entertainment Weekly](http://ew.com/movies/2018/06/11/incredibles-2-review/) - *Darren Franich*  gt; Incredibles 2 is a superheroic delight, and the weirdest Pixar movie ever. [IGN](http://www.ign.com/articles/2018/06/11/incredibles-2-review) - *David Griffin*  gt; Brad Bird #8217;s strong script and direction elevate this animated adventure to new heights. Instead of trying to copy or parody the superhero films of the past 14 years, Incredibles 2 embraces what made its first outing so memorable: The Parr family and their willingness to work together in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds. [Vox](https://www.vox.com/summer-movies/2018/6/11/17446668/incredibles-2-review-pixar-jack-jack) - *Alissa Wilkinson*  gt; Incredibles 2 is a fun sequel with a lot to say. Maybe too much.  gt; The Parr family is back for an enjoyable romp that sometimes groans under the weight of its Big Ideas. [Chicago Tribune](http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/sc-mov-incredibles-2-rev-0611-story.html) - *Michael Phillips*  gt;  #8220;Incredibles 2 #8221; is content to punch the clock and stick to straight, bombastic action mode. In that mode, composer Giacchino #8217;s music is the most successful element, running nimble, beautifully orchestrated variations on themes that feel familiar in the best ways while retaining their spark. The animation is bright and visually dynamic. The script, well  #8230; if the title were  #8220;Satisfactories 2, #8221; it #8217;d be about right. [Vanity Fair](https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/06/incredibles-2-review) - *Richard Lawson*  gt; Writer-director Brad Bird #8217;s sequel is sleek and sure-footed #8212;if a little square. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- **Description:** Everyone's favorite family of superheroes is back in "Incredibles 2"--but this time Helen (voice of Holly Hunter) is in the spotlight, leaving Bob (voice of Craig T. Nelson) at home with Violet (voice of Sarah Vowell) and Dash (voice of Huck Milner) to navigate the day-to-day heroics of "normal" life. It's a tough transistion for everyone, made tougher by the fact that the family is still unaware of baby Jack-Jack's emerging superpowers.

    <TITLE>Review Thread - 'Ant-Man and the Wasp'</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-06-27 18:09:34</DATE>
    <TEXT>Review embargo just lifted on Ant Man  amp; The Wasp a few minutes ago. Looking like a pretty fun, solid, generic, Summer-y Marvel flick. Not too bad I guess. Nobody really hates it or loves it. **Rotten Tomatoes**: [90%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/ant_man_and_the_wasp/) - 62 Reviews - 7.0 Average Rating **Metacritic**: [70](http://www.metacritic.com/movie/ant-man-and-the-wasp) **Rotten Tomatoes Critics Consensus:**  gt; A lighter, brighter superhero movie powered by the effortless charisma of Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lilly, Ant-Man and The Wasp offers a much-needed MCU palette cleanser. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- [LA Times](http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-ant-man-and-the-wasp-review-20180627-story.html) - *Justin Chang*  gt; 'Ant-Man and the Wasp' is a bright, cheery tonic from the Marvel superhero factory.

Set over the course of about two days in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, it #8217;s one of the most propulsive Marvel films to date. Director Peyton Reed #8217;s movie is also exciting, beautiful, funny, and heartfelt to boot. [Vanity Fair](https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/06/ant-man-and-the-wasp-review) - *Richard Lawson*  gt; The Marvel Universe explores its lightest side in this amiable sequel. [Variety](https://variety.com/2018/film/reviews/ant-man-and-the-wasp-review-paul-rudd-evangeline-lilly-1202858263/) -* Owen Gleiberman* - Possible Spoiler Warning  gt; Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lilly reunite in a tiny-superhero Marvel sequel that's faster, funnier, and more cunningly confident than the original. [IGN](http://www.ign.com/articles/2018/06/27/ant-man-and-the-wasp-review) - *Laura Prudom*  gt; Ant-Man and The Wasp doesn #8217;t have as much style as James Gunn #8217;s Guardians movies or Taika Waititi #8217;s Thor: Ragnarok, but returning director Peyton Reed has honed in on everything that made the first Ant-Man so charming and doubled down on it, from the offbeat humor to the zippy energy radiating from every scene. [Village Voice](https://www.villagevoice.com/2018/06/27/ant-man-and-the-wasp-is-no-ant-man/) - *Bilge Ebiri*  gt; It's disjointed, and cluttered, but it's also entertaining in spurts. Is that enough?

    <TEXT>**Description** In the first narrative feature from The Wolfpack director Crystal Moselle, Camille, an introverted teenage skateboarder (newcomer Rachelle Vinberg) from Long Island, meets and befriends an all-girl, New York City-based skateboarding crew called Skate Kitchen. She falls in with the in-crowd, has a falling-out with her mother, and falls for a mysterious skateboarder guy (Jaden Smith), but a relationship with him proves to be trickier to navigate than a kickflip. Writer/director Crystal Moselle immersed herself in the lives of the skater girls and worked closely with them, resulting in the film's authenticity, which combines poetic, atmospheric filmmaking and hypnotic skating sequences. SKATE KITCHEN precisely captures the experience of women in male-dominated spaces and tells a story of a girl who learns the importance of camaraderie and self-discovery. **Release Date:** August 10, 2018 **Rotten Tomatoes:** [100%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/skate_kitchen/)</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; In 1945, the sinking of Indianapolis led to the greatest single loss of life at sea, from a single ship, in the history of the US Navy. The ship had just finished a high-speed trip to United States Army Air Force Base at Tinian to deliver parts of Little Boy, the first nuclear weapon ever used in combat, and was on her way to the Philippines on training duty. At 0015 on 30 July 1945 the ship was torpedoed by the Imperial Japanese Navy submarine I-58, and sank in 12 minutes. Of 1,195 crewmen aboard, approximately 300 went down with the ship. The remaining 900 faced exposure, dehydration, saltwater poisoning, and shark attacks while floating with few lifeboats and almost no food or water. The Navy learned of the sinking when survivors were spotted four days later by the crew of a PV-1 Ventura on routine patrol. Only 316 survived.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Okay so I saw this today and finally had time to gather my thoughts. This started off real great. I liked that the opening scene was kind of parallel to the original's bomb opening scene. It felt a bit played-for-shock but it worked. I liked the 'do whatever it takes Bearded-Brolin' in Africa. That was fucking cool. The 'let's start a cartel war' idea could've worked well if they stuck with it. I honestly thought this was going to be the whole movie. I thought the lawyer assassination/Isabel kidnapping were going to be the first two steps but that kind of just ended their. They completely dropped the 'rogue mercenaries start a rogue cartel war' and went with 'Brolin stuck in a bureaucratic mess while Del Toro stars in *Logan Lite*'. So, that sucks. So much potential wasted there IMO. One big thing I don't understand, who attacked the convoy when they were bringing back Isabel to Mexico? Who were paying off the cops to attack them? How would Carlos Reyez's rivals even know about the exchange and why would they even try to attack the convoy? Wouldn't they be protected as fuck when going back into Mexico because one of the big cartel bosses (Carlos Reyez) really wanted his daughter back? Wouldn't he do anything to get her back? I feel like he would send a thousand guys to escort them. After that battle, when Del Toro goes after the girl. Why wouldn't they bring in a helicopter right away? Why did he have to travel back to the border by car/foot? They had already used/will use helicopters in Mexico so that whole mission seemed unnecessary. The last 1/3 of the movie felt pointless when it could have been solved with common sense. They would've been extracted before we even got to Catherine Keener's 'clean up everything' part of the movie (which was fucking dumb by the way). Just call in the extraction as soon as you find her (which was apparently 5 minutes later because the injured guy was just driving by her randomly, and couldn't have gotten very far on foot. Brolin could've just picked them up by car at this point). I fucking hate that they turned Brolin  amp; Del Toro against each other. I felt like this spit in the face of the original film. They didn't stick to Del Toro dying, and they didn't stick to Brolin 'cutting all ties'. Why even introduce these problems if you're not going to stick with them? Felt sloppy. The 'surprise, Benicio is still alive' thing was so obvious and dumb. Either keep him alive and don't shoot him in the face, or shoot him in the face and let him die. Feels like a completely cop out for him to come back to life. Also, he wakes up and suddenly he's right next to the cars with the dead bodies? They were so far away by then (after a fucking helicopter chase) there's no way he would have made it all the way to those cars. They'd be dozens of miles away by then most likely. Just some annoying stuff too like when Brolin is on his way to rescue/kill Del Toro and they're '10 minutes away' and it's pitch-black-middle-of-the-night. By the time they get their it's as bright as middle of the day. I feel like Villeneuve wouldn't have made that mistake. It's obviously a mistake too because as soon as he wakes up the helicopters pass over him. Which means he was unconscious for a grand total of 10 minutes after being shot in the face? Come on. The ending, ugh. I actually laughed out loud during the 'One Year Later' scene. It was so cheesy/stereotypical/sequel-baiting. Fuck outta here. I thought he would move away from that lifestyle after he jumped out of the truck. Didn't he do that because he regretted it? I guess not. (What's the point of him jumping out of the truck then? Except keeping a shitty, uninteresting, stereotypical character on for a sequel?). Next time we seem him he's a full gangster with spooky tattoos and the cholo outfit. I hate when movies do obvious sequel baiting like that. Make the movie speak for itself and then let's see what happens (*looks at Sicario*). Also, we get to see what happens to Del Toro but not Brolin/Isabel? Felt kind of incomplete. Why would the girl even want to go back to the US/witness protection? Why are the boy's friends trying to kidnap her also? What do they even care about her? Also, what's up with her mother? She was mentioned a few times but it felt super random. Not to mention the "hey, let's just randomly meet up about this top-secret mission in a mall food court at the same time the kid that will identify us later is here for a random delivery". It's just way too convenient. Cut out the fake-cholo kid. Cut out most of the Isabel kidnapping. Just have them return her after a small battle or whatever. Then go back to the 'starting a rogue cartel war' part of the movie. The whole last third had me scratching my head like "none of this needs to be happening right now, this is so dumb". I went it in with the lowest expectations and was still extremely disappointed and let down. Also come on, this should've been titled *Soldado*. This is a really low 4/10. Shameful sequel to one of my favorite movies of 2016. This is kind of a rambling review but I'm already starting to forget it, while some scenes in the original are still clear as day. Off topic but my audience didn't help either. Old people in the front talking loud as shit, literally reading out subtitles, then kids in the back laughing/taking pictures. Just a shitty experience overall. Let's not greenlight a 3rd movie please.</TEXT>

It's a really close call between the top 3 but I'll give the edge to Wes Anderson's *Rushmore*. I had put this off for a long time but it was a really fun/easy watch. You can see all the classic Wes Anderson-y type things in it, but they hadn't been clearly refined yet. That was pretty refreshing. I also liked all the references to his upcoming film, *Life Aquatic*.</TEXT>

You posted both stories first but the posts right after you are getting the traction each time because of the thumbnail. Yesterday I posted the Star Wars news right after you and I had 200+ upvotes and 90 comments, you had 20+ upvotes and 4 comments. Same thing today when /u/gavingunhold posted right after you. He had like 5x the upvotes and comments. The mods (probably the same person both times cause it doesn't make sense, maybe one of the newer mods I guess) kept yours both times and it killed the stories.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I really liked it. One of the best trio of performances this year (worth the ticket price just for this). I watch a decent amount of lesbian/gay films but that just comes with the territory of watching ~170 movies a year in theaters lol. It's not like a favorite genre of mine or anything. It's definitely got a unique/different vibe because of the religious tension hanging over everything during the movie. It's much more layered than your typical romance-drama. Definitely worth a redbox rental or something.</TEXT>

For every life there is a death, and for every person there is an itch that only the few scratch; the dark voice that tells people to blow out the flame of another #8217;s life. You might walk down a street and brush shoulders with a stranger and exchange a polite smile, completely unaware that stranger is picturing themselves stood above your bleeding body as you draw your final breath. There is a place for those people. They have all killed, they all think about killing, some want to stop, some want to talk and some just need to listen. Huh, okay I guess.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2018-07-13 00:57:49</DATE>
    <TEXT>Review embargo just lifted on *Mission Impossible: Fallout*. It's getting insanely good reviews across the board, might be the best film in the series. Some are even saying it's one of the best actions films of the decade. The hype will be real. **Rotten Tomatoes**: [97%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/mission_impossible_fallout/) - 8.6 Average Rating - 39 Reviews **Metacritic**: [85](http://www.metacritic.com/movie/mission-impossible-fallout) - *Metacritic Must-See* **Rotten Tomatoes Critics Consensus:**  gt; Fast, sleek, and fun, Mission: Impossible - Fallout lives up to the "impossible" part of its name by setting yet another high mark for insane set pieces in a franchise full of them.  gt; ---------------------------------------------------------------------- [Entertainment Weekly](http://ew.com/movies/2018/07/12/mission-impossible-fallout-review/) - *Chris Nashawaty*  gt; It #8217;s the kind of pure, straight-no-chaser pop fun that not only keeps taking your breath away over and over again, it restores your occasionally shaky faith in summer blockbusters [The Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/mission-impossible-fallout-review-spectacular-eye-popping/) - *Tim Robey*  gt; OK, McQuarrie may not have De Palma #8217;s sweat-drop precision, John Woo #8217;s craziness or the impish wit of Brad Bird, but his mastery of logistics here is easily sufficient to make it the blockbuster of the summer. [Uproxx](https://uproxx.com/movies/mission-impossible-fallout-review/) - *Mike Ryan*  gt; Simply put, Mission: Impossible  #8211; Fallout is the best action movie you will see this year. You #8217;ll probably leave the theater overcome with an urge to go jumping from building to building. [IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/2018/07/mission-impossible-fallout-review-tom-cruise-best-action-movie-1201983552/) - *David Ehrlich*  gt; He #8217;s only Tom Cruise because nobody else is willing to be  #8212; or maybe he #8217;s only Tom Cruise so that nobody else has to be. Either way, Fallout is the film he #8217;s always promised us, and it was totally worth the wait [Total Film](https://www.gamesradar.com/mission-impossible-fallout-review/) - *Jamie Graham*  gt; McQuarrie brings grace and grit, and Cruise brings it, period. This quick-witted, fleet-footed franchise shows no sign of flagging. [Variety](https://variety.com/2018/film/reviews/mission-impossible-fallout-review-1202872043/) - *Peter Debruge* - Possible Spoilers  gt; McQuarrie clearly believes in creating coherent set pieces: His combat scenes are tense, muscular, and clean, shot and edited in such a way that the spatial geography makes sense. He places audiences just over Cruise #8217;s shoulder, or staring into the actor #8217;s face as he grimaces with exertion. [TheWrap](https://www.thewrap.com/mission-impossible-fallout-cruise-ing-bruising-action-jam-packed-six-quel/) - *Robert Abele*  gt; At nearly two and a half hours, it #8217;s designed to test your patience for the things that matter in these movies  #8212; violent confrontation, deception, jokey camaraderie, and over-the-top action  #8212; but it does so with a remarkably re-engaged fluidity of purpose. [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/12/17566014/mission-impossible-fallout-review-tom-cruise) - *Bryan Bishop*  gt; Mission: Impossible - Fallout merges the franchise #8217;s big-budget spectacle with an utterly ferocious style of action filmmaking that far surpasses what McQuarrie executed in either Rogue Nation or Jack Reacher. [The Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/mission-impossible-fallout-review-1126693) - *Todd McCarthy*  gt; Even as the narrative becomes more perplexing  #8212; as before, realistic masks conceal true identities, characters' actual agendas remain hidden  #8212; the fast-moving spectacle unfolds in extraordinary fashion. [Vanity Fair](https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/07/mission-impossible-fallout-tom-cruise-movie-review) - *Richard Lawson*  gt; In ragged times, the sophisticated derring-do of Fallout is a welcome gift, a slick and studio-polished adventure that nonetheless has the undermining wink of transgression. The movie #8217;s nerve and moxie successfully make us forget its corporate overlords, and all those other oligarchs grinding millions of American lives into nothing. [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jul/12/mission-impossible-fallout-review-tom-cruise-remains-a-pneumatic-treat) - *Peter Bradshaw*  gt; Over two-and-a-half hours, you get a lot of deafening bangs for your buck, and the tourist location stunts are impressive - but there isn #8217;t as much humour in the dialogue as before. [The Playlist](https://theplaylist.net/mission-impossible-fallout-review-20180712/) - *Kimber Myers*  gt; There #8217;s a delirious joy in watching this much action, this well executed at every level [The Film Stage](https://thefilmstage.com/reviews/review-mission-impossible-fallout-represents-a-manifesto-for-breathtaking-high-stakes-action/) - *Conor O'Donnell*  gt; McQuarrie has proven himself such a keen purveyor of large-scale cinema that not only solidifies Fallout as a benchmark for the franchise, but a bona fide manifesto for breathtaking, high-stakes action #8211;a mission that the genre as a whole would do well to accept. [Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/mission-impossible-fallout-review-tom-cruise-stunts-white-widow-henry-cavill-a8445736.html) - *Christopher Hooton*  gt; Franchise-best stunts let down by convoluted plot. Tom Cruise's latest stunt display is jaw-dropping, but the star is surrounded by a dreary set of supporting characters. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- **Description:** When an IMF mission ends badly and Solomon Lane escapes custody, the world is faced with dire consequences. As Ethan Hunt takes it upon himself to fulfill his original briefing, the CIA begins to question his loyalty and his motives. Hunt finds himself in a race against time, hunted by assassins and former allies while trying to prevent a global catastrophe. **Release Date:** July 27, 2018 **Starring:** * Tom Cruise * Henry Cavill * Rebecca Ferguson * Ving Rhames * Simon Pegg * Sean Harris * Angela Bassett * Michelle Monaghan * Alec Baldwin * Vanessa Kirby **Producers:** Tom Cruise, JJ Abrams, David Ellison, Christopher McQuarrie **Running Time:** 147 Minutes **Director:** Christopher McQuarrie ('Jack Reacher', 'MI: Rogue Nation', 'The Way Of The Gun')</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Nah it's a rule. You can't have an opinion/accolade/insult or whatever in the title. It's too clickbaity and reactionary. Then you'd get conflicting titles too. "Mission Impossibe: Fallout Review" would be allowed. "Mission Impossible: Fallout is the greatest movie of all time and I cried tears of joy" would be removed. That goes for any movie not just the big ones. The big ones get more traction early though so they get noticed/removed faster.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Her statement:  gt;  #8220;In light of recent ethical questions raised surrounding my casting as Dante Tex Gill, I have decided to respectfully withdraw my participation in the project, #8221; Johansson told Out Magazine, which first reported the news, in a statement.  #8220;Our cultural understanding of transgender people continues to advance, and I #8217;ve learned a lot from the community since making my first statement about my casting and realize it was insensitive. I have great admiration and love for the trans community and am grateful that the conversation regarding inclusivity in Hollywood continues. According to GLAAD, LGBTQ+ characters dropped 40% in 2017 from the previous year, with no representation of trans characters in any major studio release. #8221;  gt;  #8220;While I would have loved the opportunity to bring Dante #8217;s story and transition to life, I understand why many feel he should be portrayed by a transgender person, and I am thankful that this casting debate, albeit controversial, has sparked a larger conversation about diversity and representation in film, #8221; the statement continues.  #8220;I believe that all artists should be considered equally and fairly. My production company, These Pictures, actively pursues projects that both entertain and push boundaries. We look forward to working with every community to bring these most poignant and important stories to audiences worldwide. #8221;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For sure, one of the best performances of that year, can't take that away from it. It's definitely a solid, well-built film that reinvigorated the genre. There's absolutely an argument for top 3 or 5 of that year but calling it an all-time best just feels like recency bias  amp; Nolan-worship to me. There's no way it's anything close to top 100. But it's reddit so yeah it's probably the best film of all time.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In theaters I watched **Leave No Trace** (9/10), **Three Identical Strangers** (7/10), **Sorry To Bother You** (5/10), and **Skyscraper** (3/10). At home I watched **12 Angry Men** (9/10), **The Big Chill** (7/10), **The Darjeeling Limited** (7/10), and **Easy Rider** (6/10). The highlight this week was Debra Granik's **Leave No Trace**. Just a great, grounded, realistic modern-drama that explores mental illness, homelessness, coming-of-age, and all that good stuff in a beautiful setting. The film looked *insanely* good. I love me a dense-forest setting. The two leads are perfect, Thomasin McKenzie puts in the best debut performance of the year. She's gonna be huge. It takes turns you don't expect and I love that it doesn't end on a particularly good note. It would've been easy for Granik to take the easy way out but she doesn't. Looking forward to watching this one again. Although I'm kind of pissed, I missed the first 10-15 minutes because my theater decided not to run trailers in front of it for some random reason. That sucked.</TEXT>

Description:  gt; The film is an original action-fantasy dramatization of ancient Tibetan mythology, with a vast set of characters occupying different heavenly realms. Leo Wu plays the film's hero, a young boy who must embark on an epic journey to save Asura, the heavenly dimension of pure desire after it is threatened by a coup from a lower kingdom. Veteran Hong Kong actors Tony Ka Fai Leung and Carina Lau also star as mythical demigods.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That wasn't a release. Those were test screenings. That's super common and happens with a bunch of movies. This is a completely different scenario. The film had a wide release across the country, it's getting pulled after 3 days and edited. That just doesn't happen.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Looks like it never got off the ground and was recently cancelled. Shame.  gt;  #8220;So our idea was to literally pick that movie up but 30 years later and kind of do a version of Unforgiven, where there #8217;s something going on and Conan is not the strongest guy he used to be, he #8217;s not the legend he used to be; he #8217;s an old, broken guy. And this thing comes down to where now he #8217;s got to find a reason to go on and find a different way to fight other than just with brute strength. It was a great movie that just gave validation to even at the end of someone #8217;s life there #8217;s real value to them. I don #8217;t know, it was so great, Arnold Schwarzenegger loved it.  gt;  gt;  #8220;I think at the end of the day it was just probably too expensive, too big, and to the studio ultimately it wasn #8217;t in the cards for them. So now it #8217;s kind of out and I think they #8217;re looking elsewhere to do like maybe a TV show or something else with it. But that was my interest, just to tell that one story, but you never know, down the road we #8217;ll see what happens. #8221;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Also, first synopsis just released:  gt;  #8220;In Alfonso Cuar #243;n #8217;s autobiographically inspired film, set in Mexico City in the early  #8217;70s, we are placed within the physical and emotional terrain of a middle-class family whose center is quietly and unassumingly held by its beloved live-in nanny and housekeeper (Yalitza Aparicio). The cast is uniformly magnificent, but the real star of  #8216;ROMA #8217; is the world itself, fully present and vibrantly alive, from sudden life-changing events to the slightest shifts in mood and atmosphere. Cuar #243;n tells us an epic story of everyday life while also gently sweeping us into a vast cinematic experience, in which time and space breathe and majestically unfold. Shot in breathtaking black and white and featuring a sound design that represents something new in the medium,  #8216;ROMA #8217; is a truly visionary work. #8221;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Update: Just finished watching this in a theater. I really enjoyed it. It's just a unique view of the apocalypse in an overdone zombie genre. It's more gather  amp; survive than 'fight zombies'. I really liked that about it (although I wouldn't really watch a trilogy on it or anything lol). I loved how organized he was and some really great attention he paid to detail. Like when he clears out that apartment with the family of 3 zombies. He doesn't just open the door, he makes a little hole and guns them down. Most movies wouldn't think about that I think. Even though I knew alive-Sarah was fake, I kind of hoped she wouldn't have been. Maybe introduce her in a more realistic way (like, why would she come running in the middle on the night lol?), then have her die off tragically before he makes his grand escape. Something like that would have worked better for me. Also, I don't like how this movie couldn't decide whether the zombies were attracted to sound or sight. Just pick one and stick with it. It felt like they flip-flopped on that a bunch. Solid 7/10 for me. Although I'd rather they'd have been french-speaking characters if you're gonna set the thing in Paris. I loved the existential-crisis-filled dread ending note that the movie finished on. Oh and I absolutely thought it was going to end with him stuck in that elevator at the end, having lost his gun so he had to way to kill himself. Basically switching spots with Alfred, he became the caged animal. Holy shit I would've absolutely loved that or despised it. Not sure which. But yeah solid overall. Also, 30% Audience Score on Rotten Tomatoes. Are you fucking kidding me?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For sure, that elevator scene was the highlight of the movie for me. Almost made me a bit claustrophobic for him lol. I 100% expected a black screen and end credits as soon as the hands start reaching out.  gt; I absolutely loved how the zombies were quiet. Sameeee. The quiet/slow zombie is my favorite. Makes for a more atmospherically-deadful movie. The 4 other people in my audience kind of scoffed at the ending but I loved it. He's completely exhausted, injured, hallucinating, and it's just like "1 roof down, 5000 to go" and his relieved smile just goes away lol.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, hence the 'mostly'. The Snowman, Alien Covenant, Song to Song, Assasin's Creed, The Light Between Oceans, Trepass Against Us, The Counselor, and X-Men Apocalypse were all Sub-par/weak/trash. MacBeth is questionable, and Dark Phoenix looks like it'll be a mess.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah most weren't terrible, just disappointing and landed below-expectations. He just had insane hype coming off of Hunger, Shame, First Class, Fish Tank, 300, and Inglorious Basterds that never really materialized farther than an inconsistent, disappointing filmography at best.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Two all-time classics. *The Seven Samurai* is up there in the greatest films of all time conversation. It's actually pretty crazy that a Kurosawa screenwriter was still alive in 2018. He also wrote *The Magnificent Seven*, *I Want to Be a Shellfish*, *Harakiri*, *Japan's Longest Day*, and 70+ other films. One of the most accomplished screenwriters ever. Kept writing into his 90s. He also wrote *The Hidden Fortress*, which was a major influence for George Lucas' *Star Wars* series. Absolute legend.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's Netflix's most expense film so far with a $125M budget (although *The Irishman* will probably pass that when it's all said and done). Not much info about the movie yet except:  gt; "Reynolds will lead a team of four men and two women on a mission to stop evil. Reynolds plays operative codenamed  #8216;One #8217; while Franco will play  #8216;Six #8217; if he closes the deal."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's San Diego Comic Con. It is the single biggest weekend of the year for movie related news/casting/buzz/trailers/posters/etc. Millions of people care about these movies and this is the biggest movie forum in the world. Obviously they will be upvoted. There can be hundreds/thousands of comments within minutes. That's not done by bots lol. Movie trailers/posters aren't just popular on reddit, man. They're pretty big everywhere else too. Are you seriously asking why a discussion self-post about Kenneth Branragh's Much Ado About Nothing is not as popular as the brand new Aquaman trailer? The only possible answers are 'people love ads' and 'must be bots'? No, people just like popular things. Sometimes discussions make it to the top, it's not like it never happens either.</TEXT>

One of my local Regal theaters used to give them away when you gave money to the Regal charity thing. I would give a couple bucks and grab a nice, full sized, official poster. They stopped doing it though, really sucks. Really happy I got *Baby Driver*  amp; *Song to Song* for $2 each lol.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In theaters I watched *The Cakemaker* (7/10), *The Night Eats The World* (7/10), and *Don't Worry He Won't Get Far On Foot* (4/10). At home I watched *Paths Of Glory* (10/10) and *Shallow Grave* (6/10). It was my first time watching *Paths of Glory* and I was absolutely blown away. It's my first 10/10 in a while. It immediately joins *Thin Red Line* as my favorite war (anti-war in this case) films ever. The score, the direction, the set design, the camera work (especially during the battle scene) are all perfect. Kirk Douglas kills it in this role. One of the best final scenes in recent memory. Mindblowing that this movie was made 61 years ago, it's aged magnificently. Side note, *Don't Worry He Won't Get Far On Foot* will go down as one of this year's biggest disappointments. Everything was so disconnected and the dark humor (being generous calling it humor) completely felt flat. I'm always so underwhelmed by Gus Van Sant films. Only highlight was Jonah Hill giving an Oscar-Nomination-worthy performance IMO.</TEXT>

Equipped with the almost-obsolete Hurricane and (with some initial reluctance) given RAF blue uniforms, while they fought, Poland lived. **Release Date:** Unknown, 2018</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Amazon Studios Sucks at Releasing Movies.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-07-22 23:49:35</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I went to near-empty opening day screening of *Don't Worry He Won't Get Far On Foot* and got to thinking recently about how bad Amazon Studios has been at promoting/releasing their movies. Other than *Manchester By The Sea*  amp; *The Big Sick*, it seems like every movie they release, even the critically-acclaimed ones, completely go under-the-radar and flop at the box office. They never get talked out and I think its Amazon's fault. They just pick one movie to push for that season and drop everything else. Movies like *Lost City of Z*, *Last Flag Flying*, *You Were Never Really Here*, *Wonderstruck*, *Landline*, *The Salesman*, *Paterson* were all great and did well with critics/audiences but never got the release they deserved. None of these ever went much farther than 100 theaters. Their movies just never expand/build buzz. It's weird for a company/studio with such deep pockets. You never see ads anywhere for them. Even Netflix will buy a few TV spots (*Cloverfield Paradox*, *Okja*, *Meyerowitz Stories*, etc) sometimes and they don't even release in theaters. Even *The Handmaiden*, arguably their best film ever, only maxed out at about 100 theaters and flopped in the US. It got 0 promotion and that should've gotten a huge push during that year's awards season. I'm thinking the same thing might happen this year with *Beautiful Boy*, *Cold War*, *Suspiria*, and *Life Itself*. It's a real shame that they seem to prioritize the online release over the theatrical release with most of their films and I think a lot of their films suffer because of it. They just can't seem to keep movies in theaters or expand them at all.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Joe Wright reuniting with Gary Oldman so soon is awesome. Throw in Amy Adams, a Tracy Letts script, and an awards-season release date and you've got yourself crazy potential.  gt; With a nod to the Alfred Hitchcock classic Rear Window, the book centers on a child psychologist with severe agoraphobia (and a penchant for mixing alcohol with her medication) who hasn #8217;t left her house in months. The woman witnesses a horrible crime involving a new neighboring family but no one, including the police, will believe her. And she has doubts herself.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; Stoned Alone is reminiscent of that hallowed comedy classic. It centers around a twenty-something weed growing loser who misses the plane for his holiday ski trip. He makes the best of things by getting high. Paranoia sets in and he believes he hears someone break into his house. Turns out thieves have broken in. Fully stoned and fueled by paranoia, he tries to thwart the thieves and defend his castle. Lol I guess it's one of those 'so crazy it might work' things, like most of Ryan Reynolds' upcoming movies (I'm looking at you, *Detective Pikachu*  amp; *Clue*). I bet he ends up starring in this too.</TEXT>

Sounds pretty good too.  gt; In  #8220;gen:Lock, #8221; Earth #8217;s last free society is on the losing side of a global war. Jordan provides the voice of Julian Chase, the first rebel pilot to step forward for the gen:Lock program, while Fanning plays an expert mech pilot and Chase #8217;s love interest. Yamadera, a longtime anime voice actor, plays a recruit who transfers from Japan #8217;s military forces to fight alongside Chase.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I fucking loved *Blindspotting*. This combined with *Eighth Grade* today was my favorite double-header in a while. Diggs  amp; Casal had the perfect chemistry for this. It kept a perfect balance of comedy, drama, and social issues. The rap bits could've easily been cheesy but they were all excellent. This is gonna get overshadowed by *Sorry To Bother You* for being (kind-of, but not really, the comparison is stupid) similar, but this is by far the better film IMO. "Fuck Alfred Hitchcock!" and "She was so tall she had 2 pairs of kneecaps" were so goddamn funny. The response to "That drink will be $10" was hilarious. Val  amp; Diggs' relationship was actually believable. The courtroom scene, the kid-holding-gun scene, the party fight, uber-opening, final confrontation, the flashback of the fight, "same tattoo" bit, etc. So many standout scenes. I laughed so hard when they called the dude Topher Grace, Neil Patrick Harris, etc. I'm watching this again, 100%. Such a fun script, fresh direction.</TEXT>

It's deader than usual because the Ving Rhames post from last night stayed up longer than it should have and killed off this sub's r/all exposure for a while. Made even worse because Saturday's are the slowest news days for /r/movies  amp; /r/television. * Posters do pretty well. Much better than trailers and 'first images'. I posted a trailer of this movie yesterday and it got 5 upvotes in 12 hours. * It's got a reddit-favorite (Hugo Weaving) and an interesting premise. * There's nothing else going on. Check out the /r/new queue lol. TL;DR - Title is good, content is decent, timing is perfect. It's not always a conspiracy.</TEXT>

Pretty comparable post-Twilight careers but I definitely give the edge to Pattinson. Both are looking to have really good 2019s though. But yeah I agree this sub shits on Kristen Stewart at every opportunity.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>First off, the chemistry that Diggs  amp; Casal have together is incredible. I'd watch 5 hours of them just talking shit to each other. The boat selling scene, hair salon scene, courtroom dream scene, uber scene, kid-holding-gun scene. So many standout scenes. I laughed so goddamn hard at "Fuck Alfred Hitchcock!" and that completely random "she was so tall she had 2 sets of kneecaps". I love when they're in the flashback and they keep calling the white guy Neil Patrick Harris, Topher Grace, etc. That was hilarious. Just super enjoyable  amp; refreshing. I loved how they didn't go with a downer ending when they could easily have done it. This is one of my favorite films of the year, probably top 10 so far. Digg's final confrontation/rap/monologue was one of the most intense scenes I've seen in a while. I really didn't expect to love it so much going in. Really surprisingly well-done considering it's also a directorial debut. You can tell the director came from music videos because it felt like one at times, in a good way. The relationships are all super believable and you actually feel committed to them. The script really feels like it was written by the two main characters, if that makes any sense. It was a perfect balance of comedy  amp; drama. Fun time, always keeps you off balance.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I actually gave up figuring the plot out halfway into it. Awesome movie, unnecessarily convoluted plot IMO. From what I understand, Lark wants the plutonium, The Apostles just want Lane back. They aren't exactly the same group. * -Lark wants to change the world, get rid of the old order, blah blah blah. He needs plutonium. * -The Apostles want Lane back. They need someone to break him out (for some reason they can't do it themselves?...) * -The Apostles steal plutonium as a trade chip that they know they can exchange for Lane. They approach White Widow and say "we have plutonium, find us someone that can break out our buddy Lane". (Even though White Widow could've easily done it with her own guys. The break-out mission is basically 20 White Widow dudes + Ethan/Henry Cavill). * -Lark arranges a deal to meet with White Widow so they can work out a deal for the plutonium (AKA break Lane out to exchange him for the plutonium). * -This is when Ethan jumps in and poses as Lark. He kidnaps Lane, now wants to get plutonium back using fake-Simon-Pegg-Lane, so he can control both Lane  amp; the plutonium. * -Chaos ensues. There are so many ways where this could easily have been made easier but then the movie becomes 90 minutes shorter. It was overcomplicated for no reason. Even after all that, Lane just wants to commit suicide with the bombs (what??? why???). That doesn't make sense. I feel like White Widow became expendable during the deal and they could have just skipped over her completely. On the other hand, the Lane kidnapping could've worked with just White Widow's henchmen too so even Lark/Ethan being involved doesn't make sense. The Apostles could've just bought his escape.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In theaters I saw *Blindspotting* (8/10), *Mission Impossible: Fallout* (8/10), *Eighth Grade* (8/10), and *The Catcher Was A Spy* (2/10). At home I watched *Beyond The Hills* (9/10), La Cineaga (7/10), and Rumble Fish (4/10). It's a close call between *Blindspotting*  amp; *Beyond The Hills*, but the edge goes to the latter. It's a really bleak, slow, religious drama and I have a thing for those. Cristian Mungiu has become one of my favorite current directors recently and this is probably the best film I've seen of his. He just has a unique way of putting you in the middle of a situation, almost like every conversation is happening in your living room. It feels almost like a documentary or real-life video. The actors are all relative-unknowns but they all play their part beautifully. This movie's ending is just a beautiful punch to the gut. Now I just need Criterion to release *4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days*. Side note, holy shit *The Catcher Was A Spy* is so bad.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; Directed by Panos Cosmatos and starring Nicholas Cage, the film follows Cage #8217;s character in an effort to track down the cult-like group responsible for the murder of his wife. In a press release about the film, Cosmatos writes,  #8220;J #243;hann went above and beyond, and I suspect to the limits of his sanity, to make the music for this movie. His words and his actions made him more than a great collaborator, they made him like a brother to me. I #8217;m sad our time together was so brief but I #8217;m very proud of what he accomplished on Mandy and I believe he was too. #8221; [97% on Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/mandy_2018/) after 32 reviews. Great buzz out of every festival it's been at. This gon' be good.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Highly disagree. Such a boring waste of a great cast. Nothing really happens and everything is so fake. There's no way 90% of what happens is even remotely accurate. I love spy-dramas, I love WW2 films, and I love the cast, but this was such a letdown. The real story is pretty interesting, and the dude's life should make a great film. This was not that. Not a single redeeming factor. Even the setpieces are weak and the script is completely lifeless. I laughed out loud at the scene when Paul Rudd randomly starts running down the hallway for absolutely no reason.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Wasn't a super big fan of *Bone Tomahawk*  amp; *Brawl In Cell Block 99*.  gt; Two policemen, one an old-timer (Mel Gibson), the other his volatile younger partner (Vince Vaughn), find themselves suspended when a video of their strong-arm tactics become the media's cause du jour. Low on cash and with no other options, these two embittered soldiers descend into the criminal underworld to gain their just due, but instead find far more than they wanted awaiting them in the shadows. This sounds fun tho.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This was fantastic. Let's give Bo another directing gig soon, ya? The 'Truth or Dare' scene was the most uncomfortable scene in a movie this year, by far. I loved it. The pool scene  amp; end dinner scene were highlights. I laughed so goddamn hard during the banana sequence. "I'm pretty sure I made a note somewhere that you hate bananas" might as well be the best-delivered line in the history of cinema. I love that the father-of-the-year keeps taking beatings but he just never goes down. Really wholesome stuff in this, mixed in with some insanely cringy self-relflection moments that make you almost want to cry about your own middle school experience. Elsie Fisher could easily be up for awards if this wasn't released in July. Gabe was awesome. Although I did think it missed a 'punch', that something like *Lady Bird*  amp; *Call Me By Your Name* have.The campfire Father/Daughter talk scene went for it but didn't quite get there in my opinion, even though I really wanted it do. There was definitely a Michael Stuhlbarg-like presence/performance needed for that scene to break through. Best directorial debut of the year by a mile. Elsie Fisher is the breakout star of the summer, insane performance. Every second felt real. Felt more like a documentary than a movie at times. I love that they kept her dialogue real, like her lines were actually written by her, and not by Academy-award winning screenwriter or something. Some coming-of-age films are almost Sorkin-like, no teenager would ever talk like that. That feels like a weird compliment but it's true. I can see myself going to watch this again next week. Best coming-of-age film since *Lady Bird*. Bo deserves a lot of praise.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's awesome  amp; unexpected. I believe in Noah Hawley. Awesome to finally get some details about season 4.  gt; Fargo season 4 will shift the start of the action from the rural upper Midwest to Kansas City, Mo. and will take place in 1950.  gt;  gt; In 1950, at the end of two great American migrations  #8212; that of Southern Europeans from countries like Italy, who came to the US at the turn of the last century and settled in northern cities like New York, Chicago  #8212; and African Americans who left the south in great numbers to escape Jim Crow and moved to those same cities  #8212; you saw a collision of outsiders, all fighting for a piece of the American dream. In Kansas City, Missouri, two criminal syndicates have struck an uneasy peace. One Italian, one African American. Together they control an alternate economy  #8212; that of exploitation, graft and drugs. This too is the history of America. To cement their peace, the heads of both families have traded their eldest sons. That sounds fucking great.</TEXT>

The story also includes a female samurai named Lady Mariko,  #8220;a woman with invaluable skills but dishonorable family ties, who must prove her value and allegiance". Alright, I'm down.</TEXT>

Edit: Fun fact from /u/Binodash in /r/boxoffice: It took only 10 days to make $400,000,000 but it took 63 days to make the last $1,000,000.</TEXT>

The film has already been in production for two years, but Suzuki also told Anime News Network that the studio is doing things in How Do You Live? that it could not do before. So it'll be about 5-6 years total production time. I have a feeling it'll be worth the wait. Will probably be his final film.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Why such an asshole today Mozart? Unless public opinion has shifted without me realizing it, a comment praising Shia Laboeuf isn't karmawhoring. It's probably the opposite. Most people don't like him and he gets shit on in this sub a lot. Criticizing him would've probably gone better if karmawhoring was the goal. "mostly movie posters and new images" is a blatant fucking lie. I post absolutely everything and anything movie related (and you probably know that, I have you tagged as a Regular). I probably post them just as commonly as general news, casting, release dates, etc. Just dismissing it as some 'karmawhore' posts is just as lazy as my 'uninspired' comment. It's basically not possible to karmawhore link in this sub like any of the other huge subs, the rules are too strict and the mods are on point. What's a one-dimensional /r/movies post? I don't understand that part.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; writing "HOT TAKE" is about as safe as you can get, all that's missing is "I know I'll get downvoted for this BUT" I get calling out 'HOT TAKE' if that's what the entire comment is. But it's not, I added in my opinion and added to the conversation. I also commented like 5 other times in this thread? It's not like I came in, said 'HOT TAKE', collected my 12 karma and left. I've also posted dozens of Labeouf-related threads on this sub if that's worth anything. (it's not, but come on lol this is stupid)  gt; Funny how it's always links to stuff that will get upvoted to the top but never submitted discussion threads that could promote some interesting discussion, prob because the former will earn you more karma. Glass houses, brah. What in-depth discussions are you posting? There's absolutely nothing wrong with posting relevant news  amp; media  amp; trivia to the sub. Somebody's gonna do it anyways, so why can't I? I've posted probably 5000+ posts to this sub in the past year and a half. 98% of those don't get to the top but I still post them. You think none of those spawned any interesting discussions? Hundreds of thousands of comments all for nothing? Should I maybe post and "Man of UNCLE Recommendation Thread" or "Who else thinks Ratatouille is the great animated film of all time? Thread" in between the articles/news next time so you don't get angry?  gt; low effort comments. 9 times out of 10 I rarely ever see you give an in-depth comments. sometimes I even wonder if you actually even care or are interested about the stuff you post here. I participate in more of my own threads than any other regular poster does in theirs, by far. I try to make my comments as informative as possible, to spawn even more discussion. I've seen 150+ movies in theaters in the past year so most movies I post about are movies that I've seen/will see.  gt; maybe your efforts are sincere though I've seen plenty of other people here who do the same but actually add something to the table and post on other subreddits like /r/truefilm, /r/criterion, etc. I'm a pretty regular poster on /r/criterion. I even posted [my collection](https://www.reddit.com/r/criterion/comments/90bhyd/criterion_collection_movie_corner/) there a month ago and my [B amp;N sale pickups](https://www.reddit.com/r/criterion/comments/8uwxl7/criterion_sale_success/) on another post. I've been a mod on /r/boxoffice for almost 5 years. I browse /r/dvdcollection, /r/moviescirclejerk, etc daily. What do I have to prove to you lol?  gt; Must be why half of the top submissions are from this week are from you Yes, I post a lot. More than anyone else. I know that. That's not a secret and I don't get why that would be a criticism. Which of those are shitty karmawhore-type posts that you're criticizing me for though? I like to think that I post quality stuff and that adds to the sub. Yeah I got like 4M karma in this sub, but you seem to care more than me. -------------------------------------- I get that it's super easy to dismiss me as 'fuck this dirty karmawhore' and I get that a lot. It's just so dumb because like if you're gonna karmawhore anywhere on reddit, it's not /r/movies. It's easier on literally any other sub. You gotta actually care a bit here.</TEXT>

I didn't come out of nowhere and question your participation, commitment, general interest.  gt; nice job missing the point. What point was that? I assumed it was that my posts added nothing to this sub, but they obviously do. Sorry if I misread your original comment.  gt; something tells me you've rarely participated in any threads about any of the criterions you own. I could be wrong but you really give the illusion of that. You'd be wrong. Just ctrl-f'd my comment history real quick and it's 9 threads in the past 3 weeks that I've commented on, plus in the ones I posted. It's not 5-page reviews and in-depth film school-type analysis but like why are you so worried about it? I post/comment what I enjoy to post/comment.  gt; maybe posting more than the bare minimum? More comment karma than anyone else ever on /r/movies = bare minumum. Got it.  gt; lol this massive post is probably the most you've ever posted to anyone here. Maybe. Maybe not.

    <TEXT>Damsel was the biggest surprise of the year so far for me. I don't want to spoil it for you but it's the perfect anti-Western. Laughed every minute. I'm a huge Robert Pattinson stan though. Legitimately the funniest movie I've seen in a while. Hostiles was so brutal. It's like a 2-hour existential crisis, in a good way lol. The marketing/release for it was a complete disaster so it kind of fell off and never went anywhere. From your list, Don't Worry, He Won't Get Far On Foot was worth the price of a ticket just for that Jonah Hill monologue at the end. I feel like that performance was worthy of an Oscar nom but there's 0% chance it happens. In the end though it was just a bit too all over the place for me. The editing/pacing felt off. Also Rooney Mara was wayyyy underused IMO.</TEXT>

The footage, cut from the film by Huston, was previously believed to have been destroyed. The Producer of the film, Frank Taylor, had kept in hidden in a cabinet inside his house for over 50 years.

    <TEXT>As OP of a lot (most?) of those posts, here's my take on it: Posters  amp; stills have always done better than other types of posts (trailers, casting news, etc). They get a lot more momentum in /r/new compared to most other types of posts. Trailers don't do that well (except like Star Wars, Marvel, DC, etc) because a lot of users are at work and can't watch them (I guess?) and a 1-second still/poster is just more digestible than a 2.5 minute trailer. You can still give out the same information in a title/thumbnail that'd you get in a trailer. As far as the recent uptick in them, on Friday morning EW [posted their Fall Movie Preview](https://ew.com/movies/fall-movie-preview-2018-photos/) and it had *a lot* (read: a shit ton) of exclusive stills. This was probably the biggest/best exclusive-stills dump I've ever seen: * Green Book (First Image/Still) * Beautiful Boy * A Private War (First Image/Still) * Front Runner * Holmes  amp; Watson (First Image/Still) * First Man * Sisters Brothers * Ben Is Back (First Image/Still) * Mandy * Hold the Dark (First Image/Still) * Apostle * Outlaw King (First Image/Still) * Etc, etc, etc. There were a bunch more. All high quality, lots of awards contenders, reddit-favorite actors/directors, etc. Most of the movie-news websites only picked up  amp; released articles on the Aquaman, Suspira, and Creed II stills and the rest went under-the-radar. So obviously, those 3 got posted  amp; removed a bunch of times here because it really wasn't anything new. The rest, almost none got picked up except like Hold The Dark I saw a few times and maybe First Man. EW has a really shitty twitter and their website actually hides a lot of their stories/post so it's not surprising the stills went nowhere. I found the stills and decided to spread them out over the weekend  amp; Monday/Tuesday (5 of them got to #1 on this sub and hit /r/all). The sub is a lot more dead on the weekend so it's a better time to post something like stills. They do a lot better on weekends. It's timing, luck, title, and competing posts in /r/new - in that order. If I post something, I want it do well. Who submits something anywhere on reddit and goes, "i hope no one sees this and nobody cares"? I get shit on a lot for it because someone posting this much has to mean there's a conspiracy somewhere, but there just isn't (I'm sure there's people out there that I could never convince otherwise but I don't care I guess, shoutout to /u/aYearOfPrompts). Some posts obviously get upvoted because if you knew anything about /r/movies/new (or most /r/new queues I guess), it's easy to tell when something will rise. I'm a dude that spends way too much time and energy on reddit. It's bordering (past) addiction at this point but reddit  amp; movies is combining my 2 currently favorite things so oh well. I regularly check 30+ different websites for shit to post and 95% of my posts go absolutely nowhere. That's how it works: studios release stills, movie-news-aggregate websites pick up on them/write articles  amp; fluff, then those get to facebook/reddit/twitter/etc by individual posting them. Same with trailers, posters, etc. Dirty karmawhores like me just do it a lot more cuz why not. It's the same rotation everytime. It's easy to be super-cynical and /r/hailcorporate-y but this is an 18-million person subreddit dedicated to movies. Obviously the popular, easy stuff will rise to the top. You can't post a Citizen Kane discussion and except it get 28k upvotes. It's the same thing with like late-night shows. An actor will be doing promotion for a movie, they'll tell a story on a late-night show about some past movie, then movie-news-websites will pick up on it and write an article with a nice little thumbail, then that article will blow up on social media. It's a never-ending circle of that, but with movie-related stuff. I don't really get the criticism though. Thousands of people obviously care about these posts. People that go after me personally I honestly don't understand. I use 32 different source websites, I post about dozens of studios, hundreds/thousands of actors, hundreds/thousands of movies, every streaming service, every distributor, etc etc. Most of my titles are custom so I'm not a bot obviously. A lot of my posts are direct-image links so they don't generate clicks or anything. Like, who am I shilling for? The movie industry in general? I would understand getting shit for posting clickbait or general karmawhoring but this is not that. Karmawhoring isn't really possible on /r/movies anymore since the "recommendation must be in self post" rule and since mods have been cutting down on a lot of the circlejerky Man of Uncle/Ratatouille-type posts. You have to actually post stuff that follows strict rules. Clickbait is still a problem but the mods definitely get to removing those eventually. Websites like to report casting news as a done deal but then put 'in talks' in the actual article. That's clickbait. So that's that, AMA.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; I just think your posting habits make you a gullible patsy to the marketing team. You're doing their work for them for free, all day long, in a chase for karma versus having genuine interest in the films yourself. It's both. On one hand, I enjoy going for karma obviously. If someone at ~10M karma tells you they don't enjoy/care about it, they're fucking lying. Sure I'll burn out eventually I guess but I like it for now. Yes it's lame and useless but so what? So are most hobbies. On the other hand, movies are basically my life right now. I've seen about ~170 per year in theaters over the past 3 years. I see/have seen most movies I post about. I have a pretty big bluray/Criterion collection. I probably spend 5+ hours per day in /r/movies and other movie-related subs. I genuinely enjoy what I post about, believe it or not. So *why not* combine both hobbies? Like, I find a nice still about a movie that 99.9% of people have no idea is happening, give it a nice title, put information in the comments, etc. I know it'll do well most of the time because /r/new will be dead or quiet, stills/posters do well generally, and the actors/directors are reddit-popular. So then it blows up and hundreds of thousands of people see it and discuss it and get hyped about it. That's literally my favorite part about posting here, those kinds of posts. In my mind, those posts should be encouraged, not shit on as 'obvious fucking shill OP, reddit is an ad swamp'. I mean, I get it, but it's just backwards to me. It's not any better or worse than most discussions that go on here. Okay yeah I probably went overboard this week with the stills lol but I don't see what's wrong with them. Stills/posters are not the majority of my posts at all either. I post regular news/casting/etc just as much if not more (probably a lot more). Those don't get called out as much because...they just don't do as well lol. (and I deleted failed posts cuz dirty karmawhore) I've seen you always call me out (probably for over a year now), but it's just so irritating. In my mind, it's super obvious/clear why most posts do better than others.  gt; Don't you feel used? People get paid to do what you are doing, and you do it a lot. You ost so much, so often, that you fill up 2/3rds of the page on a regular basis. There is no space for the commuity to grow interests genuinely itself because you choke the page up with your karma chase. Nah I don't feel used. I enjoy posting and that's about it. I think I bring (alot) more good than bad to the sub. It's stuff that belongs here, people like, and fits within the rules. There's a bunch of other regular posters here but I just happen to be the one that posts a shit ton more. I don't understand why I'd be 'clogging' up the front page either. What exactly is wrong with my content? I get that in your mind it's a shady-conspiracy/unorganic when some posts get upvoted, but from the other side as some regular ass dude writing this, it's obviously just upvoted because it's popular and the community cares about it. See where we'd be stuck in our argument? Most of the things I post are things that would be posted anyways, like breaking news and such (except for small edits in the title or something). You're giving me too much credit in this regard.</TEXT>
