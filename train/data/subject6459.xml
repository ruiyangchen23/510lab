    <TITLE>Craft-sellers of reddit, what's your secret?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2013-03-02 13:20:39</DATE>
    <TEXT>I have been crafting practically all of my life, but only sold my wares to friends or family. I am now attempting (and failing horribly) at selling the things I make online on places like Etsy. I see pieces of comparable or even lesser quality with thousands of fans/followers or selling successfully while I have no idea where to even start getting any attention. I know a lot of sellers blog and find fans/followers that way, but that still presents the problem of how one starts to gain any fan-base. I am not a huge sharer of personal things or spreading my story or any of that in any way that's not anonymous, not that I'm unwilling, it's just anything other than Facebook is still pretty new/foreign to me (even though I'm 25). To those of you who've had success, do you have any suggestions on where to start or a good way to get attention? My Etsy store is very new with only one posting right now so it's had few views and only one "admirer," and I have to admit, it's pretty heartbreaking to work so hard, spending my nights up to the wee hours trying to be creative, just to feel kind of worthless, so any keys to success or warnings for failure are much needed! Thanks, from a fellow craft lover. Little update: I don' know if anyone will see this, but I'll ask anyway. I made these cards for friends and someone said I should sell them. I didn't really think many others would pay for them, but I thought I'd ask you guys if you think it's something I should invest any time/money into as another addition to my etsy store. http://imgur.com/a/PgTDN What do you guys think?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Attempting to start a craft blog, can anyone help?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2013-03-16 06:30:50</DATE>
    <TEXT>I would like to start a crafting blog, for a myriad of reasons, most importantly: * I have wanted to for a while, just to share all the things crafty in my world and be involved in other people's craft lives * I am attempting to start selling my wares, starting with Etsy, and apparently blogging in one of the lynchpins to selling/being seen * It's kind of a craft in and of itself, right? Problem is, I don't know where to start. I am far from computer illiterate and took a computer science class in college, but I want to start off on the right foot. I also a not so much into how computer dependent the world is these days, what with people updating people on twitter ever 2 seconds and not living in the real world (I know that last bit makes me sound like a 90-year-old complaining about them young whipper snappers, but I assure you I am only 25), but I realize that if you want to share/be seen/sell/etc. in the world of crafts, a blog is a must. I always felt blogs were kind of self-involved and narcissistic, but I have realized how wrong that is #8230; er, sort of. I enjoy reading other people's blogs and getting advice on every aspect of crafting, so why not do it myself? I'm getting kind of tired of only having my mom to show my projects to and want *other* people to praise me and make me feel good about myself. So, here are my starting-point questions: * What is the best free web-posting platform? I mean, totally free. I heard wordpress is good, but I need a host apparently, kind of don't know what it means, but it seems to need moneys. As of now, I have sunk a lot go money into crafting with no return (i.e. no sales on Etsy) and would like to avoid an actual subscription I have to pay monthly. * What draws you to a particular blog or what kind of features do your fave blogs have? * How do you get yourself out there? I post another question here on how to succeed on Etsy and was given advice that you have to: blog twitter, have a public Facebook. Kind of overwhelming so I'm trying to just get some momentum and start finally. I have been spending a lot of time just trying to have more than 3 items in my Etsy store with no success, but also noticing items on Etsy I could have made with $.25 beads and some wire in 7th grade getting like, 700 admirers (no offense to the successful people), but put my heart and soul into the items I make with little attention or even negative comments. I will admit, I am very discouraged. I am not only monetarily invested (way too invested), but emotionally invested in a way no dollar amount can quantify. Sorry for the huge post, I am just not familiar with putting my life on the net so getting started is very overwhelming and foreign to me.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>What's with the down-votes? Please read if you've been down-voting without comments. Can anyone who down-votes (esp. without feedback) help bring some light to this?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2013-04-03 08:42:18</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm more than a tad confused. Personally and on other people's posts I've noticed down-votes with zero feedback. To say this hurts and feels like outright rejection down't begin to express the hurt. EVen if there is something about a listing you didn't personally like, I feel like down-voting is in poor taste, especially since so many people who post here are struggling. To say that *I* am struggling on Etsy is the understatement of the year, so to see my posts here down-voted with no feedback as to why is salt in the wound. Can we all try to remember the point of this sub, which is to offer another arena for people on Etsy to get a little exposure since it's so difficult to do so solely on Etsy since there are like, millions of listings these days. Some shops who post here have thousands of views on hundreds of their own listings with hundreds to thousands of followers, favorites, treasures, etc. and down-votes may mean little to nothing to them, but before you hit that blue down arrow, remember that some of us don't have that kind of positive feedback to make us feel a little better and try to think, "why am I down-voting this?" If it's simply because it doesn't suit your taste, think again and don't throw out that vague negativity towards the shop owner. If there's something truly wrong with the posting or think it needs significant improvements that warrant a down-vote, then *at least* offer the feedback along with the down-vote. Let's all of us try to remember why we're in this sub and respect our fellow Etsy-ers. Edit: Aaaand 3 of my posts now have an additional down-vote #8230; is it because of this post? I'm losing my resolve here #8230;</TEXT>

    <TITLE>My spoon is too big! Well, no, actually I'm just trying to bend some silver-plated antique spoons and forks #8230; any pro tips out there?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2013-04-04 08:35:47</DATE>
    <TEXT>I got some silver-plated antique spoons and forks at an antique shop hoping that I could bend them (some at a pretty sever angle, like, in half #8230;) and kind of at a loss on where to start. * First, I thought I'd heat it up and bend it while hot with my butane torch, thinking I was annealing it. I actually did some research and found that annealing is heating it up, then quenching it and also that you shouldn't even anneal silver-plate, so that genius idea is out (on a related note, I snapped my poor fork in half, shouldn't have started with my favorite one not knowing what I was doing). * Using just my pliers works on the tines, but definitely not on the thicker parts of the handle. I no longer have access to a vice (my dad put it in the garage because our work bench was ruined so even if I found it I might not have a place to clamp it) but I do have a C-clamp. I also have gathered that I'll need a rubber mallet, which I will attempt to find or buy since it seems to be necessary. * Any tips for a total noobie? All of the instructions I find online make it seem simple and do-able will few professional tools but I can even figure out a way to hammer the handle around a shape (such as a mandrel or even a wooden dowel) to make small loops like a ring. I'm not attempting a ring for my finger, but say, I were attempting a heart-shape #8230; because well, I'm attempting a heart-shape. * I'm talking like, explain this to me like a physically (and socially, I might add) awkward 7-year-old with a possible mental handicap. Here are my tools: rubber mallet (once I find it), C-clamp (or vice if you don't think that will work), table of some sort, many pliers, wooden dowel or other rod in the size and shape of my desired final shape. * I've actually done quite a bit of metal work, but never with such thick and hardened metals and I am trying to make do with a very makeshift jewelry lab and equipment. Sorry for such a long post, but thanks if you can help! http://imgur.com/a/0sbO6  lt;-- that's a link to an album with pictures of the forks and spoons I got and sketches of what I intend to do with them. There is also a picture of the fork casualty before I did my due diligence and tried to anneal silver-plate, which is a big no no #8230; There is also a picture of the heart-spoon pendant that has been successful so far.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Any team advice or general advice for a new shop?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2013-04-04 13:32:13</DATE>
    <TEXT>I opened my shop about 1.5 months ago and only recently found this sub. I'd been posting stuff here thinking that /r/etsy was pretty much solely for etsy shop owners to post stuff and get some exposure and only recently realized that's not really the point (honestly, it really went over my head). So since this sub is to connect with other etsy-ers and help each other out, is there any advice for shops just starting out? I have been told to join teams, like the D-listers, but even that one requires a 10 item minimum, which I only recently met myself. Are there any other good teams out there for shops with little to no sales or few items? Also, as someone who doesn't even make enough from their shop to pay for their monthly McDonald's budget and thus relies on only their own labor and supplies bought at retail, it's not easy to increase the number of listings. How do you guys that have many items, sometimes hundreds, keep such a high inventory? I realize there are many etsy shops that are legitimate small businesses, if not moderately sized business (which I kind of don't understand) obviously their high quantity of high quality items is understandable. But for those of us who make things that's aren't perfect, don't have professional equipment or formal training, how do you maintain a professional appearance. Also, what are some good networking tips? I am not the kind of person who knows how to work a room and get their name out their and maintain all these relationships that I can benefit from so all this is way over my head right now. I only just started a public Facebook page and a crafts blog and still don't know what to do with them to garner any attention. When I see something I like, I don't immediately hit the "follow" or "favorite" button because I still think the mechanisms of social networking are kind of silly (I am only 25, I swear I'm not a computer illiterate old woman). Sorry for the wall of text, I'm just trying to use this sub for what it's here for: helping each other instead of just another place to hawk my wares. If I can help I'd be happy to #8230; but I'm sure I can't help ;)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Desperate for advice on my dog who's started snapping and biting</TITLE>
    <DATE>2013-06-14 07:12:44</DATE>
    <TEXT>This is a bit long, but there's a TL;DR at the end if you have experience with aggressive dogs and might have advice. Last September my family and I adopted a rescue Yorkie, Sadie, who used to have a home before she was found as a stray. Apparently they found her last family, but for financial reasons they couldn't take her back (it is suspected that they lost their house to foreclosure). I have some pretty deep emotional problems, sever depression etc. etc. and Sadie was a solution my therapist and I decided on. I have wanted a dog for longer than I can remember, but my brother has allergies so we decided to experiment with a "hypoallergenic" dog and since my therapist is an admin in a Yorkshire rescue society she helped us get Sadie. She fit right into the family. She wants to be with someone at all times and I needed a dog who would be a companion and want to spend time with me. My parents and brother love her as much as I do and she's been a therapy dog for the whole family since everyone here has been through hell and back with health issues between my brother and I. She has been sweet and loving, only once growling at us when we gave her a special dinner on a holiday and someone tried to move it and she thought we were taking it away. We can take her dinner bowl with regular food any time and she just looks at you wondering when she'll get it back. Recently, when my brother would touch her paw she'd snap at him and try to bite him, but seriously. She would open her mouth and try to put her teeth on his hand, but never close her jaw and alway afterwards she would look ashamed, guilty, apologetic, and sorry. It was always only my brother until recently she'd do it to anyone once in a while. It wasn't all the time, but very sporadically when you'd touch her paw. My dad held her down while I looked t her paw and it looked like there was a hangnail so we planned on getting it trimmed except she stopped snapping when I grabbed her paw an we thought it had been resolved. Well, a couple days ago she started snapping again, but it happened when you touched her paw, under her chin, and near her eyes (I was trying to clean her eye boogers). Tonight I touched her head and she really went after me, not just a snap, but she got up and went after me for a while. We were so confused, my dad thought he'd "test" her and touched her head and she bit him seriously and drew blood. After that he said, "Well, you guys better get used to the idea that we'll have to get rid of her," which obviously broke my heart (my dad's a bit of an annihilationist and expects the absolute worst will happen and declares it every time). I agree that having a dog who's gonna bite randomly with no provocation and no reason nor rhyme is dangerous and definitely not therapeutic, but if we give her up, which is heartbreaking enough, I'm sure she'll be put down, which would *kill* me. TL;DR: Has anyone had experience with a dog who never bit or growled or been aggressive start to bite completely randomly with no provocation? We're willing to do whatever is necessary to fix this problem; I don't believe in just dropping her off at a pound and moving on.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>As an AVID Sherlock lover (more specifically, a Cumberbitch) from across the pond, please please please, remember your SPOILER WARNINGS!</TITLE>
    <DATE>2014-01-02 08:13:04</DATE>
    <TEXT>I do realize that there are ways to watch the episode online or whatever, but my favorite part of watching Sherlock is sitting down in front of a tv with my parents, not a computer, and just watch the episode beginning-end without worrying about buffering/internet speed, etc. etc. My computer screen is what, 13" large and does not connect with my lovely 30-something" tv, which is not even adequate to enjoy the splendor that is Sherlock or more specifically, the beautiful specimen that is Mr. Cumberbatch. As such, I am waiting until it's on PBS here in America. There's already been one picture that showed one aspect of how Sherlock faked his death with absolutely no warning and I'm sure you can all appreciate how disappointing that could be. Even little things you may think of as a joke can reveal quite a bit about the episode that I'm patiently waiting to see in its entirety. I beg of you, any picture or screen cap or reference or whatever, please warn an american sister!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I'm going back to school to pursue a degree in Graphic Design and have no idea where to begin. Advice is very much needed  amp; appreciated!</TITLE>
    <DATE>2014-01-29 10:55:49</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hello, as my title says, I am going back to school to get a degree in graphic design and I don't even know where to start. Some background info to begin: * I went to the Illinois Math and Science Academy for 1 year, but was miserable living away from home (it's a public boarding school), and came home, although I actually enjoyed the school part more than I realized until I went back to my old high school. I've always had a knack for math and science and because of this I figured I was slated to be an engineer. * I have an undergrad degree in sociocultural anthropology from University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign that I got in 2010. I started out in BioEngineering, which I realized I hated about 1 year into college and switched majors. Right before graduation, unfortunately, that this was an intellectual curiosity rather than something I wanted to pursue as a career. * I've floated from idea to idea on careers to pursue, from paralegal to writer and such, but have recently realized I should have stuck with my gut after many many years and gone for a career that's at least somewhat artistic. I've always been very creative and artistic, but figured a degree in art is just too impractical (because there are *sooo* many well-paying careers in anthro), but through much soul-searching and thought have realized that graphic design will be a wonderful combination of art and practicality in this ever increasingly technological world, but have no idea where to start. Questions: * Is an associate's degree a good place to start, or should I pursue another undergraduate degree in order to expect job prospects in the future? I would like to get this degree done as quickly as possible since unemployment is getting old and I'd like to start being an adult with a career ASAP (I'm already 26), but I don't want to just to something quick and dirty just to have it done with if it's not going to be a good start to a practical career. * I should mention, this *has* to be an online degree. I live in the Chicago suburbs, but I can't even commute into the city due to health issues. * Which schools would you suggest in terms of quality and tuition? I've looked at the highest-rated schools according to several articles, but tuition for many of those schools is just as expensive as a brick-and-mortar school. I've done a little research into: SCAD, The New School, Full-Sail University, and Academy of Art University. After spending quite a lot on a degree I'm not putting towards a career as it is, I'd like to keep expenses to as little as possible, but again, quality of degree is of utmost importance, as well. * I've already emailed/spoken to a couple representatives from a couple schools, but I figured people who *aren't* trying to get me to spend money on their schools might have more honest and helpful answers. I'm also incredibly phone-awkward and these recruiters seem to want to speak on the phone rather than email #8230; so I'll admit I'm being a bit of a child and attempting to speak to people online where we can just post/message at our own leisure. I'm also pretty much totally nocturnal, which makes speaking with real, live, diurnal humans difficult. * Any additional advice you might wish to share about getting a degree online, feel free to post as I have a million questions, many of which I can't even remember. TL;DR: I wish to get a degree in Graphic Design, entirely online, and have no idea where to begin and need advice!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Anyone know of scholarships for people with depression?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2014-02-11 12:24:17</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hello all. I am planning on going back to school for a second bachelor's degree in graphic design, but am in major need of financial help. I am trying to find scholarships and thought maybe there would be some available for depression students. It would make sense to me that there would be foundations and such for people with mental/emotional disorders to get back to school and earn degrees that would help them move on with their lives and re-enter the social arena that school may help with. As far as documentation, which I imagine a scholarship granter would require, I have been taking anti-depressants for many years, 5+ years now. I went into treatment for an eating disorder, which is deeply connected with my depression, about 5 years ago. I have been seeing my therapist for over a year now, but I originally started seeing her right after I finished treatment for the ED. I am sure she would provide a reference, as well as my physician who prescribes the antidepressant. If anyone knows of opportunities for people with depression to get scholarships or any sort of financial help with education I would appreciate it very much if you could point me that right direction. Thanks!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Scholarships for Graphic Design degree?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2014-02-11 12:36:37</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hello all! I am planning on pursuing a degree in graphic design online at Full Sail University (most likely, not set in stone) and am looking for opportunities for financial help. Here is a little background info about me: - I've never studied art in an academic setting, just my own personal projects, but I've made art is all sorts of media before like metals, jewelry, paper crafting, etc. So I don't really have a portfolio per se, especially nothing in GD. - I've never really done any GD, just the software for my Silhouette paper cutting machine, but it's something I'm very excited about studying and making a career out of. - I've already got a bachelor's in Liberal Art's and Science from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in anthropology and business, but have decided to go another route. I've tried google searches and scholarship search engines, but they never do a proper job. They keep showing me scholarships I do not qualify for (for college seniors or like, amputee golfers no joke) so I thought I would check here to see if anyone got scholarships themselves they'd suggest. Any help would be greatly appreciated, thanks!</TEXT>

    <DATE>2014-02-13 10:05:21</DATE>
    <TEXT>Sometimes I'll just be browsing reddit with RES and never-ending reddit and the sounds of a video will just start. I can't tell where it's coming from. I have no links opened and no videos playing or anything and they don't usually sound like advertisements or anything. I can all the pages I've got open and I can't find anything with a video or sound or any idea where the hell it's coming from. The only thing I can do is close the tab I have reddit open in and reopen it. But, then I lose my place and page I have open. Does anyone have any idea why this happens and how to stop it? I *hate* browsing without never-ending reddit and loading new pages every time I'm done with one and all that so I don't want to have to do that.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Corporate Shenanigans</TITLE>
    <DATE>2014-05-21 12:18:46</DATE>
    <TEXT>I swear corporate's motto was "If it's not broke, fix it until it is" Rude customers and lazy coworkers are one thing, but dealing with corporate constantly screwing things up is what really made me quit managing at this chain of cafes. We have these little paninis that we'd put in these pastry bags that we used for all the pastries we had, which ranged from cookies to big muffins to croissants and everything in between so using a big, one size basically fits all pastry bag made sense. These paninis were skinny and long, so we just rolled the bags around the sandwich, worked just fine. Of course since it worked, corporate had to find a way to make it not work. They decided to create new bags that would fit the paninis *just right* so that we had bags for the other 20 items we had and individual bags for this one thing. Of course, they didn't actually try putting the paninis into the bags before getting thousands of them manufactured and sending them out to the stores. Whoever thought of this genius idea apparently only tried to fit the bread of the sandwich into the bag and didn't consider that we actually put other foods *into* the bread in order to make it an actual sandwich. So, now we have boxes and boxes of these bags that literally nothing will fit into from the pastry case taking up valuable space in my back room. If only this was the only genius idea corporate came up with. This isn't even the worst of their mistakes.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ham we had "day dot" with slashes that told us what day and at what time to throw food out. It made sense, but then corporate came up with the great idea to make *everything* fresh that morning or day and then throw *everything* out that night, which made sense on paper right? Everything was guaranteed fresh that day, except for the fact that we were a *tea cafe,* not a restaurant, so we didn't have the time or manpower to make sandwiches, muffins, croissants, etc. that day. And it wasn't even frozen or just pop in the oven or thaw. We had to bake the bread fresh everyday for the sandwiches, actually mix the muffin *mix* every morning, even thaw cream cheese and mix with lemon juice and wasabi and matcha powder for one of our 5 sandwiches every freak day. And they couldn't even just send us lemon juice, they sent us lemons to squeeze fresh for the wasabi cream cheese. I swear to god corporate didn't consider for a second how much work they crated for us with every "idea" they came up with.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Corporate consisted of the two owners who created the entire company years back and basically the people you just described. They used buzzwords like "synergy" and being "proactive" without having a clue what they actually meant. And the problem with the owners running this huge chain is that they created this chain of tea cafes, basically the Starbucks for tea, with a stand of like, 3 different iced teas. Then they added a couple more teas, then 5 more, then 10 more after that, then hey! let's have food, too! Great idea, let's carry frozen quiches that you thaw in the morning and leave out for 2 days! And then eventually we have 10+ teas hot and cold available at all times plus 20+ "mixed" teas (tea + lemonade or chai tea + milk) available at all times, plus 20+ custom teas we have to be able to brew at all times hot and cold, plus 15+ food items we have to make fresh *every single morning* that aren't even frozen or thaw-able, rather, we have the bread fresh every morning for 5 sandwiches and even mix up the muffin mix every morning and then again throughout the day if we run out of muffins and even mix the wasabi cream cheese and teriyaki sauce for another sandwich. Corporate had no clue how much work they created and were delusional under the idea that "well, when it was just the 2 owners in the beginning, they could run the whole cafe on their own." Just writing about it now has my blood boiling remembering how angry they used to make me. They should have to pay for my therapy, I swear.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Us floor managers used to do literally all the same work as the GM for 1/4 the pay, except for making the schedules, of course. That way, the GM could schedule himself for 50 hours a week while the rest of us only had 40 to justify his salary, except his extra 10 hours would overlap with us floor managers at one end of our shift and he'd sit in the back on the computer doing extra "GM" work and all he'd do is look at inventory lists and bullshit like that. He'd also benefit from all the store bonuses, except we were the ones selling over the store targets. He even got bonuses when we stretched the inventory by under-ordering things we needed and then we'd run out and we'd go to the grocery store up the street and compensate for the ingredients we needed off of the books and just make the GM loo good, ugh.</TEXT>

The fact that he treats a person and an entire culture as an object to be studied, then goes on to exploit everything he can, like taking a child bride as a prize. A 36 year old man has no place deciding that a girl who is *at most* 13 years old is old enough to marry and bear his children, especially since she was a member of a "primitive" tribe. He didn't love her, she was just a curiosity to use to garner fame and then abandon once she was no longer fascinating. Then, the bastard makes his son think his mother abandoned him. Ugh.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, the moral relativism some anthropologists adopt once they have the opportunity to exploit a culture blows my mind sometimes. If you're going to go native, then go native all the way. Move into the damned jungle and eat bugs and adopt the actual culture. You can't just take your pick of the "primitive" people you're "studying" and pretend like it's a genuine marriage. He exploited them, he exploited her, he knew he was in a position of authority given where he came from and where his "wife" came from. If it's their cultural age, you don't get to decide that it suddenly applies to you, then abandon her to her culture where she gets gang-raped by 20-30 men and then pretend you had no responsibility in that.

    <TEXT>I never condemned anthro just because of him. I said that *anthropologists like him* were part of why I need pursued anthro past majoring it in college. I think spending 4 years studying allows me to make up my opinion on the subject. You and a coupe others think that you can judge how I came to how I feel based on one comment, which doesn't even criticize anthro based on him, it mostly just criticizes the fact that he's a shitty human being. If being *actually* cared why I never got a professional degree in anthro or decided to pursue it further, I'd be happy to discuss, but I know that's not why people are jumping down my throat. I know that those people just enjoy starting fights based on the two words in my comment they actually read.</TEXT>

And your "butthurt" insult is exactly why I don't comment as much anymore on anything I really care about because there's little hope for intelligent discourse. It doesn't matter if she actually got pregnant till he 20s, the fact that he had sex with her at 10-13 years old means he was perfectly fine with her having his children at that age, I'm sure she wasn't on birth control.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't really care if Good says he loved Yarima or the Yanomama in his book, the fact that he was willing to make a Hollywood movie out of their culture says enough. He'd most definitely intelligent and aware enough to know that a movie, not a documentary, wouldn't treat the Yanomama with the respect they deserve. They'd be an oddity and become an exotic object to be gazed upon by the "rest" of us (look up "the gaze" if you want to know what I'm talking about and the problem many more anthropologists have with anthropology, not just me). Also, look up the Hottentot Venus if you need an example of that kind of treatment people like the Yanomama and Yarima would probably face It doesn't matter if the rest of us are in the 21st century and slavery is over (which it's not, of course), Good knew that a big budget, Richard Gere, Hollywood movie wouldn't depict these people and his strange love-affair in a factual, respectful manner. When he "married" Yarima and makes it ok to consummate the marriage and impregnate her, according to you, then it's only ok if he actually adopts the culture and takes on the responsibility he would have according to the Yanomama. He had to know she wouldn't be able to adapt to the Western world and so his obligation is to either know that he cannot have his foot in both camps and just not accept the 12 year old as his bride, or actually stay with the Yanomama for good. He doesn't get to have it both ways, in my opinion.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The fact that he consummated, as in, had sex with a 13 year old native, means he was fine with her bearing his children since she *probably* wasn't on "stone age" birth control. Waited 8 years? Are you that naive or just that desperate to prove your point? Do you *really* think he abstained from sex with her for 8 years until he wanted to have a child? Because h didn't, it says right in the article that he claims that because it's "ok" in the Yanomami tribe for 13 year olds to be given away like an object that it's ok for him to have sex wit her. Oh, it's also ok with them that 20-30 men gang rape their women if their husbands aren't around. I didn't say she had his children at 13, just that he condoned it. And it doesn't matter if she had children or not, the problem is that he had sex with a 13, or maybe even 10, year old who, let's just admit it, wasn't nearly as advanced as he was. She's not a lesser human being, but he used a position as someone who they probably thought had magical powers and took a child as a bride-prize. People like you just *love* to whip out the social justice warrior label as if it's a get-out-of-an-argument free card. As if it immediately means that whatever I'm saying is just some hyped up "fox news" advocate, which doesn't even make sense by the way. Wouldn't a SJW be the opposite of Fox news? And I read the article from beginning to end and studied anthropology for 4 years, my opinion of anthro and my position on how some less than moral anthropologists behave is fully formed. Just because someone has a strong opinion on a subject doesn't suddenly make them some SJW who has no sense or right to have said opinion. I can't believe fighting for someone else's rights these days means they aren't allowed to have an opinion.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Oh, no, I get that. I'm just getting a little heated with all these people yelling at me claiming it's ok that he married a 13 year old girl and consummated it just because she didn't actually bear children until she was 20. As if the fact that makes him a moral person. And I get that he's no model anthropologist, he just embodies all the misgivings I had about actually getting a professional degree or trying to publish anything. The whole attitude that other cultures, especially if their primitive or less developed than the western world, are open for outside interpretation and that interpretation is more accurate than if the culture represented themselves, which in many cases, such as this one, isn't even an option for them. They can't even speak english and they'd probably end up being treated like if we discovered a new species of frog somewhere that had never been found before.</TEXT>

How does it matter if he was attracted either? So if he thinks a 13 year old is ugly, but still fucks her somehow he's not a pedophile? I hope you're just being sarcastic.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Full Sail online. I haven't even taken a photoshop class. This was for a Psychology of Play class where we had a couple days to invent a company and design a logo for it, mine was a craft store called Cr.A F.T. for "Create Art For Therapy." The project was to invent a company that would incorporate play and how we would use play in the company. It's not an actual corporate logo designing project.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm not sure, to be honest. This wasn't for a corporate logo project or like, photoshop class or anything. This is the second class for the entire degree called Psychology of Play and we had about 5 days to create a company, it's mission statement, and create a logo for it. So, I did this in a couple hours to go along with my company, Cr.A.F.T. for "Create Art For Therapy" It was just a quick project to show that we understand the benefits and definitions of play and to apply those concepts to a company we create. In my case I made a craft store and explained how arts and crafts can be play and benefit your mind and happiness and ability todo work. The logo was just a small creative aspect of the project. It's not supposed to be particularly unique and amazing since none of use have taken branding class or even a photo manipulating class.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks for the feedback and suggestions. I will definitely check out that article. I have no experience with photo manipulation so I used Gimp to make this to kind of get my feet wet and get started with some programs before I start taking the actual classes. Some people have told me doing an online degree program is waste of time and money, etc. but I don't thane the physical health to commit to a brick-and-mortar program and I need a a structured way to learn graphic design because I don't think I could do the teach-yourself method. Thanks for just giving me feedback and resources instead of unsolicited advice and calling me "pants on head retarded"</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No, this is just one of the intro classes. We had several creative options for the project and I wanted to get started on some photo manip before the actual class starts in a couple months. I'm sure most other people did some more simplistic and less involved options, I just happen to be the kind of person who gets really involved even when it's not required. I was having fun learning Gimp, but this is the first time I'd used it so I had to teach myself from Lynda.com and such to get started. This class doesn't have anything to do with logo design, corporate branding, or anything of the sort. It was just a small part of a psychology class project.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It wasn't for an actual company or logo design class or anything like that We just had to invent a company that incorporated "Play" for a psychology of play class and make a logo for it. It's only the 2nd class for the program I'm in and this was just a small part of it. It's not going anywhere further than a small part of the website I designed for my fake company. Most other people probably just put their company's initials in big letters or something. This is an introductory class for a larger design school with people in all kinds of majors like game design and music and everything so the logo wasn't supposed to be anything but a small part of a larger project.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't know why I even posted my first creative project for my 2nd class in my program that isn't even a graphic design class, but a psych class, to this forum because I knew it would get picked apart and no one would listen or care that this was a first attempt in a project that wasn't even aimed at logo design. I have 0 experience, have not studied logo design or corporate branding at all. This was just a fun, creative, very small part of a project for a psych class that everyone at my design school takes, whether they be music, game design, etc. etc. majors and I was kind of happy with how I was able to cut each element out for each part of the logo. It's not the next Google or Mac logo. Hell, it's for a made-up craft store akin to Michael's or JoAnn, which are hardly the sleekest or sophisticated companies.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I believe this up until the most recent batch of British television. Sure, the old stuff, like Inspector Morse or Midsomer Murders (I'm a big fan of British murder mysteries), have a couple lookers, but for the most part have actors who look legitimately average. However, the newer shows like Call the Midwife, Downton Abbey, Sherlock, Mr. Selfridge, Upstairs Downstairs, etc. have a cast increasing in attractiveness and number of both attractive regulars, as well as the one-off cast members.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Commission sales: the 10th circle of retail hell</TITLE>
    <DATE>2014-05-28 15:46:23</DATE>
    <TEXT>My first foray into *actual* retail (not just working in a grocery store, cafe, restaurant, etc like a lot of us talk about) was kind of a shock since I was expecting the nasty, rude customer to treat me like garbage, but when you throw the fact that you're ability to pay for food relies on *commission* all niceties and friendship with coworkers goes out the window. My 3rd day working commission in a women's clothing boutique in downtown Chicago was basically my test to see if they'd hire me on permanently and so the commission I made that day was make it or break it. My manager knew this and was acting all encouraging and like he was trying to get me the good customers so I would be employed. First, he sends me the high school girl shopping on her mother's dime, which *would* be good, except for the fact that she's a size 22 at the least and he knows we don't carry any sizes over an 18, thanks boss. Even though she doesn't fit a goddamn thing she still kept me at her beg and call to get her the next size since ours "were all vanity sized too small" for hours and so I missed out on any opportunities to help someone for decent commission. This continued throughout my day, my manager throwing me all the small fish and taking the big sales for himself when I finally met a woman who was looking to spend some good money. I set her up in a room with a bunch of maxi dresses, one in particular I loved myself, and then my manner butts in and suggests even more and throws his choices into her room, hoping to poach my sales. She came out of the room with one of the dresses *I picked* and he ran up to her to tie the bow before I could and she loved the dress and bought it along with 2 other dresses *I picked* that added up to a decent amount that would put me over the minimum required for a permanent position as a stylist. At the end of the day I asked for my total and it was half of what it should have been. What?!? I ask to look at the commissions report and I see half of the stuff i "sold" saying that my manager was the stylist and ask the cashier girls about it and they said that even after I walked my clients to the registers, he would tell them that some of the items were his commission since he directed the girls in my position or in the case of the maxi-dress customer, he'd "styled" the dress and I'd only picked it. I mean, I *expect* customer to shit all over me and make me feel like the help, but when your own boss knows that you need the sales to get the job that you also need and still he goes out of his way to screw you over, that just hurt. And that was my last day in commission retail, or as I would consider from my experience in all kinds of different flavors of retail, the 10 circle of retail hell.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well, if I want to go to design school and you're saying I should do what I want to do, telling me that it's "pants on head" retarded is a pretty awful way of sending that message. And btw, I'd love to go to a brick-and-mortar design school (and going to design school is the best option for me for reasons you couldn't possibly know of and don't have the right to question), but I'm disabled and cannot go to an actual design school at this point in my life. So, it's either accept defeat and spend the rest of my life restricted by the limitations of my health, or find an option that will let me grow and move forward and feel that I'm doing something with my life. So, unless you want to apologize for your first idiotic, rude, and completely unsolicited comment, I don't care to hear anything else you'd like to say because I can only take so much ignorance in one day and being a redditor that quota gets filled awfully fast.</TEXT>

All the stylists were like sharks, knowing which customers were the bigger spenders and making sure to "claim" them the second they walked into the store, it was kind of creepy actually. I wasn't ever hired on with a real job because of that day so I'd never have the chance to report him, but even if I had gotten the job I wouldn't have lasted very long. Commission sales at that store very much depended on lying to customers and shilling ugly, ill-fitting clothes.</TEXT>

I was awful at commission because so many girls would squeeze themselves into trampy, ill-fitting dresses and the good salespeople would lie and tell them how great they looked. The key to good sales at that store was being a good lier, which I am not. The best salesman at my store were these two reply flamboyant gay guys that would just be like, "Guuuuurl yu look HAWT!" and I just wasn't that big of a personality. These two guys really upped their flamboyance, too, because when they weren't selling they were much less... obnoxious.</TEXT>

And yes, I'm an amateur, I'm taking my second class in a graphic design program, that's basically the definition of amateur, no?

It had an very clever message and it wasn't matter if a series of elements doesn't make a chemical element, it was a play on words: Element, noun: a part or aspect of something abstract, esp. one that is essential or characteristic The fact that I used actual elements to spell a word was easy. Go ahead, try to make a retirement card message using only real elements. Not so easy, huh? Your "criticism" was just stupid and splitting hairs on a very clever card message custom made for the recipient. Just because you give criticism, doesn't mean I have to take it seriously.</TEXT>

I use a Silhouette cutting machine, though, and make all my own original designs. If you get more into card making and can invest in one, it's totally changed my card-making game. Even if you don't have a Silhouette, check out their website and the designs you can buy from them because they have great ideas.

    <TEXT>I use a Silhouette, which is the most amazing machine, in my opinion. I tried a cricket and was so disappointed that you couldn't make a single original design and returned it. The Silhouette is so amazing because I haven't had to buy a single font, cut design, anything because you can design all your own graphics and use free downloaded fonts. I use the sketch pens for the lettering on "the most noble element" which are so fun. Sometimes I want a really intricate design that won't cut correctly so I just sketch it on instead and offset it, like I did with the lettering.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Most of them I made templates from scratch and used my Silhouette Cameo to cut all the pieces out (it would have taken years to do by hand, especially the hydrangea), but I got a lot of the ideas from other projects since there's already so many tutorials already around.

    <TEXT>Thanks! I used to make paper flowers a while ago and I had a week off of class so I thought I'd do a summer break project. There are a lot of tutorials for wreaths with maybe one or two different flowers and you can buy them on Etsy, but I got the idea in my head on my own and didn't check out those tutorials ahead of time because I didn't want to just end up copying someone else's ideas for the combination and everything. I ended up going to Michael's when they had a really good sale on open stock scrapbook paper and just picked the ones I thought would look good together and then just made one flower, then another, and then decided what colors in what shapes would look good where. It wouldn't have been possible to really plan so I mostly just winged it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Near the end I had to fiddle with it a lot. I'd step back, see a whole here that could use an orange fringy flower, decide a blue mum would look good there, this purple magnolia should be about .75 inches smaller, etc. then cover all the rest of the foam form with green leaves. So once I decided I was done once and for all it was a relief. I had to just step away before I fiddled it to death and tore all the petals off trying to get them in the exact right spot. But definitely a great feeling once I was satisfied and thought it was ready to hang.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I bought some Aleene's spray acrylic in order to make the paper waterproof and protect it because I originally planned to make it for the front door, but upon realizing how much time and effort went into making it I didn't even want to risk the possibility of it getting destroyed in a storm so it's not an indoor wreath. I tried to test the spray on a reject flower and it made the paper look a little waxy or like it had been permeated with water and ruined the effect a little, like they looked like silk flowers and not paper ones. I might try to look for something else to help protect it, but unless I find something that will keep the paper effect I'll probably just leave it as is and hope for the best.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks! I originally tried to use spray acrylic to waterproof it so it would be hung outside, but I'm pretty sure it wouldn't make it actually waterproof and it's just made to protect paintings so I decided to make it an indoor wreath. When I tested it on a reject flower it also made the paper look wet or greasy and kind of ruined the whole effect of them being made with paper so I'm just going to leave it as is and hope for the best, unless I can find a product that doesn't change the appearance.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I originally started out with a Cricut mini, which sucked. Couldn't even cut a letter smaller than a half inch, so tried a full-size Cricut because I read they worked better than the minis. It *kind of* worked better, not by much, but then I had to update it and the software and found out you can't do that with a Mac, so essentially I couldn't even use it and returned that also. I finally went for broke and got a Silhouette and wow, it's so much better than the Cricut. I got a $35 credit for their store with templates and cut files and all that and never spent a cent because you can download all the fonts you want online for free and import then into the software, you can make everything fro scratch or just "trace" shapes from pdfs and any files you find online. You can make it as complex or simple as you want depending on how much time and energy you want to spend or not spend. I swear I don't work for Silhouette :) I just love the machine and it's brought so much more depth to all my paper projects.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The portrait will only cut paper that is "portrait" sized, so 8x12". It really depends on what you'll use it for and how much. The extra money to use the Cameo is worth it times a million for me because it's much more versatile. You can use a 12x12" mat which will accommodate your everyday scrapbook paper pack, but I often use a 12x24" mat so I can cut a whole bunch at once, which was a major advantage when I did this project, but also in general it makes it easier to map out a project when you can get every single element onto one page. You can also use mat-less materials like a long piece of vinyl that's 12' wide and like, 12 feet long or something crazy like that which people who make those wall decals use. I haven't tried that yet, but I like that I have that option. I wasn't *quite* sure how much I'd use the machine and I was a little apprehensive given that I found the Cricut wasn't nearly as versatile as I'd hoped, but once I started using this I was sold. Once this one wears out, which I don't imagine will be for a while but even when it does happen it'll be because I worked it to death and got every single pennies' worth out of it, I have no doubt I'll get another Silhouette. There's actually a new Cricut, Cricut Explore, which is *a lot* like the Silhouette is now, so maybe they've improved some stuff, but even if they made the software more versatile, the one's I tried still had some pathetic cutting skills whereas I can cut the tiniest script with the Silhouette. However, when I encountered the problem with updating the software/machine when I first got the Cricut and talked to customer service, they said their programs were incompatible with updating on a Mac and made no mention whatsoever that they're were working on it or trying to find a way to make it work with Macs, so who knows if it will ever be updatable on a Mac. Anyway, now that I've written an entire essay on why I love my Silhouette, good luck if you get a machine and good luck on any future projects!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thing is... you never know how much you *need* something until you get it. I thought this machine would be fun and I'd make some cool stuff, but I can't tell you how much it's expanded my paper-crafting repertoire and added so much depth to all the projects I make. I thought it'd save me time... but I have to be honest and say I spend even *more* time on individual projects, but that's just because I get so into the software and it allows you to make some truly exceptional things. Here's a card I made with the machine that this subreddit seemed to like: [Retirement card](http://i.imgur.com/mxRl05M.jpg) And none of it was a pre-made design, the Silhouette software allows for so much creative freedom, but if you're not into all the graphics and making it yourself, it's also super easy to buy or even get free projects and cut files. It's as simple or complex as you want to make it. I swear I should sell the machines I love them so much.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Oftentimes I get clip art online or just find graphics I like and either make my own version using regular shapes or the silhouette software has a "trace" tool that can kind of render simple graphics into cut shapes, it's amazing. The periodic table elements I just made with rectangles and picked a font I like, but it also has a sketch feature where you can put a little pen where the blade usually goes and it'll write or sketch a shape or word instead of cutting it, which I use when I need really small words that would just end up jumbled if I tried to cut them out, like the teeny tiny atomic weights. Other than the sketched atomic numbers and weights and the "most noble element part" that's also sketched onto paper, it's pretty much all paper that was cut out with the machine and then the stripes are ribbons and wash tape. Even the tiny outlines on the microscope and flask are cut from black paper. If you're considering a machine, you can download their software before you even buy anything and just try out projects you might try and see if you like their program. I did that I was blown away how easy to use it was, but also how sophisticated. I use the Adobe suite like photoshop and illustrator and you can do some pretty neat stuff with the silhouette software compared to the professional stuff.</TEXT>

The only problems arise when you work really hard on something and no one care or likes it, like when I tried to branch out onto Etsy, but just making stuff for fun and sharing it here makes it all worth it when it makes others want to make creative stuff and expand their own craft repertoire.</TEXT>

Once I went back to school to study graphic design I definitely didn't have the time to make things that weren't selling.

    <TEXT>3000 or 300 Euro? If it's 3000 then holy macaroni, but even 300 is a lot. I paid about $260 USD, which is about 190 euro. I don't know what kind of online ordering companies you have where you live, but I got mine through the website of Home Shopping Network and got a great deal. It came with all 4 of their tools, which are very helpful, but not necessary, and $35 credit for their store for templates and projects and such. Amazon also has some pretty good packages with good prices, but again, I have no idea what you have access to. It's definitely a lot of money and I'd understand the temptation to get the portrait to save some money. I hardly ever make anything that has dimensions over 8x12". Really, I'd just like the larger mats so that I can get more pieces into one pieces of paper and waste a little less paper, so I doubt the size of the portrait mats would actually hold any project back. The biggest advantage of the Silhouette is the software and ability to manipulate shapes and such, so if the cameo is really that much more expensive I'd bet the portrait would be a good option.</TEXT>

The managers might be hired and never show up, one was awesome for a week then juts quit right in the middle of a day and after that a manager wasn't even hired for almost 4 months. The floor managers had to do everything, literally everything, including hiring. Everyone in the car basically did the work of a position higher than them, plus the work of their actual position, all for the same wages. The floor managers did every single bit of work a GM would be paid $40+ k for, except they were doing it for minimum wage + tips. They finally got us a manager when one of the floor managers said they'd have to start paying her for the GM work she was doing if they wanted her to keep doing it. Apparently the idea of promoting from within and just making one of the floor managers an actual GM was so offensive that they finally just hired a real gm.</TEXT>

Most of them I got from one paper artist. Here are the links for what I used or based my own templates on: Easter lily Rose Dahlia Peony Poppy/Anemone Ranunculus Mum Hydrangea Calla Lily Tulip Some of these were "print and cut" kinds of projects, which required you to prints basically 4 pages or more of full ink and then cut out the bits for like, 1 flower, which is ridiculous, so I adapted a lot of those into cut files for I could just use pretty scrapbook paper instead. Putting the flowers on was kind of haphazard. I made some flowers I meant to use as focal points, like the hydrangea, the purple peony (I'm not sure you can even recognize which I'm talking about), the orange one in the bottom right side, etc. and I'd place those around the wreath frame (18" extruded foam circle wreath form from Michael's for like, $8). Then I'd make batches, like, 2 yellow lilies with 2 pink lilies, 4 calla lilies, then place those around to balance size and color. Make another batch of blues then do the same thing I'd do this over and over again until there was an adequate balance of flower size and colors, then make a bunch of "neutral" flowers like the roses, the small rolled up flowers, the mums, etc. and kind of fill in the rest until it looked full. Then came making a whole lotta leaves to fill in gaps and cover the rest of the foam frame once I was done with flowers. I'm sorry it's not a good tutorial. Unfortunately I didn't take any in-progress pics because it was just so much work and stressing me out so much already I was just lucky I got it done before my summer semester of classes started and I wouldn't have the time or mental fortitude to finish it. I'd make a proper tutorial if I make another one, but my mom doesn't need one so the only other reason is if someone wanted me to make one for them to buy, but I don't see that happening either. I don't have the time to make them and put them on Etsy just in case someone *might* buy it and then be crushed if they don't so.. sorry, I totally rambled.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I haven't *quite* found a solution, yet. We have those dust-blowy-thingies for keyboards and computers that work so far. I also tried to find treatments for the paper to water-proof them or just protect the paper better, but I can't found anything that doesn't make the paper look a lot different. Like, the acrylic makes the paper look wet, or waxy and not look as much like paper and sort of ruins the effect I was going for, which is to look like handmade paper flowers. The treatments make them look like manufactured silk flowers so I've just decided leave them as they are. I think the dust spray thingies should suffice to clean them, though.</TEXT>

Here are the links for what I used or based my own templates on: [Easter lily](http://liagriffith.com/make-a-paper-easter-lily/) [Rose](http://liagriffith.com/make-a-long-stemmed-red-rose-for-your-valentine/) [Dahlia](http://liagriffith.com/make-a-paper-dahlia-for-fall/) [Peony](http://liagriffith.com/paper-peonies-to-remember-summer/) [Poppy/Anemone](http://liagriffith.com/make-some-paper-poppies/) [Ranunculus](http://liagriffith.com/sunny-yellow-paper-ranunculus-to-welcome-in-spring/) [Mum](http://liagriffith.com/making-paper-mums-with-plum-purple-and-orange-metallic-papers/) [Hydrangea](http://liagriffith.com/make-these-gorgeous-paper-hydrangeas/) [Calla Lily](http://cp.c-ij.com/en/contents/3202/arrangement09/downloads/arrangement09_i_e_a4.pdf) [Tulip](http://cp.c-ij.com/en/contents/3202/arrangement11/downloads/arrangement11_i_e_a4.pdf) Some of these were "print and cut" kinds of projects, which required you to prints basically 4 pages or more of full ink and then cut out the bits for like, 1 flower, which is ridiculous, so I adapted a lot of those into cut files for I could just use pretty scrapbook paper instead.</TEXT>

I'm dealing with a lot of health problems, both emotional and physical, myself and the worst part is feeling like you're totally alone in your struggle and that no one cares. When anyone reaches out, even people I haven't spoken to since elementary school, it makes me feel a lot better.

    <TEXT>Just a little personal experience with /r/depression... it made me more depressed. It's, not surprisingly, comprising depressed people who are really depressed and constantly making posts about how depressed they are and that they're hopeless and lonely. Finding a community of people who understand your situation is a huge part of getting better, but being in a huge community of strangers who are all throwing in their own despair can add to your depression, not that you're depressed, I don't know your situation I'm just speculating. If you find a person or two who you can connect with and talk to, that's great, but just as a warning about 2 months after subbing that sub, I had enough and couldn't take the barrage of negativity and sadness.</TEXT>

It's great to find people who are experiencing the same issues as you because we all know how awful the loneliness of depression is and getting advice from people who've never experienced it is worthless sometimes, but a place like /r/depression did not work for me, that's for sure. And like you, adding you're own sad story to the rest of the sea of misery feels like you're just adding to a big problem. It also seems like most people there are too absorbed in their own depression to add anything constructive and I don't mean that in a critical way, it's just a fact that when you're inundated with your own depression there's not a whole lot you can do to help others before you address your own problems.</TEXT>

Which is great, I'd rather be one of a million participating in this than to be special because no one else wanted to help. I told my mom and she said there should be a network for other people experiencing issues like his where you can request a card from someone else who has the time or means, but can't get quite the same attention as Danny. She said it would have to be anonymous, but I'd much rather know the kind of person I'm making it for because it's a genuine connection that's going to help people in unfortunate situations.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The dark, practically black of his shoes is drawing my eye in that direction, which I don't think is a good thing. It also makes them look like little black blobs instead of a defined foot. I agree with another commenter that a brighter, less muddy yellow would look good on his sweater. Also, a darker brown for the majority of his legs would look better, like the brown in the cuff, which looks slightly darker. The straight and undefined nature of his legs is kind of throwing me, as well, and the proportions looks a little off, but since it will be animated that might not matter. All in all, I like it, I'm just nitpicking since you asked for suggestions, otherwise I wouldn't have considered it flawed it any way.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't think his argument is that people in the funeral business don't deserve the money they are paid, but rather that we spend exorbitant amounts of money to put a dead person in the ground. They deserve the money they're paid for the work they do, but the work they do is unnecessary. We spend thousands to make a dead body look alive so that we can bury it in the ground. We spend thousands to make a really nice box to put that dead body in so that we can bury it into the ground. We spend thousands of dollars to make the ground around these nice boxes holding dead bodies. We spend thousands of dollars to "honor" a dead person, but in reality we're just denying death itself. The circle of life would have our bodies turn back into the earth and nurture new life. Now, because of the way we all live these days there are health concerns that make it dangerous to just leave a dead body to decay in the ground, but that's what cremation should be for. Regardless of your philosophy on the afterlife and honoring and remembering our dead, I agree that it's ridiculous that we spend thousands upon thousands to take up as much space in death as we did in life. We're literally burying thousands of dollars in the ground. *Also, funeral homes generally markup those coffins by an incredibly high margin, which I don't believe is "earned"</TEXT>

I just don't agree with spending all that thousands of dollars on something you put in the ground. A funeral service is not what I'm talking about either. I'm specifically talking about embalming bodies, making caskets, and maintaing the grounds where this money has been buried.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is a guy who can't "land" a woman because his understanding of all women and marriage has been learned from reddit: So, no matter how unattractive, awkward, socially off-putting he *may* be, he deserves a 10 on the scale even if he would be a 4. Once married, if she wants to stop working to take care of house and family, she's *leeching* off his hard-earned money and living the easy life but if she keeps working and even *thinks* about quitting, even as a "joke" (you know all about jokes, software_engineer, right?), it *must* means she deeply resents this guy and fantasizes about some rich guy she wishes she married. Oh, but remember, this wife's fantasy man doesn't even want her. He doesn't need to marry, but he can bang any "moderately" attractive woman he wants, except this guy's stupid wife *must* think that if she's good enough to bang mr. macho-rich-guy, she's good enough to get any mr. hottie out there and adds to the regret for marrying you every day. Oh, and can't forget. If the *wife* decides to work and the kids spend more time in daycare or with a nanny, then she's an awful other who neglects their kids. Neglecting kids is the main role of the father according to reddit. I'm pretty sure the guys over at the red pill recruit boys out of elementary school just by sitting them in front of advice animals threads</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I couldn't find scrapbook paper that was 2-sided and in a book either. Even the by-the-sheet paper that was double sided was too expensive or boring so I just used one sided paper. Michael's had a sale for their cheap-ish individual, bulk paper that was normally 60 cent/page on sale for 6 for a dollar so I stocked up. It's slightly thinner so it's easier to shape and worked well with the Silhouette. I don't know if you shop at Michaels, but it's actually on sale now, but it's 4/$1. I just tried to have the patterned side face out depending on the flower design so that the least about of white showed, like for the roses the innermost petals have the pattern facing outward and the rest are facing inward.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Very nice! I wish /r/jewelry and /r/jewelrymaking had bigger community that wasn't spammed by commercial jewelry makers sometimes so we could get more feedback and such, but it feels like there are about 5 of us somedays. Did you make the silver dangly charms? I like them a lot and love the idea of using the balled end through a chain to hold them in place. Also, what kind of chain is that? I like it a lot, I like the matt look since the shiny stuff sometimes cheapens a handmade metal piece. I don't know how much experience you have with soldering, but I'm looking for chain I can solder directly to sheet metal, if you happen to know if it exists or is possible.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I feel like a total noob when I say this, but I rarely work in silver. Making jewelry is entirely a hobby, I sometimes sell jewelry, but I found trying to be "commercial" with it just kind of broke my heart when I never got attention or just got lost in the sea of artists/crafters on etsy. I decided to save my own withering self esteem that I'd do it just for fun and sell to friends and family, so even silver is out of my price range. I work with base metals rights now, which I actually like aside from price because of the different finishes and color combinations, for example this is one of my favorite pieces: http://i.imgur.com/4j7EhCm.jpg I just got a huge load of metals and tools recently and blew the bank on just base metals, but I'm certainly an amateur and as I built my skills I'll be able to start justifying the purchase of silver. Kudos on the felting the ends of those wires through the chain, though, that must've taken serious skill. I thought you'd maybe melted the head on its own and then open the chain to put it through, but then you'd have to resolder it so either way, that would take lots of practice. The reason I asked about soldering chain to sheet is that I've had all these ideas for weaving chain through sheet and different forms, but balance can't be achieved without connecting the chain to the sheet at some point and I'd rather not glue it. Thanks for the tips! The internet is awesome because of all the resources, but at the same time, there are too many sometimes. I don't know where to start and get overwhelmed and then I'm afraid to screw up, but really I need to just jump in more often even when I think I'll mess up. I have recently gotten a subscription for lynda.com so I'll have to take advantage of that for sure.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Oh man I am all over the board when it comes to art and crafts. Recently I'd been on a huge paper crafting kick making tons of cards and bought a Silhouette digital cutting machine and everything. I also love painting and sewing and everything, which is fun, but when you have limited space it creates absolute chaos. Combing the two isn't particularly crazy, like I made little metal charms to accent cards, but since most people throw the cards away it kind of broke my heart to see them go to waste. I suppose you might be able to combine small accents of metalwork into a watercolor? Like, off the top of my head if you had a scene with an old house or something and a cut metalwork window frame, maybe even with enameled windowpanes. Or a scene with an old bike and cut metal wheel spokes? Of course, with enameling that's another obsession to get caught up with and spend more money getting all into it, story of my life!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'd love to see the file on rivets! I actually just bought some stuff to make my own since I've never done that, only bought ready made ones. You know, at first I didn't like the idea of jumping on the bandwagon and making "trendy" jewelry, but that lasted about a minute because it if paid my craft/art supple bill I'd do that in a heartbeat. I actually have a problem catching onto the trends before everyone and their aunt is making an octopus pendant or longitude and latitude bangle bracelets. I also suck so much at marketing myself because I'm very introverted, some may even say antisocial, but it's not really anti socialism as much as not-good-at-being-social, such as still not "getting" twitter and I hate posting everything on social media. I tried doing the social media stuff to get my name out there and I just fizzled. For the time being, I'm ok making stuff that I'm half sad that I can't sell it and half happy that not being able to sell it means I can keep it for myself. Although, once I'm truly broke that probably won't work as well. I also wish I could get into every method there is, like I'm just now trying to learn chasing, but it always requires money and time, which I'm short of on both. I recently went back to school for another bachelor's, this time in graphic design, which is super fun, but takes up tons of time. I wish I had enough time to do everything but I kind of have to make sure my assignments are done, but I'm also obsessive and a bit perfectionist about my art so I spend about 10x more time than I really need to. Are you a jewelry maker as your profession and support yourself with it?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As I was ordering my metals and supplies and saw that you order from Rio Grande, I thought I'd let you know about this site I ordered from: MonsterSlayer.com (I know, weird name, right?). Their prices are pretty great, especially compared to Rio. They don't have *quite* the selection, but you can order small quantities of metals at really good prices. Like, a troy ounce of sterling is $24 at Monster compared to $27 at Rio. Not that that's a *huge* amount of money, but their prices for other supplies are quite cheaper. OR, another example, if you want 10 ft of sterling half-hard, 20 g, square wire, it's $19.50 from Rio and $15.66 from Monster. I have to say their customer service was awesome, too. Right after I ordered one 26 g. sheet I realized I'd meant to get 24 g. and emailed them. By the time they'd emailed me back, my whole (very large) order was already packed and ready to go. They took out the 26 g. sheet out of the order and sent the rest to me right away while I re-entered the order for the 24 g. sheet. They charged me the difference in price for the sheet, and then shipped the rest of the order for free. They could have just said, too bad, we already packed your order or held the whole order back to correct it, but no, they sent what they could and then sent the rest at no extra cost and had no problem with me correcting the order. They were so fast and so nice and their prices are considerably better for both base metals like I buy and sterling and other precious metal like you might buy. Sorry to bother you with this rave, I just happened to have a recent, really good experience with this company and they offer good prices at small quantities of metals and supplies.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I hace gotten so many terribly hurtful comments regarding my ED, such as it's all about vanity or that I choose to hate my body to the point of killing myself. I think the vanity comments sting the most because in reality I'm not starving my body and mind because I love the way I look, I'm doing it because I can't stand to even look myself in the mirror and see nothing but flaws.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Actually, the "but you look so great" is like, fuel to keep going because if I look great using the eating disorder then I gotta keep on going with the ED to keep looking great, right? I wouldn't blame anyone for saying that. If you don't understand something as complex as an ED I can't blame you. It's one of those things, like depression, that is just so hard to grasp and even imagine without first-hand experience. What would have helped me when I was in the thick of my ED is for someone to offer to listen and just not judge. Like, during the beginning my of ED, I said, "ugh I feel so fat" after a big meal with friends and I wasn't fishing for compliments, I felt like a blimp and just want to hide and be invisible and my best friend said, "ugh, yeah right. Like *you* could feel fat" and gave me this hateful look and it was like engrained in me that I could never talk to anyone about how I was feeling and from then on I *never* tried to open up about what was going on. All my friends who knew talked about me behind my back about how "concerned" they were. Some of them were truly concerned, some wanted shit to talk about me, some just wanted the drama, but I wish just one of them would have come to me and let me talk about it for once. But I guess to answer your question after my monologue... if you just want to say something supportive that won't end in a huge heart-to-heart conversation, you can say, "you look beautiful/fine/pretty at any size" and try to sound like you mean it. It would be supportive without trivializing anything and won't encourage the person w/the ED to keep going.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Oh, I was that way, too. I wanted people to think I looked gaunt. I wanted to not be there anymore. I wanted people to look at me and think, god she's skinny. I was the "skinny girl" at work once another girl with an ED who was even more skeletal than me got fired. At the same time I didn't want to look at myself and have to face the fact that I had a serious problem. I wasn't being vain like I thought skeletal looked good. I'd rather no one look at me at all, but since that's not an option if they're going to look at me at all I want "skinny" to be my first impression because I thought that was the best thing about me. My personality was nothing. I wasn't pretty. The best I could offer was to be skinny so that's what I did. At the same time I still didn't feel good about the skinniness about me, it was a compulsion and sickness. ED is all about dichotomies and opposites. Probably nothing I said really makes sense. In the end though, if your eating disorder makes you feel beautiful and you do it, look in the mirror, and feel true happiness and confidence the way a healthy person would from eating right and working out, it's probably not a really an eating disorder. I feel like vanity isn't a key component of ED at all. But like you said, EDs are complex and I'm certainly not aware of every facet of the disorder.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Where are you going to school, if you don't mind me asking? I started about 6 months ago at a for-profit and so far enjoy it and am excelling because I put a lot of effort into it and have observed fellow classmates run the gamut from no effort whatsoever to trying as hard as I am, but I've also already gotten a degree from a public university and have observed the exact same thing. Some classes are so easy all we do is listen to the prof drone on and on and on then take 3 easy exams and whammo, we get an A. Other times there are profs who make you work for your grade and push you to try harder. I saw nothing in that article's description about for-profits that wasn't observable in a public university, either. And, I've seen so semblance of employment from *that* degree either. I also spent almost as much money on that degree as I'l be spending on this one, so, I'm not doubting my decision either.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This may make me biased, but I disagree with this article. I'm not attending an AI school right now, but it is a for-profit. The article states that some classes put forth no effort, they just sit in you in front of a video or send you to a museum. That's more effort than a lot of classes I attended when I got my first degree at a highly-rated *public* university where you are talked at by a lecturer who never learns your name or even your face, who you never even spoke to directly even once. Then you take 3 incredibly easy exams and get your A, along with 90% of the class and get your credit and move on. You also have your classmates who run the gamut from not trying even the tiniest amount then there are classmates who bust their asses, along with you. It's the same anywhere you go. Granted, this university took a lot more effort to get into and had much higher requirements, but once you got in, you were one of thens of thousands of undergrads (literally) who they couldn't care less about unless you forgot tuition or started failing every class, in which case they still didn't care more than what it took to kick you out. I still haven't found gainful employment from that degree, even 3 years later, and I sent out hundreds of resumes, for "entry-level" work and even as a goddamn secretary and still, experience counted much more than a degree so no matter where your degree comes from, it's equally worthless if it's only an undergrad. I received no help whatsoever from career services, they couldn't have cared less that I existed and I spent almost as much on that degree as I will have paid for this one. They're making a straw man out of graduates from public universities, except this straw man is being overly praised instead of the opposite.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm not sure what kind of texture you're going for, but I assume a hammered kind of texture? I'm not sure how to hammer metal without stretching it, but you can get texture other ways that might look a little different. You could try acid-etching it. You could use the mask part to create all kinds of patterns. You won't get exactly the same look as from a dapping hammer or chasing tools, but it is one way to achieve texture without stretching.</TEXT>

I also love copper and mixing it with other base metals or fire-painting, but it's certainly a shame it's not very popular with others and considered a junk metal. I always read jewelry books that say to practice on some copper laying around, but I like to feature it in my pieces if I'm making it for myself, especially, like this pin I made a while ago with little copper flowers soldered onto nickel: http://i.imgur.com/MuGWnbT.jpg</TEXT>

    <TEXT>While this isn't exactly why you're asking for, I'd like to let you know the kind of hell you saved your child from having to go through. My brother has a really rare genetic disorder that caused kidney failure when he was in junior high, maybe 12 or 13? From then on he went through dialysis for years and missed out on very formative years of his life. He got lucky with a kidney transplant when he was about 15, but that rejected and almost killed him. He went back on dialysis, we tried hemo from home which was hell on the whole family, especially my parents who had to actually do all the work, and he still missed out on a real life because of the complications. He got lucky again with another kidney after graduating high school, which he kept this time. Even with a good match, having a transplanted kidney is still hell. He finally got to go on his Make-A-Wish trip and it literally almost killed him when hi kidney got infected and almost rejected. He's only 28 now and last year his kidney finally gave out and he'd back on dialysis. Even when you get a kidney, life is never easy and when you don't have one it can be hell at the best of times. I know a day hasn't gone by in the past several years when my brother hasn't wished he was never born and my parents wish they'd never brought my brother into this hell of a life, with great guilt they feel this, too. Trust me, the guilt you feel now and especially that of your husband doesn't compare to the guilt you'd feel had you watched your child miss out on every good moment in life because of this health problem. I know it doesn't feel like it now, but you did him a favor by not inflicting a health problem on him. My family suffers from myriad health problems, myself included. Good health is the most valuable thing in life and bad health can be a curse you never shake yourself of. I hope you and your husband find peace with your decision and learn to accept that you did the right thing, which you did. I also wish you all the luck if you try for another child.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have had two bad experiences with two bad Cricut machines. I first tried the mini and couldn't get a clean cut on even a 5" heart or 2" tall letters. I finally got a new blade housing sent to me from them and it still wouldn't com rout perfectly and it was the simplest heart shape ever. So I traded it in and upgraded for a little more money to the Expressions 1, the same machine you're seeing on sale, and the cuts were slightly better, not perfect still, but usable unlike the mini. Then, before I started a project, I had to upgrade the software or the machine or both, and I just *could not get it to work.* I was frustrated to tears so I checked online and read that you cannot, in any way, upgrade using a mac, which I have and so do the people I live with. The only option you have is to upgrade the machine with someone else's PC, then reconnect your mac to the upgraded machine, that is, until the next time they decide to change their software and then you have to do it all over again. If you have a pc this isn't an issue, but as a mac user I didn't feel like finding someone with a pc, hauling the machine to their house or vice versa, then repeating every time there's an update. It also didn't do anything perfectly so I looked for other options. I know you said you don't have the budget for a $300+ machine, but if you can stretch your money to like, $250, go for a Silhouette Cameo. And if you can't afford that, go for the cheaper Silhouette Portrait. I live and die by my Silhouette. You don't have to buy a single font or shape, ever, you can make everything you can imagine yourself or just buy a single design for as little as $1 or every $.50 when there's a sale and they have a free shape every month. You can download any font you can imagine for free online and then use it on the Silhouette. You can take any shape online and then trace it on the Silhouette for free or manipulate any shape yourself so easily. I've never had to buy a single font/shape ever and I've made probably 50+ completely original card designs, made a big paper flower wreath, I can't even remember how many amazing things I've made with it, all with crisp, sharp cuts. Many places have it on sale from it's retail price of $300 for like, $250 with a couple tools or gift card to their store. You'll spend much more on designs, fonts, and torn up paper to make up the difference in cost within a couple months, I bet.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I try to work non-destuctively as possible, so every time I go in for a new area of repairs I start a new layer so if I screw up it's easy to go back. I mostly use the clone stamp tool over the healing or spot healing for the tears because you don't want to maintain any of the color or texture beneath because it's damaged. On her face I had to go in with a brush to fix her teeth and the spots on her face. for the color I used masks with color fills and a color blending mode or overlay blending mode to maintain the tones beneath. I also used a filter- gt; noise- gt; reduce noise and pushed up the filter pretty hight to get rid of all the little spots. Feel free to ask if I wasn't clear on anything! Always happy to help if I can as a beginner!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My pump malfunctioned while I was asleep and didn't deliver insulin for 8 hours and obviously I didn't notice until I was awake and getting ready for work. Once you're in DKa, just insulin doesn't really take care of the problem. Even if you don't go to the ER, you need to be off your feet and making sure you're getting enough insulin. For me, once I'm super high, it takes a lot more insulin than my regular ratio to get down.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>yeah her work is amazing, it's just apparently she's booking appts. starting in January 2016 which is a long way off. My mom and I were going to do mother-daughter tattoos for mother's day and I was hoping to get it done sooner. We've talked about this for years and I've been wanting mine for a really long time so I was just looking to see if there's anyone as legit as her. I might just have to wait her out, I was even thinking of begging her to squeeze me in and then I realized how pathetic that was.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have one. I went home and was up and on my feet the same night after it was done. It was sore for a long time, like car rides would hurt when we hit a bump and when it got bumped, but it wasn't enough to keep me bedridden. I had a hard time healing and my incision wouldn't heal, but that was because I had a fall that pulled it open and I'm diabetic so we have a harder time healing. If you're worried about leaving your home unattended the most would be one night if they wanted to keep you under observation for some reason or there was complications from the surgery, but I walked out on my own feet from the hospital and was driven home by my dad the same day as surgery.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Make sure you reach out to the students with disabilities resources your school has and get in touch with them asap. Bring documentation of your pain and how it may hinder your abilities to get work done in time or make it almost impossible to get out of bed and get to you tests. I didn't do it at first when the pain started for me and just suffered alone and took the bad grades because I was in too much pain to take an exam, but also too much pain to get to the doctor to get a notes! Arrggg it's all so frustrating sometimes. But once you're established in the students with disabilities resource group, it'll be a LOT more easy to explain those inevitable absences with legitimate proof. After that, speak one on one with every instructor to explains face-to-face what you're dealing with that others aren't and that an unexcused absence could become as excused one if the issues at hand were discussed beforehand. I had to deal with a lot of red tape and bs myself during my college years that changed the whole idea of what I thought college was supposed to be for me because I couldn't let go of the pain and wasted too much time with "friends" who weren't there for me. Long story short: feel fee to pm me if you have any questions about how to deal with a particularly unsympathetic professor, friends who could;t care less that you're in pain, feeling like getting out of the bed in the morning for a day of classes would make you mentally/emotionally break into a million little pieces. I had no one else in my life to talk to about my demons and health issues, even my best friends, and I would have given *anything* to have anyone, a stranger online. I sought help too little too late and I would give everything to be able to go back and do everything all over again with the help from the right people. Sorry this is rambling, basically I'm saying pm me any time, any day, no matter how seemingly insane the question might be, if I can help someone else going though this hell and come out a fully functioning person when you graduate. I kept to myself, never found anyone to give support and here I am now, unemployed because I let my physical problems snowball to the point that I can't handle a job that doesn't let me sit 90% of the time.</TEXT>

So several weeks later I get the permanent SCS, and btw the surgery was a bitch, and finally realized it wasn't doing anything for me. It even got to a point that I just stopped turning it on at all and the thing actually died. I think the battery went dead or something, at any rate it won't turn on anymore. I don't want this to discourage you, though, because for some people I know it did a world of good, but for me I'm still on pain killers and other meds to deal with the chronic pain.

    <TEXT>For me, it was kind of painful. First they use this thingy to conduct electricity through your nerves and measure how fast your nerves are working (I think, it's been a while I may have this wrong). This was kind of painful, but the worst part is when they use a needle and stick that in you to measure your nerves. It's about the size of an acupuncture needle so it's not all that bad, but it still hurt for me, especially when they wiggle it around to get to the right area. Not to scare you or anything, it wasn't all that bad, but certainly painful at the time. Mine said they couldn't detect much damage, but my pain specialist was pretty certain I had some major damage because of poor control of my diabetes in the past so I dunno how helpful I found it. They seemed kind of uncertain what the test even showed to be honest. Good luck with yours!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For the record: I have been in an eating disorder clinic and come across cases of girls who very well could be "triggered" (I hate what that word has become). One girl was freaking terrified of gaining weight she counted things down the fractions of calories so getting out of that habit is a big part of recovery. If she's making the choice to get fast food, which is a big step for someone with an ED) and she's bombarded with those same demons she had before, she's going to become a human calculator and go back to that bad habit. That being said, I don't think that the chance of a recovering anorexic being triggered by calorie counts outweighs the health of a nation that desperately needs to become more aware of the garbage and high calorie foods we consume.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I unfortunately had a negative experience with my SCS. I tried the trial and kind of convinced myself it helped, while now that I look back I should have never gotten the permanent one. It just felt like when your legs fall asleep and then they're waking up and kind of jittery and that not quite pins-and-needles feeling, but tingly. It didn't mask any of my pain, it just added more white noise to it, I would put it that way I guess. My pain in kind of indeterminate, though, not a fast and hard diagnosis like a lot of people here. We've kind of decided I've got diabetic neuropathy and fibromyalgia, but those aren't diagnosable by any lab tests or MRIs or X-rays (other than an EMG test that showed nerve damage), so maybe I'm not the best candidate to judge by. I wasn't able to decrease any of my meds like opiates or anything so it was just kind of a bust for me in the end. My stimulator has actually broken. Medtronic sent someone to swap out the chargers (the old ones were recalled because they heated up too much) and when we tried to test it, nothing happened. It had been so long since I even used the thing that I didn't know it had broken. My mom wants me to get it removed, but I don't know, I guess I'm waiting until I think it's a problem. I hope I didn't burst your bubble and I also hope that if you go through with it that it's much more successful for you! Good luck!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I.... did this on and off for almost 10 years, with several years when I never stopped taking insulin. seriously it was like 8 mml a day or something ridiculous like that, so... yeah, it works. Granted I didn't completely stop taking my insulin, but I'd turn my pump off at night to get those skinny skinny ketones to build up even more. It truly was a sickness, both mental and physical, that I could not break. I had A1Cs so high sometimes they couldn't actually measure them (this was told to me by a new endocrinologist who instantly hated me when she saw how thin I was and new what I was doing. Instead of helping, she decided to shame me and make me feel like dirt so that may have been an exaggeration). TLDR: yes this totally happens. I've even had the thought "welp, time to turn off the ol' pump for a day or so" when I saw I had gained even an ounce or when I was trying to recover on my own. But, if a casual acquaintance had said to me, "you look great" (when I was just thin by restricting insulin, not by the time I was skeletal) I would *never* take that personally or think that person is insensitive because she didn't know I was in the throes of a dangerous eating disorder.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Cheese and rice, these people! From the body of the text, the one fat roll bulging out it is the freaking hypocrisy! First, she's all assertive about it's her body and its her decision to make it fat. If she were trying to be skinny (read: healthy) she's do something else, which is *not* what she's going to do. Then she goes on about beauty according to what the commenter thinks her body should look and how she's no victim of the patriarchy bringing us women down (ok, maybe that last bit was me assuming what she really means if she's had Ragen Chasten along to coach her through he reaction). *SHE* decided to make herself fat, or at least resume her fat lifestyle and *SHE* is the one who doesn't care what on man or any man thinks she should look. Next, she's the victim: She reacted with skipping lemonade for water and eating her "pathetic 6 inch" without chips because the comment made her remember she's not 100% confident with her body and this [comment] brought it to light. She even said she didn't even feel like eating at all (then still eats). Can't have it both weighs lady. Either you're the victim because it broke you already fragile ego or you're in charge of your body! Nobody's gonna tell her what to eat. She eats this way because she knows and wants it to make her fat.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>To be fair, a traumatic experience is not the only reason people develop EDs. I had an ED for years and never experiences a single trauma. And a big part of it was comparing myself to woman in popular media. I'm not saying that seeing a skinny woman on a fashion magazine *caused* the ED, but a big part of what I personally experienced was feeling inadequate and equating being skinny with being happy, feminine, beauty, etc. I was dealing with depression and just pressuring myself in general to be perfect and of course my body is part of that equation. It was also what I thought happiness was. No matter how shitty my life was in other arenas, if I could get skinny then I would suddenly be happy. Of course, I could never be skinny enough so I was constantly chasing the yardstick to which I measured happiness. This is just my personal experience, I just wanted to say that women in the media was actually a big part of my sickness.</TEXT>

If it were as simple as that no one would complain and the condition wouldn't be a thing. Meds to treat opioid-induced constipation wouldn't be created if it weren't a real problem. This goes for many other conditions, as well.

    <TEXT>Laxatives also make constipation even worse if used more than occasionally and to treat opioid-induced constipation with laxatives requires *constant* use of laxatives and this is coming from someone who's suffered from this condition for many years. Your body becomes reliant upon laxatives and even without opioids, you become constipated unless you don't take laxatives. And one thing no one's mentioned yet: it is an absolute pain in the ass (pun not intended) to treat constipation with laxatives. They create cramps, you become tethered to a toilet for sometimes a full 24 hours after taking them. It's not like you take them and have a nice BM and you're on your way. At least not for me. It's also embarrassing if you share a bathroom with anyone else.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've definitely been in the same situation. When my pain first set in I had to take a semester off of college. I also stopped eating like you. I'm 5'0" and lost I'd say 20ish pounds, which is a lot for a small frame, as you know. I would go days without eating and the only time I did was when my parents shoved food in my face. I don't know exactly what is was that caused this. I suppose with the pain I was in I just didn't enjoy anything, which included food so I had no desire to eat since I wouldn't enjoy it at all. And I used to *love* food. My situation is a little different in that I have actually had a diagnosed eating disorder in the past so my relationship with my body and food is kind of complicated. I thought I'd love to just lose my appetite and not want food so I'd be skinny easily when I was in the midst of an eating disorder, but when I was super skinny from the pain you definitely don't get to "enjoy" being skinnier. I have since gained the weight back and started eating under my own fruition again. Once we got the right combination of meds figured out, the pain subsided to the point that I could actually enjoy things again, get out of bed, and go back to school. How is your pain management now? What kind of pain are under (arthritis, fibromyalgia, etc.)? Hopefully once you figure out the right combination of meds and get everything under control, or at least to the point you can clean and live a normalish life again you'll get your appetite back.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Agreed. I was put on an anti-psychotic and gained weight, too. At first I could *swear* my diet was the same, but I still gained weight. In reality I realized I truly was eating more. The meds may make you gain weight, but it's because your appetite increases and you consume more calories, the weight doesn't just magically appear. Secondly, I'm physically disabled, too, and there are still ways to lose weight. I cannot work out at all and physically therapy does nothing for me, *but* you can always always always just watch your calorie intake. The people need to take some goddamn responsibility for once.</TEXT>

I didn't watch the whole thing, but do they ever touch on the fact that she's got problems with food herself and not just too few calories, but real deep-down issues with weight gain and food being scary? It just seems they only underscore *his* problematic eating habits.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm a type 1 diabetic and for a period of time I just wasn't taking care of myself, wasn't testing, my A1Cs were way too high, I was abusing my body terribly and causing irreparable damage to body. And what did my doctors do? They yelled at me, shamed me for being so negligent and that's exactly what I needed to hear. I did not need to be coddled and gently asked to get my shit together. And what these obese people are doing is just as damaging as what I was doing during that period of time. Just reading that article pissed me off and made my blood boil that healthcare workers are made to walk on eggshells around obese people and pretend it's not happening. Ugh, I just needed to vent after reading that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hello, 28 years old over here. My pain started my sophomore year of college, so not as early as you and some others here. What I hate about it, well *one* thing I hate about it is that's an invisible condition many times. I don't look sick, I don't have a wheelchair or a limp, but it takes a lot of effort to do anything even if it doesn't look like it. I sat down on a bus and this lady, with hands full of shopping bags from a day of shopping, gives me he dirtiest look. The bus was full and she demanded my seat because she's old and I'm not. I pointed out that, a. I wasn't even in a handicap seat and b. I'm disable myself. On top of that I'm a type 1 diabetic and my blood sugar was really look and I needed to sit down and let the juice I just drank sink in and bring my sugars back up. I hate having to explain everything to people I meet for the first time. They ask where I work, but I don't because of the pain and some other health conditions and when they push at why I don't work or why I spend all my time at home, I'm forced to say I'm disabled as an explanation hoping that will satisfy and change the subject. Then I get at best looks of confusion ("you don't look sick") or even looks of contempt like I'm faking it. Since my symptoms started early on in college, I missed out on mostly everything that college is supposed to be. My friends abandoned me once I could no longer go partying with them because that's all they did for fun. My roommates kicked me out of my apartment because they didn't want to risk me not coming back to school (I had to take a semester off because I couldn't function once the pain set in), which broke me heart because they were supposed to be my best friends. They replaced me in a heartbeat and once I came back to school I felt like a ghost. I'm still relatively young, you enough to still party a little, go to bars, etc. but I can't because of myriad health conditions. It sucks sitting at home watching everyone enjoying their lives and you're lucky to not hate your life. I'm sorry you got hit by pain problems so young, I can't imagine missing out on those formative years of life, or at least missing out on a lot of what makes those years fun/tolerable. I don't have really any friends like you and it hurts a lot when I have no one to call or anyone calling me besides my parents. Hopefully you've found some people here with common ground who can at least understand your situation and relate a little bit.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>When I had a real ED, as in diagnosed and did in-patient treatment with lots of other ED-having people, a diet plan was like, the top of the list of things to stay on. They didn't just open up a pantry and say, "go for it! everything and anything, as much as you want!" You start off with a strict diet plan because most people with anorexia have no idea how to eat healthily anymore, or just refuse to. Eventually the goal is to learn "intuitive eating" meaning you eat when you are truly hungry and stop before being bloated from eating too much. So, learn to eat like you're on a diet plan without actually being on one. Again, this isn't saying life is now a free-for-all, eat as much as you want! If a trainer offered to construct a diet plan, I'm sure most of the people I met in treatment would either take the advice willingly or kindly refuse, not run out of the gym crying.</TEXT>

Even after treatment and all that now that I'm in "recovery" I don't tell a soul because they look at you differently and constantly worry if you say the word "calorie." These people definitely have an ED, but it's called binge-eating disorder, not anorexia because you once skipped a meal or went 2 hours without eating and felt kinda hungry once. But they'd never admit *that* they just want you to know they have an ED and make it sound like they're restricting. For fucks sake.</TEXT>

I don't know whether or not that's true, that's not my problem. My problem is that even if we went by a waist-based metric to measure for obesity, most of the people who are overweight and obese would still be overweight and obese, maybe even more people who are "normal" weight would go into the overweight category if we measured their waists. Does she really think this new obesity indicator would somehow absolve all the people who are grossly obese according to their weight? As if the 300+ lb. people walking around somehow have 27" waists.</TEXT>

If anything, it would be a class issue since the more money you have, the more food you can buy, which would imply that if anything, thin-phobia would be a race issue. You'd eat more of what you can afford to differentiate yourself from the lowly serfs who couldn't afford enough food. Today, you don't have to be rich to afford to be fat, *but* this statement talks about the roots of fat phobia starting in the 1800s when easily produced and attained food wasn't a thing yet. That's part of modern times more than anything with cheap fast food and junk.</TEXT>

Poor people then and up until very recently couldn't afford to be fat. If anything, thin phobia would have been a thing if people were truly trying to differentiate themselves from "lesser" cultures.

Funny enough, I went to the doctor twice complaining of a UTI and they wouldn't believe me and treated me for anything *but* a UTI and guess what? Both times a UTI. I got to pay for a nice 3-day stay in the hospital because of that.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Can anyone offer help with a school assignment as a professional designer?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-09-10 13:50:33</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hello all, I'm still in design school, although getting near the end. For an assignment, I'm supposed to find someone already in the industry to give my portfolio a review and also answer some questions in an interview. The interview can be written, which I'd prefer to be honest since I keep odd hours and probably wouldn't be able to do it over Skype or whatever very easily. Anyway, it wouldn't be too much work and my portfolio admittedly isn't very expansive or strong, but I'd appreciate the help if someone has the time for a couple questions and to look over the work I've gotten done so far. Feel free to post on this thread or just shoot me a dm if your so inclined. Thanks!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Type 1 diabetics are thinner than type 2s because they have to take care of themselves or suffer deadly consequences whereas type 2s can go years before being uncontrolled will kill them. *But* type 1 can actually make it harder to lose weight than the average person because of low blood sugars basically forcing diabetics to eat empty calories they don't want in the first place. I track what I eat very carefully, but when I drop below 40 right before bed, there's at least 100 calories I didn't want nor make room for that day. Yes, it's not that much, but I'm 5'0" so those extra calories add up quickly. It also makes exercise difficult to manage because you have to figure out how much less insulin to take so that you don't go low and just eat back all the calories you just ran off in the first place. Arg I hate diabetes and there's nothing I can do about it. If I could just watch what I eat to manage my symptoms you can bet I'd be doing that in a heartbeat... if I wasn't already doing that.

    <TEXT>The thing is, a lot of FAs like to tout anorexia as some incurable condition that does irreversible damage to the body and cannot be treated. While my information is mostly anecdotal (actually spending a summer at an in-patient treatment center for EDs) it seems to me that the effects of anorexia are pretty easy to treat with a healthy diet and most of the dangerous conditions from being underweight are rectified for the most part. Whereas with being grossly obese, a lot of the ill effects *are* irreversible like heart damage, nerve damage and eye damage from diabetes or amputations, skin stretching etc. I wouldn't go so far as to say I'd rather treat being anorexic over treating being grossly obese... but I've seen very few lasting effects in recovering anorexics vs. someone who's spent a significant amount of time morbidly obese.</TEXT>

In the past, people as a whole either had more self-control or less access to high calorie, cheap foods so obesity wasn't a problem like it is today. Slim bodies have been desirable for a long time now, it's just that now people don't want to behave like people used to in order to get those slim bodies.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Even then with the contention that we scoff at anyone with an eating disorder who isn't skinny isn't totally true. We acknowledge that many fat people have eating disorders, such as BED. The only time we might scoff or raise an eyebrow is when a fat person says they have anorexia nervosa, which is patently not possible since having an underweight BMI is paramount to that diagnosis. We have a problem with FAs announcing they have eating disorders all the time and conflating anorexia nervosa with BED or considering counting calories as a sign of an eating disorder.</TEXT>

Is is that during a bulk you add mass in both muscle and fat, then try to just lose the fat when you cut so that your net gain is just muscle? Or am I still totally not getting it?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was about to comment exactly what you just said, well put! It's the fact that fat on the body signified wealth that made fat "attractive," but I would argue that the fat body itself was never the ideal in terms of *physical* attraction. I'm sure the fat wealthy women marrying fat wealthy men were lusting after the fit and muscular underlings who were tilling farms or doing whatever manual labor. The fat aristocratic men surely fathered a fair few children with the thin, curvy (in the good sense) women who cleaned their palaces or took care of their children. I have no sources on any of that, just what I believe is what was meant when people say fat was attractive in the old days.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>When my ED was taking off for the first time, I said after a huge dinner, "I feel so fat" and I really did! Like, I was looking in the mirror and saw a much bigger girl (dysmorphia is such a bitch). My best friend's reply was, "Oh give me a break, you're not fat. *I'm* fat." Had she said that reassuringly it might have helped me actually, but she said it with such vitriol and hatred towards me that I just decided right there that I can never talk about my ED with her. Which was awesome when I felt more alone than ever and needed someone to talk to more than anything so I went a very long time before admitting anything was wrong or that I needed help.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I basically have to eat 1000 a day. If I did 1200 I would lose .5 lb per *month* which is way to slow for me and I even tried it for months and I didn't even lose at that rate. I'm only 5'0" tall and extremely sedentary, so yes, 1000 is not enough for most people. (I'm also not sluggish or unable to think or do anything, it's only a 300-350 calorie deficit for me) The true fatlogic here isn't the "1000 is too low argument" but rather the people saying that eating that low will force your body to hold onto water and food and then eat your own muscle mass thus decreasing your metabolism *permanently* and all these claims are patently false.</TEXT>

That's why by the time it became more noticeable I would hide in bigger clothes so that no one would comment on my body or bulk up with multiple layers. Even then, I knew I wasn't fooling anybody but it helped lessen the number of gasps and worried comments as I lost more and more weight. I think my parents were actually a little more deluded in that they didn't want to admit/face the fact I had a serious problem so they kind of ignored it and told themselves it wasn't that bad.

    <TEXT>Unfortunately, my ED couple anorexia nervosa with something called "diabulimia" (which I absolutely hate!) and part of that entailed under-dosing my insulin and basically causing constant ketosis, which in a type1 diabetic is no bueno like it might be with veto dieters. Anyway, it deprives your body of fuel, so I was starving nerves, my eyes, my brain, along with myriad other effects. I think I'm having permanent cognitive disfunction because of the prolonged ED. I regret nothing in life more than that stupid ED, which has wrecked my health and my life permanently. I can't even read a damned book. Man, EDs such so much it just boils my blood when FAs co-opt the pain and suffering that comes with one because they once made themselves throw up or went 24 hours without eating one time.

    <TEXT>I don't even fully understand what he thinks is happening when people undoubtedly gain or lose weight at the same time as overeating or undereating, respectively. Like, when you overeat your furnace burns hotter and you don't gain weight from it, it *just so happens* that at the same time you overate, your hormones "dictated" to store more fat at that given point. Same with when someone undereats and loses weight. No, they didn't lose weight because they ate less than TDEE, it *just so happens* that at the same time you ate less, your body's hormones changed and dictated to release some fat. This guy is on a whole other planet with this one.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't know how the original conversation went or what was said regarding the two types and how the people who have them feel about the other, but as type 1 I will honestly say I hate being lumped in with type 2s. I wish they were a whole other disease because they have so little in common when it comes to treatment. Yes, the cause is our bodies don't make any/enough insulin or doesn't respond to the insulin your body does make. But past this point, the two are so different. You treat type 1 with insulin injections, they are unavoidable and absolutely necessary if you want to live. Carbs and sugars are fine, contrary to popular belief, as long as you bolus enough to cover those carbs (that is, with a pump, which most type1s use this days). I'm no expert in type2, but my understanding is that you have to watch your fast-acting sugars and carbs and are pretty limited. It gets worse and better with weight gain and loss, respectively. For many people, you can avoid it altogether if you stay a healthy weight and watch what you eat. They also tend to take some kind of medication such as metformin. Sorry to rant, part of this is frustration with my Diabetes Forecast magazine I was reading earlier. It has all these tips for diabetes! or breakthrough for diabetes! and when you read the article, you realize it and every other freaking article is about goddamn type 2 when the magazine was originally aimed towards type1s and America has just gotten so goddamned fat that the magazine is now all about the fatty diabetes. Ugh, sorry again, I just hate being conflate with type2s the most when people give me worthless and stupid advice because all they hear is "diabetes" and they rattle off whatever horrible women's magazine has said about how to treat it that has nothing to do with me.

    <TEXT>Thank you for explaining this better than I could. I have a pump, which I'm sure you do, too, since you have a CGM. Some people don't understand that even when you're high you can just take more insulin in a bolus and come down just the same. I don't know if this person is on the pump, but it's easy to make judgments when you don't have the disease and don't understand all the nuances and horrible consequences. I hate the rebound from going low, just like in the picture, but it can last waaaay to long to go without eating if it's in the middle of the day especially. Arg there's so much I want to say about this post, but can't explain well enough.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Other people have clarified this specific trainer, but there's also this show I saw on the Health and Fitness channel called "fat to fit to fat" where a trainer gains a bunch of weight and gets a fat client. He gains the weight then starts training alongside the fat client to help gain perspective on the situation and show solidarity, but also to show that it's possible to shed the pounds. I actually watched as many as I could when it was on because I found it interesting.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was just cruising Banana Republic online and saw some things that I liked. I saw a blazer that was crazy on sale and was so excited, but when I switched the page to petite sizes it was still regular price (even though that's *less* fabric). I shrugged and thought, oh well, I'll wait till those are on sale, too. There were actually many items at different sale prices depending on whether they were regular, tall, or petite. It just happens and is not an attack on who you are as a person.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Another related part of the article said "another possibility is that our bodies have evolved to metabolize sugars in a way that's triggered not by calories or the sugar molecule but by the perception of sweet taste." How does that work? I don't understand how artificial sweetener *are* so low in calories at a molecular level, but as far as I'm aware, so I may be interpreting this incorrectly, but is he/she saying that we've evolved to metabolize energy from artificial sweeteners? Cus that sounds kinda crazy to me. But I may be mis understanding/reading this part completely.</TEXT>

I'm not sure if that applies to type 2s or if a lot of them just lie to the DMV, but I would hope all diabetics have to jump through the same hoops, especially a commercial truck driver.

You highlight the good and take focus off the bad, not that the designer did that (I'm split on that issue). There have been past "real" women episodes where the designer didn't make a very flattering design and the first thing the judges did was point that out. Had that gunt been highlighted I bet you a million bucks they would have chided him for not working with her body to make something flattering. I mean, I love me some Project Runway, but once they accounted that they'd be using women with "real" bodies for *every* show, I was like, ugh, goodnight.</TEXT>

I get that the models will be switched up every episode so every designer has a chance with a "real" model vs. a size 2 or whatever, but how do you expect someone to make something as flattering on a larger body as a smaller one? From the one episode I watched, it seemed like pandering to me that they were so gaga about the bigger bodies. Admit it, clothes just look objectively better on thinner bodies than larger ones. They just do.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If you have a trainer I assume you exercise somewhat seriously, in which case I would say to not go below 1200. I'm the same height as you and have almost the same goal so I know how hard it is to lose weight when you're so short. I get away with about 1000/day, but that's only because I am unavoidably very sedentary with about 2 hours yoga/week. If I were active or had a trainer I don't think I would dip below 1200/day. But YMMMV. At any rate, 600-800/day is definitely too low and will result in malnourishment or a major binge once you can't handle it any longer, both of which are bad.

    <TEXT>I think it's them once again usurping a component of recovering from a legit ED. When I was in treatment, we weren't allowed to see our weights when we weighed in every morning because the number could be a real trigger for some patients. Even seeing a scale can be a trigger, like going to the gym and walking by a scale everyday could be a major temptation to see your weight and then obsess over it, think about relapsing because of it, restricting/bingeing again because of it, etc. etc. There was one girl who had such strong feelings and triggering from her scale we all went outside and she smashed hers up with a sledgehammer. After treatment, we're encouraged not to weigh ourselves and ask for blind weights at the doc's until we're at a place where that number will no longer trigger such strong feelings. TL;DR: FAs are once again stealing language/behaviors/advice for people recovering from EDs and using it to justify their inane behavior.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was going to post my own fatrant about this today, partially because I think my parents are tired of me bitching every time a pro-repeal commercial is on the tv. I cannot believe this attitude about pop being a basic human right and "how am I going to afford to buy drinks for my kids now?" shit. Ugh, I get heated up every time. Another argument is that it targets poor people more than middle class and up. I asked for some reasoning on this and someone said "because of the tax, poor people can't afford pop, but rich people can, that's not fair" and I'm like, its a luxury! Of course rich people can afford more expensive things than poor people, but we're not talking about water or shelter, we're talking about sugar water. You could say the same thing about cigarettes, which are taxed to hell. Rich people can afford them more than poor people, but no one's protesting about that. I see the pop tax the same as the cigarette taxes: it makes something completely unnecessary and in many cases detrimental to health more expensive and helps to discourage people from consuming them, but of course no one sees how toxic sugar drinks are. The bill could use some finessing, in my opinion, like how diet drinks are taxed, too, which I think is pretty ridiculous. Of course they are also a luxury, but at least they aren't contributing to the obesity epidemic directly. Sorry this turned into my own huge rant, I just have no one to talk about this with.</TEXT>

My primary care doctor, which is important because they can follow trends in your weight and notice dips or spikes that might indicate something more serious is going on. The other is an endocrinologist and the reason for being weighed there is the same as with my primary since she's my diabetes doctor, basically, and changes in weight can point to *major* problems with my diabetes. Out of my ophthalmologist/optometrist, podiatrist, psychiatrist, dentist, pain management doctor, and dermatologist {that's all I can think of right now) none of them weigh me because it's silly to weigh someone when you're treating them for acne or depression or a cavity. My point after all that rambling is even as someone with myriad health issues, only two of my doctors weigh me, so for them to be seeing their doctors so often speaks to the health of those who rant about this.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My city (Chicago) attempted a couple times to put a tax on sugary sweetened beverages like pop, any not 100% juice drinks, etc. and people had a *shit fit*. It's funny how any other taxes being imposed in the city have never heard more than a complaint from one another or groveling, but never the way this tax has upset the Chicagoans. There are tv commercials of a woman saying, "I'm a single parent, how am I supposed to afford my kids' drinks?" as if pop is a god-given right and water isn't an acceptable drink. For the record, the bill needed a lot of finessing to get it right, but at least it was a step in the right direction. I see sugary drinks/soda/etc. similar to how I see cigarettes; both are addictive; the body doesn't need either in any way, shape, or form (except type 1 diabetics who might need it for hypoglycemic attacks); and they are a privilege, not a right. So why not tax it like cigarettes are taxed to hell.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I know you already edited you comment, but just to throw some anecdata at you: I'm 5'0" and extremely sedentary (physical disabilities and health problems) so I also have little lean mass (working on that a little), but all that means I have a TDEE of about 1350. So if I went with the 1200 cal/day that is recommended for some, that would be a weekly deficit of 1050. It would take *over* 3 weeks to lose a single pound, which can get really discouraging. Since I'm so sedentary, I can easily handle a 1000 goal as long as I don't get a hypoglycemic episode that forces another 100+ calories into my day. It also allows for a cheat day here and there that won't completely erase my deficit from the days before it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think "brittle" diabetics tend to seek them out. I'm brittle and it means I can go really high or really low at the drop of a hat and sometimes the symptoms don't quite keep up with the blood sugar and I don't notice till I'm sky high or about to pass out. The dogabetics are especially helpful with those kinds of people, but they're not particularly common, I think. I thought about getting one once, but when I was researching I could only find dogabetics that were Portuguese water dogs and I needed a smaller dog so I never went any further. They can also be enormously expensive and insurance usually isn't too helpful with things like this.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm sorry my reply made you go through the effort of posting pics for proof, I swear I wasn't doubting you or calling you a liar, I hope it didn't come off that way. I guess I was mostly just surprised that someone your height and weight of 160 lb. at the time had you wearing a size 16. I think all those size 10s on mybodygallery might be *hoping* they wear a 10 or have some seriously vanity-sized clothing or something. I was originally thinking, "well, bernadine77 is average height and less than average weight, but she wears a 16, which is the new average size of women (at least in America). That seems odd, those people on mybodygallery don't *look* like a size 16." Then I looked up the average weight and it's actually 166 lb. so a 5'4", 160 lb. woman would be the embodiment of average and the average size is 16 so all the math adds up now. I don't know why I was so surprised someone with your stats would be wearing a 16, but I was, so sorry about that. I think maybe with vanity sizing 16s are bigger these days or people are just lying about their sizes so I don't even know what a size 16 body even looks like anymore. Oh, well, sorry if it seemed like I was doubting you.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Food moralizing is assigning "good" or "bad" to foods like junk food is bad and fruit is good, which kind of implies if you eat "bad" foods then you yourself are bad or whatever (I think that's what it means). I know this sub has a problem (rightfully so) with some people who say things like, "Of god, I can't even *imagine* eating 4 taco bell burritos at once, gross!" because it's kind of implying that person is better because they'd *never* do something as gross as pig out on junk. But sometimes things like what you said are fine to say, in my opinion at least. Some people can go through 7k+ calories in a day without batting an eye, but some, like you or me, couldn't even imagine doing that, not because we're better people who know how to abstain from such behavior, but just because our bodies literally could not handle that volume of food or the kinds of foods that would add up to 7k+ calories a day. I dunno now I'm rambling again. At any rate, you do you.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My type 1 diabetes is really getting in the way of my weight loss right now. In order to be in good control (low A1c) I have to keep my numbers low to the point where I go hypoglycemic at least once per day, sometimes 3 or more like yesterday. Each episode adds 120+ calories to my day, which means either it detracts from my deficit or I have to find room for those calories elsewhere. But since I have such a low TDEE (I'm 5'0", extremely sedentary due to disabilities, have little lean mass, but working on that), every little calorie counts and it doesn't take much to eat right up to my TDEE from the measly deficit I'm allowed to make (can't eat below 1000 calories/day) or go right into a surplus for the day. And the only way to avoid these lows is to keep my blood sugar higher so it doesn't drop like it does when I'm at a good level (I'm extremely brittle), but that increases my A1c, which isn't stellar to begin with so I can't do that either! Ugh, there's no way to win until I get a new insulin pump with a continuous glucose monitor to help avoid the lows.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, as a type 1 diabetic who goes low at least daily if not 2-3 times a day, I can tell you your body does not always know what/how much it needs. When I go low, I crave food of any kind, not just the carbs that will increase my blood sugar. If I listen to my body and just binge on everything I can get my hands on that my body craves I feel better sooner, but then I rebound and go sky-fucking-high as a result. If I'm level headed and think (as well as one can think during a hypoglycemic episode) and limit what I eat to 30 or so grams of glucose, which tastes gross and I definitely don't crave, my blood sugar comes even faster and with minimal rebounding. So, no, do not listen to your body if your body tells you to do things detrimental to your health.</TEXT>

It also didn't "demonstrate that safe, long-term weight loss is not possible." It showed how people lie about what they eat and do, will try any fad diet other than calorie counting, that they actually *can* lose weight on these diets, but gain it all back when they *stop dieting*. Which according to their warped little minds proves that dieting doesn't work. Gross.</TEXT>

Sheesh, maybe /u/Hjklmnopi just misread what you meant? ...or maybe I did, too, I dunno anymore.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>When I was inpatient, I couldn't believe some of the bull they'd shove down our throats to convince us to gain weight, most of it backfiring. Like telling us never to count calories again, but that would mean we have no control over our weight and we'll simply reach our "set points," which won't be skinny, and that's where we should be. Great, tell a bunch of kids/teens/adults who are terrified of getting fat that quitting their eating disorder will inevitably make them fat. Offer no middle ground like, I dunno, healthy? I hope other treatment programs are better than mine because I got out of there in a worse place than I went in, just less emaciated.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, as a type 1 diabetic who attempted keto, but still managed to eat over my TDEE and gained weight I can tell you the weight does not "melt off" in the absence of carbs. The only way you're going to inadvertently melt weight off as a type 1 diabetic is by not taking insulin, but eating tons of carbs so you end up in DKA perpetually and lose weight rapidly.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Maybe expand it to all diabetes (type 1 and 2) since type 2 is so prevalent with the rise in obesity. Like someone else commented, type 1 is pretty treatable and not a death sentence nor is it as common as type 2. Type 2 is also very treatable, even verging on curable with a little responsibility (lose weight, exercise, eat healthily) but most people who get type 2 aren't responsible enough to effectively treat it and end up with more co-morbidities, which are draining the health insurance systems (in the US, at least). As far as type 1 not being a death sentence, though, I've had it since I was 4 years old so for the past 26 years I've dealt with it and I can tell you, through the disease itself and some of my own mental health problems, it has turned my life upside down. I would give anything to have never had it or even get it cured now. Pumps and CGMs are great and all, but not quite affordable to me and lots of others who have shitty american insurance. So, now that my rant is over... yes, eradicating diabetes in general would greatly improve quality of life, insurance costs, and the health of those inflicted with it. I'm not sure it's the one I would choose as the answer to this ask reddit post, personally, but it's a good option.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm no scientist, but I am a diabetic and I do believe that ketones are the result of a metabolic process that helps you to lose weight, not the other way around. Like, I sweat when I exercise so I'm burning calories, but spraying exogenous sweat onto my body won't make me burn calories because the sweat is just a result of burning calories, not the other way around. I very well may be wrong about the ketones, though, it's just my understanding of it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As a type 1 diabetic, I can attest to how much of a pain in the ass it is to be conscious of how many carbs I eat at once and to dose my insulin accurately. If I have a choice to buy a book that requires me to look up each ingredient for it's carb count then divide that number for each fucking ingredient for each fucking portion so that I don't go sky high you can bet your ass I'm gonna pass. Now, most people aren't diabetic, but it seems really stupid to me to withhold pertinent information like nutrition facts simply because you think people shouldn't worry about them and just trust him that he knows whats in their best interest.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>She recommends just saying "no thanks," which I'm *sure* she'd accept at face value and not assign even more fat phobic motives towards. I can imagine it: "Yet another CFRI occurred at my friend's recent birthday party. We were all enjoying our cake, I was cutting and passing out the pieces, but then this "friend" just *had* to announce to everyone that she wasn't having any cake. She says, "No thank you," as if al of us who did partake are inferior to her and her ability to refuse cake. Because if *she* can forgo a piece of cake, then the rest of us should be able to, too, right? No one abstains from cake without believing that we should *all* abstain from cake. It brought me back to my eating disordered days when I would refuse cake all the time, robbing myself of much needed nourishment and pleasure. You know the patriarchy has their grips on this women, who I might add was *quite* thin. She believes the lie that only skinny women are attractive to men and thus refuses the cake, afraid it will end up on her hips, which she could use, let me tell you. When she said, "No thank you," it really shifted the atmosphere of the room. We were all having fun and celebrating and then this act of fat phobia just brought all the energy down. Every one of us looked at our pieces and thought to ourselves, "do I *really* need this?" and planted that seed of doubt in our minds. So next time ladies, rethink if you *really* need to say no. Just ask for a smaller piece or take the whole piece and don't eat it." Next article: "Don't take the cake... unless you're going to eat all of it: how the patriarchy is forcing us to waste perfectly good cake"</TEXT>

I only saw the last hour or so of this episode. but from what I saw he was pretty nasty and didn't seem to be putting in any effort without someone really twisting his arm. I felt sad, but mostly because I felt so sad for poor Kathryn. Seeing how distraught she was and the shit she put up with hit a bit too close to home. I will admit I may feel a little more resentful towards him because someone in my immediate family was addicted to pretty much any drug he could abuse and I know firsthand how much it can ruin a family and Robert really embodied those awful qualities.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>On one hand I totally agree with you. On the other I had an addict in my immediate family and he seemingly had no power over the rest of us, but dan could he make life *hell* for us until someone gave in. I was actually the only who didn't give into the demands, but since I wasn't his parent (or GF/spouse like Kathryn) there wasn't that kind of love that compelled my parents into giving in. The fact that Robert was immobile also makes it seem even more illogical to give into demands, but addicts *always* find a way to make everyone else pay until they get what they want. I was so resentful towards my parents for giving in every time, but eventually I saw what they were dealing with once I moved back home and lived with the torture for a while. I mean, truth be told, if I were Kathryn I would have walked a long time ago. It's easier to say when you don't actually know and love this person, but I just can't imagine putting your own health and sanity on the back-burner to feed someone else's habit, no matter how much you love them, unless you're a parent; that does complicate things a lot more.</TEXT>

Addicts often "doctor shop" to get as much as they can (remember Steven Assante?), not that it was appropriate for any *one* doctor to prescribe opiates for pain cause my obesity in the first place, though. But yeah, over-prescribing has been a big ol' problem in the US for quite a while now, especially with big pharma having such a huge influence over politicians and how things are run in the medical world. It's also a lot easier to get a patient to pop a pill than to switch to a healthier lifestyle, especially when they're as far-gone as Robert. Not that that excuses it, of course, it's just the reality of the situation.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The only truth to #1 is a misguided view of a study taken out of context. The study, which I do not have at hand, showed that healthy weight people had higher death rates than overweight people, *BUT* the reason for this is that most people at the end of their lives waste away and thus enter into the healthy weight range at the end of their lives. Bingo, you got more people at a "healthy" weight dying than overweight. The healthy weight people also tended to be older than the overweight people, who were dying younger, whoda thunk? So no, overweight people are not healthier than healthy-weight people by any metric.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm in a similar boat health-wise. I've got chronic pain from fibro and sever nerve damage and also have major brain-fog from some damage done in my past so I can't work either. Luckily, I have really supportive parents who don't get on my back about working because they understand my limitations. I'm also not on disability, either, because my parents have been able to support us all and my health decline isn't really well-documented so it would be hard to prove. My docs could speak to how I'm unable to work now, but it would seem like a mystery as to how I got here and it's a headache I don't really need to go through, at least not yet. I also make crafts and *try* to sell on Etsy, although that's extremely slow-going. I hope life keeps going well for you (or as well as it can), or even improve if that's possible!

On one hand, I think they should be shown (with family's permission) as a sobering message attesting to the morbid consequences of getting so fat, *but* there are crazy FAs who would point at the surgery/weight loss process and go, "see! he would have never died if he never tried to lose weight or had the surgery! Losing weight kills!" and everyone else in that camp would jump on the bandwagon and the people who need to learn this lesson the most would be frightened into staying complacent and fat because of what the FAs say.</TEXT>

It's not good to spread misinformation because it leads to people believing the wrong things about a condition and then spreading that information which then leads to someone telling me, "just get out more and try not to dwell on the pain, that'll cure it" when they find out I have it (which has happened). I have fibro, it's not in my head. It was a result of physical trauma and hasn't been cured with an antidepressant. It took pain meds and other fibro meds to get it under control to the point that I could function or get out of bed.</TEXT>

If a diabetic doesn't get insulin, they *will* die, full-stop, no exceptions. A chronic pain sufferer not getting meds isn't *always* life-threatening. Life-changing and life-ruining, yes, but it doesn't always kill. I have both conditions so I know what it's like to suffer from both. If I had the choice I would choose diabetes over choleric pain any day of the week. Without pain meds I was verging on suicidal (and only verging because if I had killed myself, it would have *broken* my parents and I couldn't do that to them after all they've been through), wishing for my death every second, bed-bound and absolutely suffering every second. I get it. I just don't think it's accurate to say that pain meds = insulin when it comes to sustaining life.</TEXT>

I really do, I wish I didn't, but I do. Pain doesn't often directly kill someone. It can and it may drive one to suicide, but it doesn't have a 100% mortality rate that untreated diabetes does. I'm not comparing the two conditions and how they effect one's life. I'm just saying that it's not accurate to state that lack of pain meds = lack of insulin in terms of life sustainment. A diabetic without insulin *will* die a horrible, painful, prolonged death. A chronic pain sufferer without pain meds isn't always going to die. In fact it's not very often that one directly dies from chronic pain. Sudden, acute pain from trauma can send one into shock and kill you, that happens more often. But the conditions that cause death from chronic pain aren't definite like death from untreated diabetes is.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I am on bupropion as well as wellbutrin and abilify. Before the wellbutrin and abilify the bupropion was handling things pretty well, but then everything just kind of fell apart in my life and I went into a really deep funk. Suicidal ideations (the only reason they weren't serious is because I knew it would *destroy* my parents if I did and I couldn't do that to them after everything we've been through), no motivation, seldom showering, *never* seeing friends, canceling plans all the time, and hardly ever eating. I was on edge all the time, snapping at my family for every little thing. I must've been a nightmare to live with, my poor parents. I went to a psych because my bupropion was being prescribed by my PCP and they put me on abilify. It didn't take long for it to take effect and it *really* took the edge off. I made plans with friends again eventually, I got back into my hobbies I'd totally abandoned, I was actually happy at times, suicidal ideations went away. After a while I had put on quite a bit of weight and I thought it might have been the abilify so I stopped taking it without replacing it with anything else and immediately I was back into that awful funk and the weight I'd gained never came off at all after being off for months so I figured it was just a coincidence that I'd gained the weight at that time. I wasn't really eating before I went on it so once I came out of that fog I actually enjoyed food again so I gained weight. So I went back on and everything went back to how they were the first time around when I went on it and I've been on it ever since. I don't see friends a whole lot, but there are myriad other reasons for that other than the depression and medication. I still do my hobbies, I'm not a nightmare to live with for my parents anymore, I find happiness throughout the day. Not all the time, but it took that awful edge off that permeated every second of the day before. It's technically an antipsychotic, but it's used for depression a lot more commonly these days. I hope that helps a little? And I wish you luck in finding a medicine regimen that works for you and things get better.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks for answering. I thought I made it very clear that I wasn't at all judging and was simply coming from a place of ignorance. The continued ignorance and why people judge and I was trying to not be so ignorant. Thank you for sharing your own perspective with me. I have no first-hand knowledge of this stuff and I think it's better to get it from the horse's mouth, as in asking directly the person I asked who felt judged, instead of going to google and gettin god-knows-what kind of information. By telling me your situation I broaden my perspective and have less reason to judge at all, not that I was judging in the first place, since I now see the reasons behind extended breastfeeding. I don't know, if someone politely asked me why I breastfeed my 5-year-old and made it clear they weren't being judgmental, I would jump at the chance to educate someone on the concept and hopefully give one less person, or more depending on who sees the comment, a reason to judge or think it's weird to breastfeed extensively.</TEXT>

I was afraid a bunch of people were commenting on my comment to call me judgmental I kind of hid from the new messages. Anyway, I can see now from what you and others have shared with me why some women breastfeed extensively. I had no idea it was a thing until I saw the original comment I commented on. Like you I assumed the milk dried up at some point when they're still young, like 1 or maybe 2, and that was it. I can also see why the bonding would make it something to continue for longer for some mothers and their children. Thanks again for sharing!</TEXT>

In my opinion, persuading someone to buy something involves telling the consumer about all the great features it has that other products don't or highlighting the problems other products have that your's doesn't. You trying to convince someone that your product is the best one and the best use of money. Manipulation tactics aren't about the product, but about exploit the consumer's beliefs or feelings to get them to buy something. For example, the OP. The person does say "I have this great product that can keep your arteries open and soft and it's peer-reviewed and safe, etc. etc." (basically) and had she stopped there that would have been persuasion. Where she enters into manipulation territory is when she brings in the tragic story about how she saw someone die from preventable conditions (which, how would she know that?) that *she* could have helped with her product (again, how does she know that?) and she's just so passionate about it that she gave up a lucrative job she loved because it's just such an important cause to her now, it's bigger than her happiness. So she's exploiting your feelings. Your fear of dying from an unnamed preventable disease and your sympathy for the person who died in the store along with adoration for her selflessness that makes you think yourself, "I should get this miracle cure" in a way that just saying "these pills can help prevent a disease you probably don't have" wouldn't have. Another example you've already seen, I'm sure, are the commercials for the ASPCA with Sara McLaughlin singing "In the arms of the angels" playing over footage of these sick, pathetic animals looking at you with those pleading eyes and you can't *not* feel like you should be contributing and then you feel guilty if you don't. Manipulation tactics make you feel something to persuade you to take action whereas persuasion prompts you to think about something and use logic. Manipulation isn't always wrong or a bad thing. Sometimes facts aren't enough and you want your target to feel a connection to something to prompt their action, but it tends to be bad or seen as bad because it often exploits the feelings and insecurities of others, like an artist tweeting, "I guess no one cares that I haven't sold enough paintings to afford heat and food this month. I guess it's either a freezing house or empty bellies for my kids this week :( " It makes you feel guilty that her kids are suffering and you can help that by buying something from her. It's not honest. It's not "look at my latest piece I'm so proud of! I think it really captures my subject and brings out the true beauty of this world... etc etc" Anyway, I hope any of that made sense, I was kind of just rambling and trying to convey my understanding of the difference between persuasion and manipulation.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>What I originally meant and what you replied to a couple comments up is that manipulation of feelings is different from persuasion which is *using facts* not *manipulating facts*. If I want to sell you something honestly, I would tout how great its features are, point out where its competitors fall short, etc. That's not manipulating facts, which I would consider being untruthful with facts or half-truths. I never said that manipulating facts was ethical either, as you seem to be understanding. Manipulating facts is just as unethical as manipulating feelings. Using facts is a whole different animal to manipulating them.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I agree. I don't believe that medium means average and all other sizes adjust around that. That would be ludicrous since the average woman is quite overweight, at least in the US. I think that clothing should go by objective measurements. If the portion of the population that used to fit into mediums has become larger, you don't make the medium larger, the larger women or men should go up in size. If there were 100 smalls, 1,000 mediums, and 50 larges and some people are getting bigger, then make more larges to fit those growing women who used to be mediums. That's like making chairs bigger for obese people instead of the obese person taking responsibility and losing weight so they fit into a normal chair, a concept most people here are in agreement about.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think what /u/tjfmd is saying is that the weight is much more a symptom than the root cause. If someone is mentally and emotionally happy and healthy and wanted to be thin, they would go about it in a healthy way. They might not succeed, but starving oneself or purging after every meal isn't something a well-adjusted person would or could do, at least not for more than a couple times. But someone who's depressed, dealing with an abusive situation, feels utterly alone and isolated, for example, can lose weight drastically as a means of exerting control in the *one* way they feel like they actually can, whether that's the reality or not. Before I went into treatment for my ED, I thought it was just about wanting a thinner body. That I truly thought thinner was better and that I was never thin enough to be happy with myself. Something I learned through treatment and years of introspection is that I was depressed and felt rejected by every friend/crush from middle through high school and so I focused my attention on my body. I thought if I had the "perfect" body then everyone would like me and I'd be happy again. It was what I blamed everything bad on, illogically, of course, but that's the mental illness part of it. All the thoughts and actions surrounding an ED of someone deep into it are totally irrational. And all these factors can go the opposite direction like turning into a binge-eating disorder. It kind of depends on what the person things of as their lack of happiness and what would fill that void. Sometimes a former anorexic goes into treatment, doesn't adequately address how they got there and end up 3 or 4 times their anorexic weight because they just went the other way with their unresolved emotional/mental problems. One thing that helped me start to recover even before I went inpatient was that I'd finally found some friends once I hit my college years and felt like I was being accepted. I still needed a lot of work to get over the treatment and I relapsed many times for even longer periods of times before it finally stuck (fingers crossed). Sorry this turned in an essay, I was just trying to get out what I've figured out through my own introspection and experience with an ED, YMMV.</TEXT>

Stress *can* cause weight gain because it increases cortisol which can increase your insulin levels which increases your hunger. It doesn't magically deposit fat onto your body. And I am very well-acquainted with insulin-induced hunger as a type 1 diabetic. It's a bitch to deal with, but it doesn't cause weight gain unless you give into the cravings.</TEXT>

This author just appropriated all the relevant words and arguments from those conversations and shoehorned "fatness" into them instead. Identity politics is a very important concept, not just some internet SJW rant when it's about things you cannot control such as race or sexuality, but fatness as an identity is just absurd. These FAs see their entire selves revolving around being fat and act like the consequences they cause are some gross unfairness thrust upon them while in reality they are entirely in control of their fat identity. If they really wanted to and tried hard enough, they could eliminate their fat identity altogether, but of course they wouldn't acknowledge that in a million years.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think, perhaps, they're convoluting insulin reactions in a type 1 diabetic and a non-betic? If a type 1 betic doesn't take insulin, they lose weight rapidly. Their body just stores all the sugar in their blood, wreaking havoc on their entire system, and pee out the calories in the form of ketones (I may have the exact mechanisms wrong, but the basic result is right). Once a betic starts taking insulin again, they'll gain weight again, sometimes rapidly at firs if they restricted their insulin for a long time. This doesn't translate to a normal person. If a normal person gets a spike in insulin, it might trigger storage of fat, but that's only because you treated that insulin with carbs to bring your blood glucose back up. And if you get several spikes in insulin a day, but eat at or under your TDEE you won't store it as fat, you're body will just be able to use it for fuel. If, however, the insulin spikes are rebounded with such a surplus of carbs that you exceed your TDEE, then yes, that sugar will be converted to fat stores, the same way any excess calories would be.</TEXT>

The suffering from the lawyer letting it take several days for him to slowly and painfully die is cruel, but so is using someone else to commit suicide by jumping in front of their car and possibly/probably traumatizing them in the process, as well as making them feel like a killer, never mind the material cost to them. In the end though, the lawyer was a criminal for driving drunk and not stopping and helping when he hit someone with his car, but rather letting him languish in his garage for days to slowly and painfully die. The dead person was and wasn't a victim, that's ambiguous, but there doesn't necessarily have to be a victim for the lawyer to be a bad person.</TEXT>

They take up resources from medicare, which a lot of them are on because of their "disability," they require more nurses to help them when they're in the hospital, which they don't actually pay out of pocket themselves more, but the hospital has to staff, and those are only two of the myriad ways the preventable disease of obesity costs people in this country money they shouldn't have to pay. Even without socialized healthcare, obesity is a drain on healthcare that increases the premiums of healthier people to subsidize their sickness. Of course, that's the whole concept of private insurance: healthier people who don't need as much healthcare *partly* subsidizing those who use services more (who also pay a lot more), but the fact that obesity is entirely preventable means they are an unnecessary drain on all those participating in private healthcare.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Knowing FAs, I would say that their gripe is not like your situation. They're the kind of person to feel "shamed" if their lunch companion doesn't binge as much as they do. They'd feel "shamed" if the dieter ordered a salad because they're chowing down on a double cheeseburger instead. There's nothing wrong with eating either of those things, but these are the kind of people who read shame in anything and everything a thin person does.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well there you go. I'm disable and unable to do even a light workout. I've worked my way up to 30-60 min of light yoga every couple days, but that doesn't burn additional calories. I burn about 1350 calories in maintenance a day. [Here you go](https://i.imgur.com/pXMFzki.png) Those stats are all mine, except the body fat might be a little low as I have very little lean mass because of my inability to do regular exercise. My TDEE might actually be lower because my body fat% is probably higher. And in reality, I'm not even as active as sedentary. I cannot work (disabled) so I spend most of my time home sitting or laying down, occasionally walking around the house, up and down the stairs, etc, but really not nearly as much as your average sedentary person. So, my TDEE might be even lower than 1350, but there was no option for less-than-sedentary.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; Hijacking top comment to say that I #8217;m a part of this fb page and this person is actually the landlord venting and being facetious because he has a tenant who #8217;s doing this very thing to him.  gt; This is a comment from the landlord aka  #8220;choosing beggar #8221; that was posted here:  gt; I #8217;ll tell you exactly why. I am a very tolerant person and have had to deal with complete loser tenants for many years...but I realize that comes with the business. I have actually not been giving my tenant a hard time at all and have let him chip away at his back rent a little at a time. He promised to catch up when he got his income taxes back, but instead went and bought himself a new TV and has to get drunk every night. He told me several weeks ago that he was going to move out, so I said go ahead...he can keep the $400 he owes me as his security deposit return... but then he threatens that he will squat and not pay anything. He has continued to live there and is paying his $100 per week...so I just asked him last night if he was planning on staying.... but he replied with a rant about how he #8217;s sick of living there and has to deal with so much bullshit, blah blah blah. I told him no problem and to just let me know when he finds another place...no hard feelings at all. Then this morning he makes a derogatory post on his Facebook page claiming that I #8217;m a slum lord and will rent to any scumbag. He is partially correct. This was commented on another comment, just to give some context to the post and why the person in red is being so open about their scumminess.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>All that and that bs about "some people [...] pack on more weight because they produce too much insulin." Yeah no. The only reason you'd produce "too much" is if you flooded your body with simple sugars and your body overcompensated and gave you too much insulin causing more cravings for carbs to treat it. Your body doesn't magically pump out extra insulin without stimulus and even if it did, insulin doesn't make you fat. It makes it possible to convert calories into body fat, but that's only if you consume a surplus of calories than you need for fuel in the first place.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For a while I didn't have a problem cutting, but in the last 3-4 months something's happened to my appetite and I'm hungry something *fierce* all the time. Actually, it's usually after I've started eating for the day then I'm just like, constantly eating after that for hours so I've been sticking to IF, which is basically what I did before to stick to the 1000/day and worked. The only problem is I like to eat in the middle of the day, but I'm T1 diabetic and I go low usually once/day and can't always account for/plan for the calories required to treat it. So I'll be at like 989 and feeling good about the day then right before I go to bed I test and I'm 48 which takes at least 100+ calories work of glucose to treat. And 1000 is already so low it's not like I can only eat 800 on the chance that I'll go low later that day. I could always just eat a snack before bed whether I'm low or not and just plan for it, but I like to eat a big meal and a dessert and that 100-200 calories figures a lot into that one eating window. Such is the life of a diabetic shorty.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think part of her mental block in understanding the points you just made is ballet is subjective in quality. No one would deny that being thinner as a runner helps because it's in the numbers. The fastest runners are thinner, well-built, muscular, etc. There are no fat cross-country runner performing at an elite level. Same with other sports such as soccer, gymnastics, tennis, etc. The best players are all thinner/fitter because excess fat hinders their performances. There aren't any fat soccer players being looked over because if they could play as well as the fit players and score the same amount of goals/assists/prevent goals/etc., they'd play for am major team. They simply cannot when they're fat. Ballet is different, though. There are no numbers to go by objectively that show that thinner is better. It's easier for her to convince herself she's just as good at the thinner dancers because quality dancing isn't as quantifiable in quality like running a race or performance in another post is. If she saw herself dancing side-by-side to a thinner dancer maybe it would sink in that she's not as good as she thinks because of excess weight.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>What you're perceiving as "cardio hate" I think is just saying you shouldn't rely on cardio for your primary mode of weight loss. Cardio is great; anyone who is able to do cardio should try to get some in, but when it comes to weight loss it's better to eat 500 calories less to achieve a deficit than to eat maintenance and work off that kind of deficit. I think a lot of people overestimate how many calories they burn while doing cardio, too, which could lead to slower progress.</TEXT>

So they both hunt the same stuff. They are also hunted 'by' the same stuff. So they hang out together so that they can alert each other to danger and since they are going to be hunting in the same areas anyway. They basically always hang out together when out and about so those pups are used to those birds. The flopping around is just like the play behaviour your dog and cats have made you familiar with.

My dog was a stray so we have to be *really* careful with her food because she will eat anything and everything as fast as she possibly can because she still feels like she might not get her next meal or that another animal will steal it from her. Giving an animal who's food insecure free reign over their food and make the decision of how much is enough is about the worst thing you could do because in every case all-the-food will be enough for them, not an amount that's healthy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, that's always my reaction to the "insulin makes you fat" argument. If you have high levels of insulin, that means you're eating high levels of carbs that need the insulin to go from the blood into your body system where it's used as fuel (in simplistic terms). If you're not eating those carbs then your insulin response isn't triggered. The only way insulin can possibly initiate weight gain is if your body has all the fuel it needs and you eat more calories in which case your body will then convert the surplus calories into backup fuel, i.e. fat, and insulin would be involved with the calories from carbs in that process (again, very simplistically). These people act like your body's just releasing insulin willy-nilly just because and making fat out of fuel that you never consumed in the first place. Even if the theory that artificial sweeteners cause weight gain by triggering an insulin response are true, all that means is your blood sugar is dropping a little and you compensate with some carbs as a response, which then *can* turn to fat if those calories are surplus. You could even get a big dose of insulin, go low, *not treat with food* and recover when your body reacts to the low with glucagon from your liver, but I can definitely understand not going that route as low blood sugars are scary and just plain awful feeling.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Man, the mental gymnastics some people go through just boggle the mind sometimes. The thing is, though, fatphobia is actually appropriate for describing some people in that they don't hate fat/fat people, they just don't want to be fat themselves. Although phobias imply an *irrational* fear and a fear of becoming fat certainly isn't irrational unless in the context of a legit ED.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The thing is, though, I don't think of the effects of weight loss as a negative part of weight loss, I consider it a consequence of getting fat in the first place. Like, some FAs argue that it's not worth it to lose weight since you'll have loose skin afterwards and you won't have the perfect body anyway. But the loose skin isn't because you lost weight, it's because you gained so much weight to stretch it out in the first place. If people are having aches and pains after losing weight, which kind of perplexes me since you're taking a lot of strain off of your body by losing weight, it's probably because the excess weight you gained in the first place strained your body in one way and losing the weight changes your center of gravity and fat distribution so that you have to carry yourself differently, probably in a more natural and healthy way that you should have been carrying yourself in the first place had you not gotten fat.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The only example I can think of is this one participant on "My 600 lb. Life" who had a huge gunt that made her kind of lean back as she walked to balance out the weight in front. At one point she had that growth/skin/whatever it was removed and all of a sudden she had to learn to carry herself dramatically differently from a few days before when she had the surgery. But that's an extreme and isolated case so most of this rant is just hyperbole.</TEXT>

I seem to have a *ton* of clothes, but really I have a normal wardrobe for 3-4 different weight groups I encounter throughout life. The first time I lost weight I got rid of my "fat clothes," some of which were really nice, got fat again and really regretted giving that clothing away. But, I've also heard it's kind of unhealthy to keep fat wardrobes around "just in case," but whatever, it's a struggle.</TEXT>

I bet the complainers would give anything to be thin and deal with the bit of pain readjusting to a lighter body brings. I've seen participants on shows like "skin tight" (a show about people who lost immense amounts of weight dealing with loose skin and getting it removed) say something like, "the loose skin is almost worse than the fat that use to fill it" in passing, but deep down I doubt they truly mean it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I first started dealing with chronic pain when I was pretty young, around 19/20 so I was in college at the time. Before the pain I was very sociable and wanted to be around people all the time. Afterwards, the pain made it very difficult to much of anything except come to my apartment to hang out and not much else. That made for a very isolated college experience, even as the pain subsided somewhat and I was able to do more because the social damage had been done. The same thing happened when I turned 24 with the pain getting unbearable and the few friends I had dwindled to about 1 or 2 people I could call and maybe get dinner with if I was physically able. I have a hard time talking to people about my life and friends just cannot relate to the idea of a young woman in her prime being unable to do much of anything so making friends is beyond difficult. Especially since I don't/can't do much with my time because of the pain so I have literally nothing interesting to talk about. Health problems make for a very lonely life sometimes.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>[Source](http://www.heraldtribune.com/news/20180423/prom-proposal-draws-accusations-of-racism) Noah Crowley, this upstanding young senior at Riverview High in Sarasota, Florida decided the best way to ask his crush to prom was through a racist slave joke. Lovely! Apparently this school has been having a lot go problems with racial bullying. According to one classmate on [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/mrzswagie/posts/1793828974010516):  gt;Riverview has been recently going through a  #8220;race war #8221; for the past couple of weeks, my best friend and I have been dealing with a girl who has been repeatedly calling us a nigger and an  #8220;uneducated black bitch #8221; which she has openly said she was racist. Resulting in us getting in trouble by administration because they fear we #8217;re going to put our hands on her. One administrator has even told us that  #8220; it #8217;s her right to speak how she wants too #8221;. The boy in the picture has caused disruption besides this one where he threw a banana at a mixed boy and told him to  #8220;go fetch #8221;. And a few white boys have ganged up on a couple of black kids going to snapchat calling them niggers and monkeys. All of which RIVERVIEW STAFF and administration knows about and has done nothing. They #8217;re letting these kids walk freely around expressing racism and told us  #8220;if you touch anyone, we will suspend you and not let you graduate #8221; this is what riverview high school is letting their students do, and basically telling us black kids to deal with it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I also read the ones that are like, "today is the day everything will change" and they go into their life story of being obese since childhood, not knowing what calories are, never having exercise ever... just a lifetime of ignorance and bad habits, which I don't judge, that's life. But then they say how from today on they're only going to eat 1200 calories a day and run every other day for 3 miles and stop drinking anything with calories and only eat clean and they just purged their kitchen of every morsel of junk food and they've sworn off added sugar and blah blah blah. And I'm thinking, "if they're already an adult and spent their entire lives up until now knowing nothing about how to be healthy and having piss-poor habits engrained in them since birth, how can they possibly think they can make *that* many drastic lifestyle changes and keep it up indefinitely. I mean, change is obviously needed to get healthy if you're 350+ pounds, but start small or make one big change at a time. First, stop drinking calories and try to stick to water. Then when that addiction is under control maybe address your penchant for sugar. I also see the purging of junk food from kitchen and diet altogether a death knell for a lifestyle change/diet. Going cold turkey on that kind of stuff can way to constricting for most people, especially those with a food addiction. A lot of those people need so much support and guidance and a lot of them think they can go from super morbidly obese with a diet comprising solely junk food and completely void of fruits and vegetables and just start the next day as a clean-eating, 1200 calorie-counting, exercising bastion of health. It's just a recipe for failure and then the person says to themselves, "See diets don't work for some people. They're just too hard!" and give up altogether.</TEXT>

However, there is no benefit to having a BMI north of 35 that makes it justifiable in the face of the cost of being so heavy. So you're comparing beneficial, healthy exercise with a very small chance of injury (probably not chronic) or being heavy to the detriment of your health with a large chance of developing chronic, debilitating disease that costs a lot more.

    <TEXT> gt; Then I started getting confused. I don't look genderless. Not even close. And if genderlessness is a plus, why aim for hyper femininity? I was perplexed at this, as well. How can you say hyper-femininity is imperative and takes more work when you're fat one second and then the next you bitching about only thin people can be androgynous? First of all, fat tends to hide secondary sex characteristics so if you're gender fluid I imagine the fat would actually help (unless it all goes to your giant boobs, which I admit would be a problem). The only time being genderless would be easier as a "thin" person is if you're *really* thin, like, underweight, and have no fat on your hips or bust as a woman. These people have to perform so much mental gymnastics to see themselves as "oppressed," it's a shame that doesn't burn calories.</TEXT>

I wouldn't say I'm addicted to foods or anything, but I definitely have a sweet-tooth from abstaining for such a long time. And the binges when my blood sugar when I go low are epic. Of course I rebound something fierce and my endo yells at me for over-treating and I'm like, I'm gonna inject you with 10 units of insulin and see how well you resist food!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Count yourself lucky then! When I was a girl scout I wanted soooo badly to joint the boy scouts with my brother. The closest thing we came to outdoorsy/camping was a huge heated lodge with beds in the forest with running water. We didn't even build our own fire for the bonfires we had. We used starter logs and didn't even add real wood to them. Never learned a knot, did archery, read a fucking compass, any of that. I know it's a lot to do with what the leadership wants to/is willing to do so maybe I just got unlucky with some unadventurous leaders, but I never met another girl scout who described anything different than what my troop did. Hell, on one "camping" trip a troop across the stream from our lodge ordered pizza in for dinner. At least we cooked hot dogs over the fire :/ When my dad and brother described their real camping trips, showed me their pocketknives (which were banned from my troop), when I read their guidebooks telling them all this awesome survival shit my mouth would water. Girl Scout jamboree for me was held in a fuckin hotel whereas Boy Scout jamboree was out in the forest in real tents, swimming in a lake, oh man I never wanted to go home after family visiting day.</TEXT>

Because of the nature of my ED I gain weight really fast in the form of fluids in the realm of 3 or 4 pounds a day for maybe 3-5 days before I level out, which is part of the reason I couldn't get myself to stop my behaviors; I was just so scared of that water weight. She didn't pull me aside at a better time and ask maybe why I was gaining weight or maybe ask the doctor why I might be gaining so fast, she had to tell me I had too much food on my tray (I followed the meal plan to a T plus 1/2 an extra protein to help with the water weight) and that I should rethink what I was about to eat because I was gaining too fast. I wanted to abandon ship and start my behaviors again immediately and they had to practically force-feed me lunch. I spent the rest of the day crying.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I tried weed before medical marijuana became legal in my state and it was kind of a disaster, mostly due to my own plebeness. I got my friend who smokes a lot to bring me some weed and I had my own bowl from college so I figured, hey, I could figure out how to pack a bowl myself, right? (my roommate who introduced me to pot always packed the bowls for us and I haven't smoked since I lived with her). So I packed it the way I thought I should have, sparked it up and took a big ol' drag and promptly started coughing up a lung. I was always a cougher, but never *this* bad. I coughed so hard I blacked out for a couple seconds and was 2 seconds from calling an ambulance because I just couldn't get a breath in. Obviously the weed did nothing for my pain this time and I was too afraid to try again to see if it could help and have pretty much abandoned the whole idea. Even if I got a medical marijuana card, which would be pretty easy, the products are just soooo expensive and I couldn't afford it. My pain meds now are like, 10 bucks a month for everything except the Lyrica for my neuropathy so until insurance covers edibles (no coughing) I will not be finding any relief from medical marijuana personally. :( I would LOVE to get off these damned opioids and have a BM more often than once every 3 weeks, that would help with more than just the pain.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Oh most definitely. There's the safe feeling of being "un-rapeable" when you're so big, mostly not a conscious move, but often kind of below the surface, and there's also the "safety" of eating.When you face so much trauma, you have to find a place you feel safe and when a relative in your own home is abusing you, your whole home no longer feels safe, but these victims of abuse can feel safety when they eat. They can numb themselves and shut off the world, just like any addiction to drugs or alcohol. If you watch intervention, something like 75% of the women on the show have been sexually abused and turned to drugs to drown out those feelings and just check out of the world. Even after the abuse stops and the girls become the women we see, that trauma hasn't, and probably won't, go away, anytime soon, at least. So the feeding of the feelings continues to drown out those intrusive thoughts and memories of abuse. Instead of dealing with those feelings directly, with a therapist or otherwise, the women on this show simply numb themselves by bingeing and get up to a half ton. It's really quite tragic, but it also underlines the importance of therapy for Dr. Now's patients since simply *really liking food* isn't piling on 450+ excess pounds. Sometimes there are people no the show that I'm like, what the fuck is wrong with you?!? but whenever a patient has sexual/physical/etc. abuse in their history my heart breaks for them.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, I always figured if I ever did switch to cannabis it would have to be edibles or anything besides smoking. I didn't even know there were capsules. What do they tend to cost and do you have any idea what their strength compared to opioids are? Like, I'd need $x worth of capsules to replace 1 morphine er or whatever. I know that's probably pretty hard to answer since it varies from person to person so much. I use extra-strength stool softeners daily plus colace laxative when it's gotten to the point I cannot focus on anything else except the constipation and pain resulting from it. The laxatives themselves are very... ummm inconvenient and messy to put it lightly so I try to wait it out as long as possible and also to use them as little as possible in the hopes that when I get off opioids I will still have functioning bowels, but that's not likely with because I'd still have diabetic gastroparesis :( But yeah, before this little system I had tried just about everything anyone has ever suggested to me for prolonged periods of time to make sure it wasn't just a delayed reaction kind of treatment and nothing has really done more than what I'm doing right now. Sorry, that was a lot of info you probably didn't need to know about me, haha, it's just I talk to so few people due to the chronic pain making me a homebody, the fact that I get legit anxiety talking to people on the phone, and I have few to no people I can talk about this kind of stuff.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks for the suggestion! I also have diabetic gastroparesis, which causes my gut motility to slow down by a *lot* and the nerves are shot in my bowels and digestive system so they don't tell the body to move things along like they should. So even without the pain meds, I'd still have some uphill battles when it comes to... going. Most times I get advice about this it's something I've tried before, cus I feel like I've tried *everything* already, but I hadn't thought to take over the recommended dose of stool softeners, which I'm kind of imagining is the case if you're taking 6 stool softeners a day. I've been taking one extra-strength stool softener (Docusate sodium 250mg) in the morning, but I hadn't thought about taking more than the recommended amount. What kind do you use? Is it more than what's recommended on the packaging or is it 3, 2xday the suggested dosage?</TEXT>

I was fine with joints though... huh. Anyways, I'd much rather just consume it in a cookie or whatever, but that gets expensive (I think, but I very well could be wrong about that). How do you use CBD oil and how much does it cost? Is there a way to figure out how much of an edible/CBD oil you'd need to replace the meds you're on? Like, half a pot brownie is equivalent to 1 morphine er? I know that makes me seem like I know nothing about cannabis, which is totally true so forgive my ignorance. I could pretty easily get a medical marijuana card because I've had 2 doctors suggest it to me already, I just want to weigh the costs of opioids vs. cannabis.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, I agree with your second part. I've noticed that when the subject of disability comes up there's always someone who's like, "I'm in a wheelchair, but I still play wheelchair basketball and get a good workout" and other comments in that vein and they always end with, "if I can do it, what's their excuse?" referring to FAs. Some disabilities are easier to work exercise into than others. I wouldn't want to be in a wheelchair for sure, but I have sever chronic pain and peripheral edema that make exercise almost impossible. I do 30-60 min of yoga a day, but that's about my limit. Keeping the weight off is also way harder because I have such a low TDEE and there's nothing I can do about it, plus I'm a type 1 diabetic, which makes calorie planning a lot harder at times. I'm not throwing these reasons out as excuses, I still think one can calorie-count to stay in a healthy weight range, but it is truly much more difficult for some people with health issues even if you have different health issues that don't limit you as much.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's also important to have subs like that where people with EDs or are recovering from EDs can go for support that they cannot get elsewhere. I mean, where else could someone who's underweight go to rant that they feel fat after moving their BMI up to 16 from 15 and not get downvoted to hell or get really hateful responses? But when you're in recovery, you need someone you can talk to who knows what it feels like and can commiserate. Obviously you don't want a community where those people would react with "that's because you are getting fat! get back to your behaviors before you blow up like a blimp!" but it doesn't seem to be that kind of sub. It's not so much pro-ED as much as it is pro-ED-sufferer. When I was recovering I remember I was feeling really insecure with the recent weight gain and I couldn't talk to *anyone* about it. I made an off-hand comment once to a friend that I had to buy some new pants because none of my old ones would even zip anymore and I was really down about that and her reaction was something like, "oh please, I wish I needed to buy pants in your size!" in a *really* not nice way. And she was my best friend so I was like, "note to self, never ever talk about your eating disorder outside of therapy," which is so freaking hard and isolating since your ED takes up so much of your mind during and when in recovery.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Are there any other pain centers you can go to? It's ridiculous that in this country you're limited to one through you insurance and they won't even take you as a patient. Perhaps you can call them back and tell them they are your only resource for pain management and have no where else to go, maybe get on a waitlist to be seen? Is there any way to pay out of pocket for a visit to another pain center in order to get a script? Sometimes those places are understanding and will treat you relatively affordably and give you post-dated scripts so that you can keep getting your meds without having to pay out of pocket for visits to get the scripts every month. Is there any way to go to a different PCP who will treat you in the time before you can get into a pain clinic? Sorry about all the questions, these are the only things I can think of that might get you your relief. I've talked to some other people here about medical marijuana and using CBD capsules or candies or edibles etc. that don't get you high, but still treat the pain. Are you in a legal state? That could be an avenue worth trying if you're comfortable with that. I'm not sure if you need a medical marijuana card to order CBD capsules over the internet like it was suggested to me as I haven't approached this kind of treatment yet, but I'm planning on switching from opioids to CBD once I talk to my PCP about it. I know this probably isn't the kind of advice you were here for or maybe even want to hear, but losing weight can help with pain, especially joint paint and back pain like you're having. I'm not saying it would cure it or make it go away completely just by losing weight or exercising, but I've heard many testimonies from people whose chronic pain subsided a little bit, sometimes more, once they reduced their weight into the healthy range. Exercise can also help a lot, but that depends on the person. Hearing the kinds of pain you're in and their source, it doesn't sound like exercise would be very helpful. I personally don't have the kind of pain that exercise helps, in fact, it exacerbates it, even physical therapy. Have you considered PT? Perhaps that's something you can try since exercise on its own doesn't sound like a great idea given your physical issues and doing something physical under the guidance of a trained professional could probably help. Good luck with everything! I hope to you find relief or someone who's willing to help you in a way that will relieve your pain at least to a tolerable level.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Geez maneeze! I guess I'm super lucky in that it wasn't hard to get into a pain clinic; I had to wait a couple months, but at least they took me. And yes, it's insulting when a Dr. tells you that your scoliosis would be *cured* if you lost some weight. It *might* help a little, but to expect it to completely correct itself is absurd. How in the world does that work? Get a little weight off of your body and suddenly your spine straightens up? If weight had that kind of effect on the spine this country would be rampant with scoliosis patients due to the obesity epidemic. Anyway, I haven't yet explored CBP because I'm lucky enough my PCP took control of the pain meds instead of the pain clinic (kind of a weird situation with that actually and a long story), so opioids are like, dirt cheap and moving to CBD would be a huge increase in cost. It might be worth it if some health issues I've been having are side effects of the opioids and I could avoid them with CBP, but I'm not convinced it will. If you have an HMO and they refer you to a place in-network that won't take new patients, then your health insurance has to cover another location that will take you. They can't just be like, "sorry, we'll only pay for this much-needed treatment at this one place and if they won't take you then TFB" I had a similar situation and talked to my PCP and insurance company and had to find another Dr. my brother could go to who wasn't strictly in-network because all the in-network Dr.s couldn't take him. Again, good luck with everything, I hope you find someone who will help you so you won't be in pain once your stash runs out! Let me know how everything goes and if you find someone to help.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I just flew from Chicago to Miami then Miami to Ecuador then from there to the Galapagos and then back and no one batted an eye at my meds. I'm also diabetic so I had syringes and vials of insulin and all the accouterment that goes with it, which is a *lot*. For my extensive prescriptions I had to take with me I used a big pill case with 7 days each with 4 slots so I could take 2 weeks' worth all organized. I also packed another week extra just in case an what I did with those is put them individually in little pill bags I get from the drugstore. They are like 2"x2" little plastic bags that seal. Then I went to my pharmacy and had them print out the labels for all my prescriptions and attached each label to the bag with the accompanying medications. The TSA also has these cards you can print out [here](https://www.tsa.gov/sites/default/files/disability_notification_card_508.pdf) that you can type in whatever disability you have, like chronic pain or if you have a spinal chord stimulator or insulin pump that at least shows why you have all these meds with you. Again, no one batted an eye and almost my entire duffel bag I carried on what filled with medical supplies, but it's best to hav your bases covered just in case.</TEXT>

When my thyroid was untreated, my metabolism legitimately slowed down a little bit, which leads to *minor* weight gain, but you don't feel normal and go about your day as normal while burning ~200-300 calories less per day. You feel tired and shitty *all* the time, you're lethargic, you're not accomplishing the same things throughout your day that you would with a normal thyroid and magically do it on less calories.

In most cases these legally immigrated Latinos came from affluent, safe backgrounds and had no idea the kind of atrocities some people are fleeing when they come in illegally.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In his reasoning for why you should keep quiet he went through the negative consequences for your mom, her siblings, your uncle, his wife and marriage, etc. and said that your happiness/safety doesn't trump all the unhappiness you *may* cause if you tell your mom, but that's totally short-sighted. Yes, some people may have their worlds rocked, but if your uncle goes on to predate on some other family members or perhaps women/children younger than you then the damage will far exceed that of your family in the short-run. Even if he didn't, even if he only wanted to creep on you, the safety and peace of mind of one person (you) doesn't automatically mean less than the happiness of several people (your family) just because more people will be unhappy versus your one. It's kind of like that ethics puzzle of whether it's more ethical to save the life of one person at the cost of many or to save many people at the cost of one. There's no one answer; it's not black or white. The fact that more people will do through discomfort because of the truth doesn't make that the wrong thing to do if the other option is to make only one person go through the emotional turmoil you'd be going through. Also, his family deserves to know what kind of person your uncle is so they can decide whether they want to associate with a creep with ancestral tendencies.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>One *could* argue, though, that fat people endanger the people who inevitably have to care for them when they get hurt or sick. Fat person's home is on fire? Firemen have to somehow transport immobile fat person out of house because they couldn't just get up and run outside like a non-fat person or even a nominally fat person. In the hospital for another heart attack? Nurses have to bathe, turn, lift fat patient to care for them properly, which takes a large physical toll and can cause injuries or worse. I've heard of stories of fat people going down the stairs during a fire so slowly and blocking the passage of anyone around them, which endangers everyone else behind them. The other day I was walking and passed on the side of this *really* big woman and she tripped right as I was next to her, fell, and reached out at my arm and took me down with her. No broken bones or anything more serious than a bruise, but that could have ended pretty bad if it were someone more frail or if she tripped and fell on a child or something. I realize these situations don't happen as often as drunk drivings and these examples aren't nearly as immediately dangerous or life-threatening to those around a fat person, there is a small parallel between the two.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I would never argue that it's easy to lose weight, simple yes, but not easy. All I'm saying is that the core of losing weight is eating less and moving more. How you get to the point that you can do that is another matter altogether. I had no problem with the commenters that said it was hard to lose weight or food addictions make it much more difficult because that's true, but there were some people arguing that it's physically harder fat people to lose weight and maintain it once it is lost not because of bad habits coming back, but just because some people's bodies want them to be fat, which is patently ridiculous. As for the psychological interventions on "My 600 Pound Life" (which I am a huuuuge fan of) I agree that they should be done first and foremost. You don't get to half a ton in weight without some serious psychological problems taking hold. I'm not sure, though, when they start the therapy for the patients. They seem to always send them to someone when they fail, but I've also seen a couple episodes where they were sent to someone right away so I think Dr. Now kind of waits to see who's noncompliant and then makes the recommendation, which I think is a mistake. I think dealing with the mental blocks should be the first step in their weight loss journeys and the rest can follow, but I am no expert.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I try not to feel bad or upset if I offend someone or feel judged because in the end, like you said, we're all just strangers, but it's so hard. A while ago I asked a women, very politely and stressed that I wasn't being judgment of her situation, why she was breastfeeding her 5-year-old, which she mentioned in the comment I replied to and she replied that she did think I was being judgmental because of how I phrased the question (I asked "why do you breastfeed your 5-year-old?" instead of "why does your 5-year-old breastfeed?") and it *really* bothered me. I even replied back why I had phrased it that way (I was simply mirroring how she phrased her original comment) and was kinda snarky/sarcastic at the very end and the next day I had like, 5 more messages. I avoided reading them for over a week. I literally couldn't face it if she responded back in a nasty way or got into an argument or, god forbid, more redditers wanted to berate me for what I said. Anyway, sorry about that long-winded way of saying I suck at letting things roll off my back no matter who it is who says it to me. Which his why almost all of my comments are within /r/fatlogic where I feel fairly safe I won't get yelled at.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've only heard this from a handful of people, but the worst case was my college roommate. I was dealing with a pretty dangerous/nasty eating disorder and had confided in her once or twice so she definitely knew what was going on. We were in the dining hall eating dinner and I had a pretty large dinner, but I was cycling through periods of anorexia and bulimia so it's not like it any large amount of food was going to stay in my stomach very long, yet she still said to me, "You're so lucky you can eat like that and stay so skinny. I wish I could do that." And I was just shocked, but couldn't confront how insulting/stupid that statement was because there were other people at the table who didn't know about my ED situation. But there was no moment of realization after she said, no apologies or even recognition that what she said was so incredibly hurtful. I mean, if she wanted to protect my secret I guess she wouldn't say, "oh, wait, I forgot you've got an ED. Nevermind!" or anything like that, but I could tell by her face there was no moment of clarity.</TEXT>

I asked her what was wrong with sucralose and she responded, "I don't trust all that unnatural shit and I read it causes cancer" as she cracked open a can of regular coke chock-full of high-fructose corn syrup." I didn't even try to correct her knowing it was a lost cause.</TEXT>

I totally understand being cognizant that artificial sweeteners do have a few calories, but like you said, you need to use very little that even if you sweetened something to high heaven you probably tapped out at like, 20 calories. Again, good to realize you're adding a *small* amount of calories if your calorie-counting and want to be as diligent as possible, but hardly a scam in my book.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If you read "loads of Shakespeare plays and sonnets" in only most of one Saturday you probably didn't take enough time to actually understand and analyze it. The reason they're so highly considered is because they're not some trash novel you can speed-read through in a couple hours. But that's just the opinion of some Shakespeare-appreciating simpleton.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Right, my point exactly. Like, if all you do is speed-read through his works and get the gist of the plot, then I would wager that you didn't quite appreciate it to its fullest extent or understand the nuances or read between the lines.

I would contend that he cannot truly judge a piece of work based solely on an afternoon of speed-reading through "loads" of his plays and sonnets. He may have gotten the plot and laughed at the humor and understood the tragedy when appropriate, but if you read through them that fast I highly doubt he's in the position to say it's not complex or nothing special because he couldn't possibly have appreciated all the nuances and everything there is to read between the lines while reading through it at that speed in my opinion.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm no lit major, but I always loved my comp lit classes in college and took on Grimm's Fairy Tales in historical context and we spent a week on one or maybe two *fairy tales* in order to truly appreciate all the nuances and everything else going on between the lines. The last time I "studied" Shakespeare would have been high school AP English and even then it took a while for me to discern the plot from the way it was written, but some people could read through a lot faster and get the gist of what was going on, so I guess I don't exactly doubt he could speed-read and *understand* the basic plot, but there's a hell of a lot more to Shakespeare than the plot so if this guy thinks he can get everything there is going on in "loads" of *Shakespeare's* sonnets and plays in most a single day *and* deem them inferior he's definitely got some iamverysmart going on.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not to start any kind of hostility, honestly, just letting you know that this is the kind of rhetoric that turns people off of vegans and explains the downvotes. If you want to go vegan for moral/anti-cruelty reasons then more power to you. I admire that dedication, I really do, especially since I personally do not have the will power to fully give up animal products. But, when you guilt trip/shame non-vegans for not making the same choices as you, vegans get a bag name. You know all those sayings like, "how do you know someone's a vegan? don't worry, they'll always let you know" or when people talk about sanctimonious vegans? They're probably referring to vegans like you and other non-judgmental vegans get lumped in with them. ETA: while you go vegan to be "cruelty-free" there's plenty of cruelty involved in the people who provide you quinoa and produce if it's not local. It's virtually impossible to eat 100% cruelty free in the developed world short of living on a small farm and growing literally everything you eat, which if you do, then awesome. But if you cannot be 100% sure there was no cruelty towards pests or people in the production of your food, maybe save the judgment.</TEXT>

I hate so much that I have to frame my entire life around whether or not I can get my meds. If I wanted/needed to move somewhere new I would have to find a doc within 30 days max of moving who's willing to subscribe my meds, which is no small feat. I have friends who would propose spontaneous trips or whatever and I had to first think, do I have enough meds for that?

But if I went through every tinder profile I'd bet profiles with height requirements are in a small minority in real life.

And whenever a woman gets in trouble for something like rape or lying about it they not only bash that one woman, but extend it to all women, especially feminists. They always cite that one tweet by a nut job and use that as a summation of all feminists even though that one crazy man-hater who thinks women should be allowed to rape men because of the suffering they've experienced at the hands of mysogynists (that's a real tweet, unfortunately). If anyone tried to extend that logic the opposite way, however, no one jumps on that bandwagon and you get a whole bunch of "not all menz!"</TEXT>

Not the stomach pains, but about the time I turned 20 I started experiencing debilitating chronic pain that was somewhat helped with some meds and I lived kind of normally for a couple years, then around when I turned 24 I was hit with such awful chronic pain I was practically bed bound, wasted away to nothing, had no will to live, weighed the pros and cons of suicide, the only thing that kept the con list longer was the effect it would have had on my parents to whom I refused to cause any more grief, but they were the only thing keeping me alive. Then I had a little breakthrough with a medication and a surgical procedure that gave me some hope and it was such a relief. I'm still disabled from the pain and limited in many ways, but it's at least remitted enough that I'm not talking myself out of suicide every night. I hope things get much better for you and that the evil gluten is indeed the culprit!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, I never vacation. The only reason I went on this was because some circumstances in my family changed and we finally had the opportunity to travel for the first time in decades. I can't travel on my own, either, so I was kind of just along for the ride for this special trip my parents picked out. I was crazy worried before we went that I wouldn't be able to take the activity on the trip, which was a week-long cruise to the Galapagos Islands off of Ecuador and involved 3 activities per day such as snorkeling, to boat rides, and hiking ranging from easy to pretty intense. Each hike was definitely an effort for me, but they weren't too long so I survived. I skipped the really labor-intensive ones, though, and just went for a boat ride. I was so surprised and relieved I was able to enjoy and keep up with everyone on the trip, although I definitely burned through all my breakthrough pain meds and was hurting something fierce by the end of the day, but I made it and that's what counts. I hope you somehow resolve this fiasco! Doctors can be so narrow-minded sometimes about what's proper treatment and what should be expected of patients, especially pain patients. What meds are you going to be short on, if you don't mind my asking? (Sorry to only respond days later)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I can see having little sympathy for drug addicts who have the resources and support to fix their habit, but some people especially the homeless, have little recourse. They're only mode of quitting is cold-turkey since they have no access to rehab, no family to fall back on, hell, they're homeless they obviously don't have a lot of anything. If they refuse to go back home because that means they'd have to get clean, then yes, little sympathy. But most people are homeless because of things out of their control or don't have the opportunities to build a better life. It's also tough on the streets, I've read that a lot of homeless are addicted to drugs or alcohol because it's so depressing to be homeless that they have to numb themselves in order to just get through the day. I realize your example is only one instance of a drug addict, but I have a little more sympathy for those on the streets, I guess. But, people who have family begging them to go to rehab they'd pay for piss me the fuck off. People who chose drugs over a life, family, love, etc. get me pretty angry. My own brother was a drug addict, but because he was addicted to prescription meds, it "wasn't a problem because a doctor prescribed them" according to him (and my parents for a while). It eventually killed him, intentionally or inadvertently, we're not sure, but it did cause his death in the end. He had all the opportunities in the world to get clean, but always chose to get high instead. I get angry at those kinds of people. The people on the show "Intervention" who constantly chose drugs over a life.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't agree with the message in the picture of this post, but I have to say, that as a type 1 diabetic hearing "diabetes on a plate" or "cup of diabetes" when referring to fattening/sugary foods does get on my nerves a bit. Not enough to tweet about it or demand people stop saying it, but it is quite annoying to myself and other type 1s I'm friends with. Mostly because theres no differentiating between the two types when someone says diabetes and the two have entirely different causes. Well, the cause of type 1 is unknown whereas type 2 is genetically predisposed, but in *most cases* caused by poor lifestyles. It just gets old when you're so often conflated with people who basically caused their own disease whereas I'm stuck my mine and do my damnedest to take care of it the best I can and would *kill* to be able to cure it just by watching my diet and getting off my fats once in a while.

    <TEXT>I also love how "regular size" only means size 0 in her little brain. Like, yes, not everyone should strive to be size 0 because few women are a healthy weight at that point. However, plus size only starts at size 10 at the smallest while a lot of people think it starts at 12 or 14. Yes, some women are perfectly healthy at size 10, but only the super tall. The average-height woman should really be able to fit into regular size clothes, barring the few exceptions.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ugh, well put, unfortunately. I hate the whole "pussy pass denied" card a lot of men pull out whenever a woman is punished. Like, yes, there are some things women get away with just because they're women, but the same goes for men. But when men get away with shit, like, I dunno, grabbing a woman by the pussy, it's seen as "just the way it is," but when a woman gets a pass all hell breaks loose. I's also like to add that when women get away with shit because of their tits or good looks, it's almost entirely because a man can't think with his big head and lets her go. It's not some female conspiracy we all got together to plot to get away with shit. No, it's because some guy wanted to get laid or falls for a woman's charm and lets her go, thus perpetuating the "pussy pass."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My chronic pain is a combination of fibromyalgia and diabetic neuropathy that seemed to have resulted from/was triggered by poor control of my diabetes suddenly being controlled. It's kind of a combination of it being a result of a disease and an accident that caused it. When I was a senior in high school I developed an eating disorder that started out as your garden variety anorexia and developed in one that involved restricting my insulin so that I was high/in diabetic ketoacidosis all the time, which resulted in rapid weight loss without limiting food. Any diabetic and many people in general know that this is incredibly dangerous for your health. After about a year of this my parents finally got me into treatment and I went from sky high all the time to perfect numbers, which is great. For some reason it triggered awful chronic pain that was eventually controlled with meds to the point I could continue college with disability benefits to help me get through it physically. I relapsed near the end of college and this continued for years before I finally had a wake-up call that stuck and without treatment I brought my numbers down to an acceptable level from even higher numbers than my first go around. This triggered even worse chronic pain than before to the point I had to move home and was almost bed bound from the pain. Since then I've had my numbers under pretty constant control so that pain has more or less leveled off and is controlled through meds, although they are a lot more aggressive than the ones I used to treat it the first time around.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There was a show on an American tv station called TLC, which is notorious for trashy "reality" shows, that was about a tropical vacation resort solely for fat people. I can't for the life of me find anything online about it or what it was called; I think it was just a one-off episode. Anyway they of course interview the vacationers beforehand and they all went on about how they're always judged everywhere they go. People are always calling them names and always thinking these awful things about them that they're "forced to become recluses" (they actually used that phrase). A lot of them weren't even *that* huge compared to the regular growing population in the first place. Very few of them would even warrant a second glance, but of course they're forced to become recluses because of these thoughts they put into other people's heads. On the other hand, one person said they hate being such a "spectacle" and I can totally understand that. On one hand, they shouldn't be mocked or made *into* a spectacle, but on the other hand, shouldn't people who are 300+ pounds be so uncommon that they would be a sort of spectacle? Shouldn't the death fats or super-morbidly obese not be the norm. It's so sad that we're getting so big as a population that someone who would be the "world's fattest man" at a so-called freak show in the past wouldn't even get a second glance now?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Fair point. Few women are a *true* size 0 at a healthy weight, but given vanity sizes I suppose that might be less accurate. Although, I'm 5'0" and when I was about 96 pounds I was a 00 in most brands and I was pretty tiny. I wouldn't imagine a 0 being a whole lot bigger so the average woman, which is actually 5'4", would have to be pretty slim to fit into a 0. Still, I get your point.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I believe it is referred to as "purple prose" and it drives me nuts, too. Like, I get when you want to be descriptive and paint a picture, but when you go so far overboard it takes away from what you're actually saying quite a bit. For someone bitching so much about lack of courtesy she sure as shit doesn't show any. She's a size 28, she knows exactly how big she is and that she will not comfortably fit into one seat. If she were like, an 18 or 20 then yeah, there's some wiggle room, but a size 28 isn't fitting into one seat by any stretch of the imagination. So, knowing this, just book an extra seat. It's my understanding that most airlines even reimburse you for it so why the hell wouldn't you do that ahead of time and avoid this situation that is so agonizing for you? I also love how she complained about how the man put the armrest down to "claim it as his own" and like, yeah, his seat is his. The armrest, maybe not, but I doubt that's why he put it down. He probably did that because he knew she'd be spilling into *his* seat if he didn't.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's interesting that you say that. I'm a diabetic with fibromyalgia, too, and the initial onset was precipitated when I got under really tight control after being way out of control for a prolonged period of time. This has happened twice with me with results the same; it was even worse after the time I got under control again after being out of control for an even longer period of time in the first place. After being under control for a while the pain slowly subsided to the point that meds are enough to make life livable and hopefully I won't backslide again; I think I learned my lesson good for now. Since getting into the zone of acceptable A1Cs I haven't noticed any difference in pain when I'm in the same 3 or so point range, but it's interesting that is what happens with you. What kind of range are in that pain change is noticeable?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's exactly what happened with me, initially. The first time around I was immediately hit with several complications due to diabetes that I didn't have when my a1c was acceptable. But all of a sudden when my a16 got to about 8 my retinas were *hemorrhaging* blood due to diabetic retinopathy, diabetic neuropathy hit me along with the fibro, my gastroparesis started, and I had really bad edema in my legs that never went away. The second time I went off the rails with my diabetes my a1c was a bit higher than 14.2 (something I'm very ashamed of) and it was like the pain from the first time around was almost halved and the edema disappeared, although that was probably because I was being ever freaking 20 minutes from being out of control. I was working on my feet 8 hours a day, going out, albeit I still stayed home a lot more than my peers because I still had some edema from being active during work and just being tired and in pain in general, but not nearly as bad as when I was in control. After I got back into control the second time the pain was 3 or 4 times worse. I was almost bed bound from the pain. I'd lay in bed trying to sleep at night then lay in my parents' bed during the day watching tv trying to distract myself from the pain. My digestive system is all kinds of fucked now, too. Luckily, with 6+ painful paper surgeries in each eye the bleeding has stopped so I don't have floaters anymore. What type are you? I'd kill for a 6 or below a1c. I'm at 6.9 right now after finally getting a CGM that's helped immensely and I'm still working on getting even lower, but 4.5 is a pipe dream.</TEXT>

But I would say that women tend to see themselves as fatter than they are and men see themselves as skinnier, as in not muscular, than they are. So, women lose too much weight and men tend to go the opposite direction into illegal hormones and supplements are even injecting synthol into their bodies. If you google "synthol" you'll see picture of men who would be disfigured to most people, but to themselves it's what they should look like or what they think is ideal.</TEXT>

They didn't even mention vegans, just vegetarians in their comment and this vegan just had to shoehorn the fact she was vegan and better than vegetarians into her comment. The someone else mentioned they were 90% vegetarian and her tastes hadn't changed as a result and this same vegan was blaming all her dietary problems on that remaining 10% and just being the stereotypical holier than thou vegan.

They can't be bothered to read to their kids or teach them to be kind to others, that's the teachers' job. Do you get the same attitude from anti-vaxxers? Like, I won't vaccinate my children against harmful and totally preventable diseases, but it's your job to fix it every time shit hits the fan and they get sick? I hate that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm the same way. I'm a type 1 diabetic so a low carb diet would actually make keeping my blood sugars even a lot easier, but I just can't do low carb, let alone keto. I've tried several times. I know most people get satiated faster on fats and protein, but I just happen to be the kind of person who can eat all the protein and fat I want and still be hungry. It just doesn't satisfy me. I've lost much more weight just counting calories than limiting carbs while counting calories. It's not like I suddenly could't count calories while doing low carb, but was successful when I stopped worrying about them. I know I'm in the minority, but still, blanket statements like "you can't/shouldn't eat carbs if you want to lose weight" is ridiculous.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The guilt I felt the most strongest when I first was struggling with chronic pain and feel now, but a little less, is depending almost entirely on my parents as an adult. I was 18 when the fibro and neuropathy first started and then got so bad at age 24 that I had to move back in with my parents and brother, who's also ridden with heart issues that make him dependent upon my parents. So in their retirement years, when they should be enjoying each other's company and traveling and doing everything they couldn't while we were kids, they're still taking care of their kids. This kind of guilt, coupled with the debilitating pain, led me to suicidal ideations, but the only thing that would make me guiltier is doing something that would devastate them as much as my suicide would. So I accepted my limitations and did what little I could to help out. I talked to them about it a lot so that they would reassure me that they love me and they're happy to be able to help me. It didn't do anything the assuage the guilt at first, but as time's gone by (I'm 30 now) and the pain has lessened due to finding the right medication regimen, I've been able to help out more, engage more, and become more independent, although I still live with them, which has helped lessen the feelings of guilt enough that I no longer fear they hate me or wish I could just die or whatever crazy thoughts I had when it first started. I would advise you to talk to you parents and let them know you're aware of how much help they have to give you that no one had predicted, that you realize no parent *has* to support their adult children as much as they may have to support you, but they chose to anyway, and how much you appreciate it all. They'll most likely appreciate the sentiment and have a conversation that shows you're not quite the burden you see yourself as. I saw myself as nothing but a burden and as a previously very independent person, this killed me inside. So hearing from my parents that I'm not a burden and they're here for me because they love me, not because they feel like they have to or they're "stuck" with me, helped start the road to healing emotionally and accepting where I was and that I wasn't a drain on my parents.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have type 1 diabetes and often go low right before bed. So I'd meet my calorie goal for the day then have this unexpected extra 60-120+ calories to account for. Sometimes I'd roll those calories over into the next day and cut out a snack that day or get a smaller portion during a meal, depending on how close I was to my goal on the day I went low. I would only suggest doing this if it's a small number of calories that won't make you feel deprived the next day, like under 200 or so. If you do it with larger amounts then the next day you borrowed from you'd probably feel pretty miserable or maybe not have much energy, but really it depends on how well you manage certain amounts of calories or how big or small your deficit is.</TEXT>

I use to be that weight for a while and because of a med change my appetite was in overload and I creeped a lot higher than I'd like to be. I'm working my way back down, but it's sooooo slow and even one screwup that undo a whole week's worth of work.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>How does he think weight loss surgery works, exactly? I know that with some forms of surgery they bypass some parts of the digestive system so that you absorb slightly less calories, but the bulk of its effectiveness comes from making the stomach physically smaller so that you eat less. If eating less and exercise doesn't help with weight loss, than how does surgery to help you eat less help you lose weight? Bonkers.</TEXT>

I cannot exercise other than an hour of yoga once a week, which frankly isn't exercise, but I've been consistently losing weight by staying under my TDEE. I don't comfort eat, however, which I realize is a limiting factor, but if losing weight is a priority then just counting calories will take many more pounds off than just exercising.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The problem with the statement "studies show that switching to calorie free soda has no effect on weight loss" is that those studies are flawed or don't include the proper parameters to test whether it has an effect. The problem with the average overweight person switching to diet sodas is that they replace those calories they would have been drinking with an equal amount of or more calories than they were drinking in their regular sodas. They think, "I'm getting a diet coke instead of my usual regular, I might as well get the large fries then." If they had ordered a diet coke instead of regular and stayed with eating their usual small fries, then that would result in a calorie deficit compared to their usual calorie intake and weight loss if done consistently. Another problem that might arise is that people aren't cognizant to their hunger cues and sugar cravings. Some diet sodas may create a sugar-craving in some people that results in them wanting something sweet, with actual sugar in it, after having a diet soda. If people count their calories and stay within their usual calorie limits minus their usual regular sodas, they will absolutely lose weight if they replace regular with diet. If a study simply said: Switch to diet sodas and we'll weight you before you do and 1 month after and see if you lose weight, then they'll probably show the results you're citing. Because people will change other behaviors that negate the weight loss that switching to diet sodas would have. Switching to calorie-free sodas will always lead to weight loss if you change absolutely nothing about your diet except exchanging regular soda for diet.</TEXT>

Even at a healthy weight and being a really short woman (5'0") it is always possible to eat less. Who cannot "diet?" Really, it's life-style change, but that's just semantics. Anyone who's eating enough to be fat, overweight, obese, etc. can eat less and eat less calorically dense food in order to lose weight. I'm almost entirely sedentary, yet I still have a TDEE high enough to cut calories and lose weight. No one gains on 1200 calories. These FAs are just so full of shit.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You sound a lot like me when I finally got put on Abilify for my depression (not bipolar). I was miserable and had suicidal ideations before I broke down and went to a psychiatrist who put me on that medication. I suddenly wanted to see friends again, started making friends, stopped avoiding people in general. Bipolar isn't just a fog lifting like it sounds like with you, as I understand. It's more cyclical with downs alongside the ups, so if you're not having depressive episodes along with manic episodes (and you don't sound manic to me), then I would disregard what she's telling you. My brother was bipolar and he wasn't just happy all of a sudden and stayed that way. He'd have manic episodes, which weren't just happy, they were, well... manic. He'd be awake for like, 48-72 hours straight and deep-clean his room or make a whole bunch of lego sets or something really high energy. Then he'd be sleeping for days at a time, really down, go back to his drug habits. It just sounds like you're breaking out of your depression and you physical health has helped with that a lot, which is great. I hope things keep going up at least) for you (well, not the scale ;) at least)!</TEXT>

So after a week of throwing up everything, but no other symptoms, I went to the ER and told them I had a UTI and they tested my piss, which showed nothing because of the aforementioned antibiotics, so they sent me home. Symptoms persisted another week. I was finally admitted to he hospital and they tried all these treatments for the vomiting until they decided to test my *blood* for the UTI and realized I was right all along. I'm kind of prone to UTIs so whenever I get them now I have to fight tooth-and-nail to get treated properly and not have to put up with the vomiting for weeks until they just test my goddamn blood.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>When I was 16 I gained about 20 pounds over maybe 3 or 4 months, which was a lot since I was only 5'0" at the time and hadn't grown at all (still haven't at 30 years old). I decided to go on Weight Watchers and started losing weight and this one friend was instantly threatened. She was telling me I didn't need to lose weight (I weighed almost 140 pounds and looked every bit of it). She constantly tried to derail my weight-loss efforts like suggesting we go to this one restaurant that was my kryptonite at the time every single time we got together and if I tried to measure or limit my food she'd always tell me "to live a little" or "take a break once in a while!" It wasn't until later that I realized I was her "fat friend" that made her feel better about herself, even though she was a perfectly healthy weight, and if I got skinner then *she'd* be the "fat friend," but in reality she'd only be the less-skinny friend. I've heard lots of stories on fat rant tuesday/fridays of people being abandoned by their fat friends for similar reasons. Like, the friends don't want them to look better than they do, they want to stay fat together for a source of comfort, they no longer have their bingeing partner, or they're a reminder that the friend is perfectly capable of losing weight themselves, but they aren't doing it and they have no one to blame except themselves. Looking back at 16 year old me it doesn't shock me that a girl that age would feel that way and react how my friend did, but the idea that fully grown women in their 30s or 40s and beyond act this way and ghost their friends because they lost weight is pathetic.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The rate of mortality for people who undergo bariatric surgery is actually lower than most other routine surgery: Data involving nearly 60,000 bariatric patients from ASMBS Bariatric Centers of Excellence database show that the risk of death within the 30 days following bariatric surgery averages 0.13 percent, or approximately one out of 1,000 patients. This rate is considerably less than most other operations, including gallbladder and hip replacement surgery. Therefore, in spite of the poor health status of bariatric patients prior to surgery, the chance of dying from the operation is exceptionally low. [Source](https://asmbs.org/patients/bariatric-surgery-misconceptions) which may be slightly biased since it's coming from the American Society of Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery, but the statistics I looked up for the surgeries mentioned had higher rates of mortality compared to those for WLS, so I believe what they said is correct.</TEXT>

So, the retreat itself is paid for, but they're still out of pocket to get there and back, which can be pretty prohibitive for many women who aren't Utah local. I also read the therapy isn't even required, it's just an option, but I don't know what conclusion I would draw from that. If it's a retreat for sexual abuse, you'd think therapy would be at the core of the whole thing, but if you don't want therapy I see no use in forcing it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm also 5' nuttin' and what works best for me is intermittent fasting. I've found that when you have such a low TDEE and thus a tiny deficit to work with, it can be hard to spread out the day's calories into 3 solid meals. I like to one-meal-a-day, but I change that up with a 6 hour eating window where I'll have one moderate-large (large for me, small for some) meal and then a big snack later on in the day. IF is not for everyone and OMAD is *definitely* not for everyone, but I like it because I like kind of high-calorie meals and it's so disheartening for me to get such a small portion if I make it 1/3 of my calories for the day. I tend to eat the first big meal pretty soon after getting up, but sometimes I'll wait 5-6 hours depending on my work/sleep schedule for the day, then a snack if I have the room 5-6 hours later.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I had a similar realization regarding the things fat people disqualify themselves for that are a real shame. I recently went to the Galapagos and it hit me at one moment that really big people wouldn't be able to enjoy this gorgeous, pristine environment and that's a real shame. Because it's so pristine, the Galapagos have really strict rules on who/what can visit, so no huge cruise ships with suites and big bathrooms you can pay out the nose for. Just tiny rooms with tiny beds and a tiny bathroom, about the size you described. And forget about actually going on tours of the islands that involve a ton of walking and a lot of it on unstable ground. I mean I'm sure there are some fat people who can handle a hike, but your out-of-shape, average fat person would miss out on so much natural beauty. And the Galapagos isn't the only place fat people miss out on. Fat people can easily get a couple airline seats and stay in a big city like Paris, but places like the top of Machu Pichu where you have to hike to the top are pretty much out of the question. I'm not well-traveled so I'm sure there are other places, but it's like they disable themselves. I'm disabled myself so there are some trips that are out of the question (it was a miracle I made it through the Galapagos) and I'd kill to be able to see those places and fat people are just willfully taken themselves out of the game.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, sometimes people make the comment that people with BED or just obese people in general often don't have much going on in their lives and food is one of the best parts of their days and that's sad/pathetic/sick/whatever. I've got lotsa super fun health issues and am disabled. I don't have much going on in my life as a result and also as a result food is one of the biggest sources of happiness for me right now. I love Friday nights because that means Portillo's cheeseburger and cheese fries. When my mom says she's going to make spaghetti carbonara the next day for dinner I get so excited and sometimes I get that giddy feeling before I go to sleep anticipating that meal (I even had a dream the night before she made it that instead of spaghetti carbonara she made some weird ramen and soy sauce meal and called it roti). I guess that's all just a long-winded way to say I love food and it's the height of joy at this point in my life, but I'm right smack dab in the middle of the healthy range for my height and am consistently losing on top of that. I don't think it's pathetic or disordered like a lot of people here say it is. You can love food and get genuine joy out of it, even have it be the highlight of your day, and still be healthy and have a healthy relationship with food.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Agreed. Even the idea that emotional eating is disordered is not so cut-and-dry, in my opinion. If you're really sad over something and there happens to be a food, like Ben and Jerry's, that helps bring you out of a funk and you can eat it without bingeing or overdoing or just fitting it into your food plan, then I see no problem with that behavior. If it becomes a pattern where you're literally eating at the sign of an emotion, negative or positive, or you emotional binge-eat, then yeah, that's a problem. But self-care in the form of treating yourself when you're down with food occasionally and responsibly is not a bad thing, but that's just me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Methinks they might be mixing concentration camp diet with the Minnesota Starvation Experiment diet. I'm sure people in concentration camps were being fed measly portions, I've read many books that supports that notion. But, the men in the MSE were fed a relatively hefty diet for an experiment predicated on starvation. There are also different stages consisting of different caloric intakes. 1. Control: about 3200 calories to *establish a baseline* as in, this is supposed to be the calories they'd require to maintain their pre-experiment weight. (12 weeks) 2. Semi-starvation, about 1560 calories. This was supposed to emulate how much people were eating at the end of WWII (24 weeks) 3. Restricted rehab diet. The men received one of several diet meant to nourish (ugh) their starving bodies and help them rehabilitate to pre-experiment weight (12 weeks) 4. Unrestricted rehab. A free-for-all. (8 weeks) So less than half of the experiment was even a restricted diet and that was restricted to only 1560 calories, which many FAs would decry as proof that eating less than 2000 calories is "starvation" forgetting that these were full-grown men who were working part-time and also required to walk 22 miles per week, so a lot more active than Brenda in HR. This is just a long-winded explanation as to their inane and insane contention that the bone-thin, skeletal victims of concentration camps were somehow losing that much weight on more than 2000 calories. Granted, a lot of them were doing hard labor, but still, the Nazis weren't that generous across the board to offer that plentiful of food to their captives.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The implication coming from the FA. I think the consensus here is more that worrying about eating too much at that age in *necessarily* a bad thing. It certainly could be, but if the girl is getting chubby and unhappy with how she feels or looks and wants to take control, I wouldn't raise the alarms just yet.</TEXT>
