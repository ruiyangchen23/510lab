My build in this video is primarily a 2h spectral thrower with tons of life steal, rarity and quantity stacked in the gear. I used the WoE because it's a 2h that counts as dual wielding, so I grabbed a bunch of dual wielding nodes too for extra damage. But everyone saying it's bad is just looking at the situation wrong! Don't think of it as face diving a 66 map with 1.7k life just to die! The way I see it, this build was one hit away from clearing a 66 map with 1.7k life :3</TEXT>

    <TITLE>TIFU using the child's toilet in a family washroom</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-02-07 09:25:21</DATE>
    <TEXT>Alright! So I work in a mall and I only have access to public washrooms. There's your typical Male, Female and a Family washroom. Everyone at work loves to use the Family washroom over the normal washrooms because you're able to lock the door and have some real privacy. In this Family washroom, there are two toilets. One normal adult sized toilet, and one slightly smaller, MUCH shorter toilet about 5 feet away which was obviously intended for toddlers. The lid of this toddler toilet was about 6 inches off the ground. Very short. Also, there is only one toilet paper roll and it's mounted to the wall beside the adult toilet. Some coworkers and I were browsing Reddit one morning and we stumbled upon some miracle invention called the [Squatty Potty](http://www.squattypotty.com/media/static/styles/images/testimonial-banner.jpg). Apparently it's healthier and easier to poop when your legs are elevated into a squatting position. None of us had ever experienced pooping like that, so we were all very curious about it. I recalled the shorter toilet in the Family washroom. Surely it would be identical to using a Squatty Potty! It's low to the ground so you'd be pooping in a squatting position. I decided that I was going to be the guinea pig hero our kiosk deserved and test it out. If all went well and this whole squat pooping thing wasn't just hype, we might never be using the normal toilet again! So I finish drinking my coffee and before I know it... It hits me like a wall. "It's time." I casually make my way to the Family washroom. I feel anxious. I know what I'm about to do is pretty messed up. I look at the door... It's vacant. So I enter the room and close the door behind me while sizing up the child's toilet I'm about to desecrate. I already feel ashamed. But it's for the greater good. Now I'm no germophobe, but if you don't mummify a public toilet seat, you are a savage in my eyes! I maybe about to poop in a child's toilet, but I am no savage. I start to coat the seat in a layer of toilet paper. Once it's completely covered, I grab handfuls of toilet paper so I can wipe after the deed is done. I take a deep breath drop my pants and begin to fulfill my destiny. I immediately regret my decision. Right away I notice big problem number one: Stability is nearly impossible! I had my pants around my ankles, leaving little to no slack for my legs to move around for balance. You either remove the pants so you can spread your legs out for stability or you suck it up and sit there crouched like a [gargoyle using your hands for stability](http://shadowsart.weebly.com/uploads/1/0/3/4/10346870/9594675_orig.jpg) on the disgusting bathroom floor. I'm sure as hell not removing my pants, so I wiggled my pants back up to my knees so I could spread my feet as much as possible and while still maintaining my gargoyle position, I release the beast. Immediately, I encounter big problem number two: The bowl is simply not deep enough for a grown man's full load. Being only 6 inches or so off the ground, there's not a lot of room for depth in this toilet. My log hits the bottom of the bowl and begins to push up towards me. This feels wrong. Like I'm on a poopdraulic lift that's not going anywhere. Then big problem number three: Half of my poop is not submerged and I'm closer to it than ever. The smell is unholy and overpowering. I had to pinch the loaf to divide the load so it would all submerge and the smell would dissipate. Then I hear voices in the hall. Children accompanied by an adult male. A family. "NO." I have a mini-heart attack as I realize that I can't remember if I threw the deadbolt or not. I must have. I'm not THAT careless. At this point, I'm like 70% sure that I am safe and about 30% sure that I'm about to have a parent and their kids thrust the door open. I start to imagine the worst.. What would they see when they enter? A grown man defiling a toddler's toilet in the position of a perched gargoyle. Oh god! They would surely point and laugh, call people over, someone would inform security while others would take pictures and make me their snapchat story. I begin to wipe vigorously. I'm done. Get me the fuck out of here. A bang on the door snaps me out of my daydream. They're here. I brace for the worst. I can hear the handle wiggle as someone grabs it, it turns... and the door moves in about half a centimeter before the deadbolt stops it. YES! THANK GOD! I release a terrified sigh. "Someone's in there." Says one of the children. "No fucking shit." I whisper under my breath. Now I have to drag this whole process out because I can't bear to look into the eyes of that family I denied. Because of my aggressive wiping, I did not properly ration my toilet paper and I am now out of it... But the job is not done. This is definitely not a No-Stress-No-Mess poop, you know. I have to somehow make my way from where I am, about 7 feet across the bathroom to the dispenser. I muster all my strength into my aching legs, perform the squat from hell and get myself up into a hunched position so I can shuffle across the bathroom looking like [Quasimodo](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/db/Hunchback_-Notre_Dame_1923.jpg). I empty that damn roll. There's no way I'm going to be able to perform that maneuver again. Now I know what you're thinking. You're hoping I just used the adult toilet from that point, since it was available and RIGHT there. No. No, I am a man who finishes what he starts. I got back on that miniature throne and finished the miserable job. It barely flushed. I washed my hands, while staring at myself in the mirror and silently questioning my morals. TL;DR, Thought a toddler toilet was an adequate comparison to a Squatty Potty and had the single most stressful pooping experience of my life.</TEXT>

It's also often something only I can do, so it feels special when I do it in front of people. It's never uncomfortably high up though.. Usually just over the top of fences, houses, trees or street lights. It's always the same little process of making it happen too, it's just a deep breath held in and pushed and it happens.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Most sim cards will have the carrier's logo on them. If not, pop the sim card into your own phone and as long as it is still active and doesn't conflict with your carrier settings, you should be able to see what carrier it's from. You would also obtain the phone number this way. When the sim card is in your phone, open your contacts and the number should be at the top. Alternatively the phone number can also be found in the settings.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Just saw them Tuesday night and I gotta say.. If you have the opportunity to see them and are hesitating even a little, JUST GO. You could tell that every member put everything they had into their performance. Eric extending his guitar to the mob to let them go wild. Connor nails every note and seemed to put so much effort into his screams that he literally sent his entire body into tremors. Ricky doing nasty wild shit on his pedalboard, I don't even know what he was doing but it was hectic and sounded sick. This band is passion incarnate. Super nice dudes too. Get on it!</TEXT>

Of course if you can think of a question you actually want to know the answer to, ask that. Fair warning though, they don't like to talk about what song/lyrics are about. So have a backup question if you are headed down that road. 1. If you could have anyone alive or dead as a dinner guest, who would it be? 2. What's something on your bucket list?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Doubt it. What kind of content could there possibly be besides drama in an RV crammed with a bunch of strong personalities who are stuck with each other for 5 days? Notice whenever things get dull, someone starts an argument. It's all they can do with what they have to keep you watching. This is why Brandon even began to mess with Cassandra. Brandon even mentions that in this clip that they're friends again once the camera is off and that most of the hurtful things said are just because of the stream. Unless fists fly, I won't really take any of this beef seriously. It seems to be simply forced content in otherwise boring situations. Without the beef this stream would be called: "8 SITTING ANDYS IN AN RV (except at stops because then there's stuff to do)" Let's be honest!</TEXT>
