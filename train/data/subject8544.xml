I drew the characters initially big and then downsize them using the select tools in MS Paint. I followed all the rules. Can #8217;t you let it pass ?

    <TEXT>Currently I #8217;m really interested in 19th century Europe. Like it was really a dramatic period in European history which saw lots of changes. It #8217;s really hard to believe that all thoese political movements ( nationalism, liberalism, imperialism, socialism ) and all those different kinds of artistic movements ( neo classicism, romanticism, realism, etc ) as well as the Industrial Revolution and several new discoveries ( which, consequently led to the issue of social discrimination and racism *cough* Social Darwinism ) could all happen in the span of 100 years Also, my favorite historical figure from this time period has got to be Bismark. I know it #8217;s kind of cliche since the due is already so famous, but boi can I resist those Prussian Virtues</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I just encountered a guy in a history group on FB, and he claimed that The Medieval period in Europe ended after the French Revolution, because, to quote him,  #8220;some scholars said so #8221;. Boy even went further and said that anything in France prior to king Louis XVII was  #8220;horrible #8221; and when I asked him for the sources of the  #8220;information #8221; he just provided, he straight- up responded :  #8220;Why the fuck do you need sources ? Isn #8217;t it already obvious ? #8221; I swear, it was even worse than The Chart ( did I bring up the part where he said life in Medieval Europe was more horrible than in the period after the French Revolution and used the same  #8220;It #8217;s already obvious #8221; kind of logic above ? )</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This was some pretty good read, if you ignore some of the bias and over generalization from the author . But yeah, if every amateur were perfect, we wouldn #8217;t have scholars Also, i just wonder, to what extent is it accurate to call the Polish - Lithuanian Union  #8220;liberal #8221; during their time ? After all, that term wasn #8217;t invented much later and kinda takes on a different meaning nowadays</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yep. Also, the information you just provided is really detailed. Thanks And you #8217;re right. Carolus Rex certainly got balls. At 15 he had to deal with the armies of Denmark-Norway, Poland-Saxony and Russia invading, and still won as a commander against all of them at the start of the war Also, it #8217;s no surprise that he could defeat the opposing sides even when being outnumbered.
