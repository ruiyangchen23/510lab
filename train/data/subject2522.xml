    <TITLE>Siege PC Hijack? Please help</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-07-30 23:47:41</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I was playing Siege last night and nothing was out of the ordinary until I went to see the scoreboard, and saw that a friend request was suddenly sent out without me doing anything. I thought it was just a glitch at first but it happened again after that. I get on today thinking it was just pure coincidence, the first game I join it happened again- note that all the friend requests are people in the same game as me. Apparently it happened to them as well and it got even weirder. Things were being said in game chat that I never typed out, and it's not only me. Someone on the enemy team kept typing the letter "T" to which he never typed out in the first place. In my case "lol" was typed out and even "someone tk me". I thought it was a glitch at first but it seems way too specific to be just that. I added the other guy who kept saying "T" and he said he never typed any of those things either, and he had never sent or accepted any friend requests from me. Has anyone else been experiencing this? Hoping my pc wasn't hijacked or anything and it doesn't seem to be only me. Any advice would be appreciated.</TEXT>
