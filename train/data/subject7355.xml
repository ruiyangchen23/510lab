    <TITLE>Prescribed Medications Not Working, Should I Go Back to Alcohol?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-04-11 13:53:21</DATE>
    <TEXT>Long story short, my official diagnoses is, in order of prevalence and importance: Generalised Anxiety, OCD, Major Depressive, Anorexia, Exercise Addiction. Since 2008, I've been on countless combinations of meds. My psychiatrist guesstimated it'd be close to 30. The longest anything has ever really "worked" is 4 months with aropax. Pre-prescription drugs I was a high functioning alcoholic. I graduated university, had 2 jobs and a girlfriend, and played sport at a high level. I went on holidays, i went overseas, I was a normal human. Once I quit alcohol for good in 2011, my mental state slipped dramatically. I am now a hollow shell compared to the person I once was. I have very little social life, play no sports, have no sex drive, and I'm unable to go on holidays, to sit down for more than an hour... Basically, my life isn't a life, it's survival mode. Am I being silly in thinking maybe alcohol could have been helping me? It may have been masking my major problems, but I've spent countless hours (must be close to... I don't even know, 800?) in therapy in the last 8 years working through my major problems and I only seem to be deteriorating. My body struggles with the anxiety and depression, to the point I can't even put a shirt on because my neck and shoulders are so tense. So... Should I go to my psychiatrist (who I have a great and honest relationship with) and ask if alcohol might be a better solution? Or is that just silly?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Why CBT Was Making Me Worse (Letting go of intrusive thoughts)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-04-17 01:35:35</DATE>
    <TEXT>Just a short post, with an observation that has helped me immensely and might help you too if you're suffering from unceasing generalized anxiety. I spent 8 years working on CBT (among other types of therapy). By mid-2016 I was at an all time low, but I was a superstar at CBT. I had internalised it. This was my process: - Taking note of my level of anxiety, identifying the worst case scenario, gathering evidence to either prove or disprove this worst case scenario, attaching a percentage to how likely this outcome was, then reassuring myself with how unlikely it was to occur. My new psychologist treated me instead for OCD, which does away with this completely. With OCD, I was encouraged to just "let go" of intrusive thoughts. Interacting with them gave them power. Acknowledging them made them more real. Part of CBT is going head-to-head with your anxiety and disproving it through fact and reassurance. If I were to drive through an orange light and think it was red (my mind loves to play tricks on me), with CBT I'd replay the scenario in my head and rate how likely the worst case scenario (getting a ticket) would be. This would also involve driving back to the intersection to see if any police were around and replaying the moment over and over in my mind. This was exhausting, especially with the amount of intrusive thoughts similar to this I was experiencing a day. Letting go of this was life changing. Of course, I haven't fully recovered. I'm about 2% into the journey, and I have set-backs constantly. But I am now re-learning how to listen to my brain. We all have intrusive thoughts, maybe you have the same as I do. But my mind seems to latch onto them, to take them as fact. If I feel bloated, I worry that I am constipated, which spirals into worrying about my health, my medications, whether I'll ever go to the toilet again... When I have to use CBT to deal with every single one of those thoughts, it's exhausting and counter-productive, especially as thoughts like this occur to me hourly. No, it isn't as easy as just saying "Let it go" like Elsa. As I said, it's been about 10 months of fortnightly sessions and I am 2% of the way there, it will take years for me to re-route my neural pathways. But maybe you're in the same position as me, wondering why you're a 5 star CBT player but not getting any better. Don't get me wrong, CBT is great! It just didn't work for me. Maybe this could work for you?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Some Advice For a First Time Sydney Visitor</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-04-17 10:28:47</DATE>
    <TEXT>My friend is coming out to Sydney next week, and she asked me a couple of questions that I feel you guys could give some incredible answers on. - Best place near Circular Quay/Rocks/Opera House for relatively cheap Kangaroo steak (I was thinking Blackbird Cafe, but it's a long way away and not so cheap!) - Can they touch the Koalas at the "Animal Encounters" tour at Taronga Zoo? - What is a good prepaid sim card with a decent amount of data (over 1gb) they can buy? What provider is best? - How does a temporary Opal Card work? Can they just buy one and then load money onto it as they go? They also want to see parts of Sydney tourists don't usually know about. I suggested: - A ferry to Watson's Bay to check out The Gap - A walk around Barangaroo to see the live art exhibit in the cutaway - A visit to Birkenhead Point for some discount shopping - A walk across the bridge and down to the water at Kirribilli - A walk from the Opera House around the water down to Woolloomooloo Anything I have missed? Thanks guys :)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Best Nuts in Sydney</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-04-19 14:24:21</DATE>
    <TEXT>I have to share this with you guys. Nut Roasters in Roselands (not the shopping centre, the industrial estate past the golf course) make the absolute best nuts in all of Sydney. I am a nut fanatic, and have had a good crack at just about everything out there. I have no idea what they do to make their roasted nuts so stunning. Mum bought me some pecans last week and it's like eating a cloud draped in caramel. Their prices are incredible too. Mixed salted nuts go for (off the top of my head) $12/kg, which is comparable to Nobby's. And these are gourmet. Anyone else know of this establishment? Anyone have a better and cheaper place to point me too?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Say, for instance, you're making a pound cake, and you have the choice between a generic butter block, or cultured butter. Would the average person be able to notice a marked difference in taste? I am planning on making the Crepe Cake for Mother's Day this Sunday, and naturally, I want to go all out. We're going to fill the layers with whipped cream and strawberries. The way I see it, the two places I can increase the taste of the dish is via the type of cream I use, and the type of butter used in the crepes and for the pan. Should I buy some delicious cultured butter, or will it just not make enough of a difference? Also, does double cream whip better than normal cream?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>OoTP: Why the movie is unfair on Harry</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-06-07 14:13:45</DATE>
    <TEXT>There seems to be a bit of animosity towards Harry's behaviour in the 5th book, but I think people might be swayed into viewing him in a negative light due to the movie. There are two specific scenes: - When Seamus confronts Harry about what happened in the Graveyard, and reveals that he almost didn't come back to Howarts, Harry says this in the movies:  gt; Well I guess you should read the Prophet then like your stupid mother Now, I haven't got my book on me, but I read that section 2 days ago and I am 99% certain Harry didn't use the word "stupid" with regards to Seamus' mother. - When Nagini attacks Arthur, in the books Harry is terrified for Arthur and feels awful being around the Weasley's. In the movie, Dumbledore is making arrangements to save Arthur's life when Harry yells "LOOK AT ME!" It makes him seem like he only cares that he had the vision, not that Arthur is almost dead. And rather than return to Grimmald Place to be with the Weasley's and see Arthur, Dumbledore sends Harry off with Snape. It all makes Harry look a bit selfish and rude, when in reality that isn't the case. He doesn't call Seamus' mother stupid, he merely defends himself. and he is desperate for Arthur to be ok, and is so scared that he might hurt someone else he considers running away! I don't think there is anything bad about Harry's behaviour in the books. He'd just witnessed a peer die at the hands of Voldemort, he's about as stable as possible!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>If The Movies Were Made Today Would We Get 2 or 3 Movies Per Book?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-06-12 13:55:08</DATE>
    <TEXT>I complain that the movies didn't include every little detail that the books did, but I believed that to be for obvious reasons. Movies aren't meant to be 4 hours long. Yet there is a trend now to make as many movies as possible based around either a single novel or comic (The Hobbit for example), or a single plot-point or character arc (Fast and Furious, all the superhero movies). I think one movie would suffice for the first 3 books, but after that I think they could easily have made 2-3 movies per book, doubled the lifespan of the franchise and probably tripled their income. Only problem I foresee is the kids growing up too quickly during filming.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Why Didn't Ginny Join the Trio and form a Quartet?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-06-15 13:26:24</DATE>
    <TEXT>I never really wondered this, I just accepted that she wouldn't be part of their hunt for horcruxes, but I was re-watching DH1 today and at the wedding I saw Ginny throwing hexes as the death eaters invaded. It got me wondering why she wasn't even considered. Here are some reasons for and against. For (Ginny completing a quartet) * Her and Harry are dating, so her loyalty is unlikely to waver, plus it'd give each peace of mind that the other is safe * She has proven herself a highly capable witch through the DA and the debacle the Ministery * She appears to be the most natural leader among the four. Harry is reluctant to take charge and does so only when thrusted into it. Ron shows little aptitude during his tenure as a prefect, and Hermione is intelligent but is unable to keep Ron from leaving or keep the spirits of the trio up. I believe Ginny would have a lot more luck under these circumstances in raising morale * She's had first-hand experience with Voldemort/Riddle Against: - Not being of age, she still has the trace on her, meaning the ministry would be alerted any time she performed magic (sounds like a huge obstacle, but consider anyone not of age isn't allowed to use magic outside of the school anyway, so she'd be used to this) - Molly wouldn't allow it - Harry wouldn't allow it - Ron wouldn't allow it - Arthur wouldn't allow it - If two Weasley's went missing suspicion would rise dramatically, putting her family at risk Thoughts? It's not feasible for her to join them, but it'd be mighty interesting to see what happened if she did. How do you think things would have played out differently? Ron wouldn't have left because he'd not feel the jealousy at Harry and Hermione's friendship.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Favourite Fast Food Outlet?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-06-24 07:12:27</DATE>
    <TEXT>Was chatting to some mates the other day about the best fast food outlets in Australia. It goes without saying we had some disagreements. Me and a friend put together this list: 1. Generic hot food shop (the corner store we all know and love. Chiko rolls, fish and chips, greek salads, roast chicken!) 2. Subway (overhated, I don't get the Subway hate) 3. McDonald's (their range is legendary) 4. KFC (let's face it, bloody delicious) 5. Nando's (it's not a restaurant regardless of how they brand it) 6. SumoSalad 7. Red Rooster (Australian icon) 8. Ogalo (better than Oporto) 9. Hokka Hokka (expensive) 10. Guzman Y Gomez (pricey, and quality varies greatly) 11. Oporto (apart from the Bondi Burger they are overpriced) 12. Le Wrap (overpriced!!) 13. Hungry Jacks (terrible breakfast) 14. Harry's Cafe De Wheels (basically stadium food) Full list and explanations here: http://www.bensbigblog.com.au/2017/04/ranking-of-australian-fast-food-outlets.html As someone passionate about fast food (everyone has to have a passion right?) I'm interested to see what you guys think. Also, this is a list made from 28 years of living in NSW. Are there any chains outside of NSW that I missed out on?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Spells/Potions That Contradict Each Other</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-07-01 12:37:00</DATE>
    <TEXT>What determines the prevailing spell or potion? Is it the one cast or brewed by the more powerful wizard, or are some spells and potions more powerful than others? Examples: - Veritaserum Vs. Confundus Charm: Veritaserum forces the truth out of someone, but if they have been confounded to think or believe something different, what do they say? - Legilimens Vs. Memory Charm: We know Voldemort broke through Bertha Jorkins' memory, but could he do the same for the one Hermione placed upon her parents? - Legilimens Vs. Confundus Charm: A well-cast Confundus can convince a person they have certain memories that don't exist. Would legilimency show the planted memory or the real one? - Veritaserum Vs. Langlock and Tongue-Tying Curse: Would yopu be forced to write the truth down on a piece of paper?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Story Behind The Personnel On JAY-Z's 4:44</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-07-02 04:33:31</DATE>
    <TEXT>I took a deep dive into all of the personnel behind the record, and found some interesting things. The most interesting was the addition of Kim Burrell as a featured artist. In January, she was called out for making [homophobic comments](http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/la-et-ms-kim-burrell-homosexuality-perverted-20170102-htmlstory.html) during a sermon she delivered. Pharrell was just one artist who came out and condemned her words. I found it odd she'd be featured on the same album that Jay speaks about his mother's sexuality, and his unconditional acceptance of homosexuality. Also discovered that No I.D. has actually been involved in Jay-Z projects as far back as 1997, when he was an observer during the mixing and mastering of Jay's second solo album Vol. 1. A nice little tid-bit was something I learned about the mix engineer Jimmy Douglass. He's been working in the industry for 4 decades, and did a bit of work on Jay-Z tracks (including "Big Pimpin'") in the 90s through his association with Timbaland. I think we can all agree Jay's vocals are unlike anything we've ever heard before. It's very intimate and organic, and unpolished. It turns out that's somewhat of a trademark for Douglass (or "The Senator" as he is known). Also, did you know No I.D. actually made the "Control" beat and sent it to Jay first? Some nice quotes that prove the concept and sound of this album has been in the works for years.

    <TITLE>Dumbledore Asking Harry about Hermione in HBP [Movies]</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-07-07 10:47:01</DATE>
    <TEXT>About 36 minutes in, this exchange happens: Dumbledore: What about your activities outside the classroom Harry: Sir? Dumbledore: Well I notice you spend a great deal of time with Ms. Granger. I can't help wondering if.. Harry: Oh no. No. I mean, she's brilliant, and we're friends, but no Dumbledore: Forgive me, I was merely being curious This definitely isn't in the books from what I can recall. There are two possible explanations that I see: - Dumbledore is trying to ascertain whether Harry will be entirely focused on the tasks that Dumbledore has planned for him throughout the year. Being in love might cloud Harry's judgement, or cause him to split his time and energy between a partner and getting that memory from Slughorn. Remember, Dumbledore knows about the power of love. - The writers merely threw it in as a way of confirming Harry and Hermione are merely friends, a crude way of beginning the courting process between Ron and Hermione, and also Harry and Ginny. Seems like a really weird thing to put into the movie tbh.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I know I will get some hate for this, but I think there is a decent argument laid out in the article. I was never an Iggy fan until I heard "Mo Bounce", but I'd followed her story closely, and seen people call her out and constantly criticise her. The fact that she's still brave enough to release the music *she* wants to release in the face of such criticism is proof enough to me she's taking more risks than anything I am hearing in the Australian mainstream at the moment (the underground is different), although I devote a paragraph to Briggs and A.B. Original and their brilliant message on "January 26" and the 7:30 report on the song and the message. Anyway, downvote if you must, but give it a read if you're interested. I'm keen to know if anyone feels the same way I do. http://www.bensbigblog.com.au/2017/06/iggy-azalea-is-australias-most.html</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So Harry cops a lot of criticism for his obsession with Expelliarmus but I have no idea why.

It's like taking a cricket bat out of a batters hand, or a tennis racket off a player. Am I missing something? If you successfully disarm someone, their wand may switch allegiances, and they're entirely exposed and vulnerable to attack. How do you duel without a wand?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[Discussion] Would you read an in-depth piece on the theory of magic?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-07-12 13:40:53</DATE>
    <TEXT>The books don't give us much outside of very basic magic. Things like simple spells, charms, and incantations. Advanced magic isn't discussed unless it pertains to Harry and the story. Nor are the theories behind spells revealed. For example, we only see a few instances of a wizard or witch creating their own spell or magic: - Snape: Sectumsempra - Dumbledore: Deluminator - Molly: Magic clock - Marauders Map Let's take the Marauders Map. How does it work? There must be a principle in magic that it relies on. What spells did they use? Did they combine spells? We see things like Prior Incantatum, or the magic of love that saves Harry, but there must be millions upon millions of things like that out there. During Voledmort and Dumbledore's duel both wizards were casting non-verbal spells we'd never seen before. If J.K. Rowling published a textbook shedding some light on all the varying degrees of magic used in the series, and their origin, and how someone goes about creating a spell or modifying it, would you read?</TEXT>

Being Australian, we grew up on Don Bradman. He is a sporting God to us, no other sports player or athlete is measured against his achievements because it just isn't fair, and that includes legends like Ian Thorpe, Shane Warne, Cathy Freeman, Shane Gould etc. But what of the rest of the cricketing world? Is he seen as the greatest of all time, with no-one really even close to him? Do you think he is just a statistical anomaly, and that it was more circumstance than skill? I'm genuinely curious. Is Sachin viewed alongside Bradman? What about Sobers or Kallis?</TEXT>

I know it's a book, and i know it's fiction, but maybe I am missing something. Is this common in the UK? Is it like a "fairytale" kind of thing? Is it more common in the wizarding world?

Snape loved Lily from school time. I only know of one couple in real life that married after being high school sweethearts, and that ended in divorce 2 years later.

When I started going out for dinner, buying my own food, going on trips with her and seeing the trouble she had in restaurants finding something safe and enjoyable, or how she never looked forward to McDonald's because all she could eat were the fries, or how she hated bakeries because all she ever could eat were meringues, I realised she had probably missed out on a lot of food experiences I took for granted. So, I guess I decided I'd try and give her at least a small taste of what I'd been able to indulge in during my teens. Sausage rolls, neenish tarts, apple pies, caramel slices, Ferrer Roche, freshly baked bread (although my mum was much better than I), proper easter eggs, donuts, fish and chips, burgers, Twix, I even made her a bunch of Mint Slice biscuits once.

    <TITLE>Was Snape more powerful than Voldemort?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-07-26 13:03:51</DATE>
    <TEXT>I usually read the power rankings as Dumbledore, Voldemort, Grindlewald, Snape. But lately I've been thinking Snape is more powerful than Voldemort, and therefore than Grindlewald. No-one that I can recall has ever hoodwinked or tricked Lord Voldemort. Just Snape. Voldemort is said to be a master Legilimens, which means Snape must be an even stronger Occlumens, impressively strong. Both Snape and Voldemort have a penchant for potions, with Voldemort successfully executing a complex Regeneration potion, as well as producing a complex Emerald potion. Snape is the potions master, and in fact he was so good that his handwritten notes were able to be interpreted and executed by an underage wizard with such accuracy and clarity that Slughorn believed Harry to be just as good as Snape. I'd say Snape just beats Voldemort here. Snape and Voldemort are both capable of independent flight, no-one else in the books can do this. Both are superb duellists. Voldemort against Dumbledore, then against 3 Order members during the battle, he was doing more than holding them off even with a wand that wasn't his. Snape is even on this I feel. He duelled McGonagall *and* Flitwick, the latter who is a known duelling champion, and not only did he escape unscathed, he managed not to hurt them in the process. The "duel" with Harry was laughable. Harry didn't even get a chance to say the spell before Snape's shield charms threw him off his feet. This is a big one for me. He performed Avada Kedavra successfully when he clearly didn't want to. We know from Moody and Bellatrix that you "have to mean" the unforgivable curses, and Moody tells the fourth years they could all try and kill Moody at the same time and he would get a nosebleed at best. Snape does it under pressure, and appears remorseless. That takes a lot of power, like summoning a Patronus without any happy feelings. Finally, Love. Snape is capable of love, it is love that motivates him, it is love that finally kills Voldemort, a power he never took seriously. And Snape played a huge role in that. If it weren't for love, Snape would be a death-eater, Dumbledore will have never gained such a valuable ally, and Harry would never have had a protector of the same magnitude. If Snape is more powerful than Voldemort, why didn't he protect himself? Why did he allow himself to be killed? Did he believe Voldemort to be the more experienced duellist? Did the attack surprise him? I don't know why he didn't defend himself... But I think he could have.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2017-07-27 03:31:59</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I started free-form about a year ago, and I am a total newbie so I had about 10 dreadlocks on my entire head, huge conjoined ones. I spent 3 days last week separating, and I turned 10 into about 30. I am a cyclist, and when I had the conjoined ones washing my hair every second day didn't seem to be an issue. I honestly have to wash every second day because I sweat so much when I ride they would smell insane if I didn't. I know there are millions of threads on washing, how to wash, when to wash, what to wash with etc, but does anyone have any experience as an athlete on how to keep their hair dreadlocked whilst washing (properly washing, not a rinse with water) regularly? At the moment, some of my dreads aren't locked in super-tight, and I've been on this journey for 12 months, endured a lot of bad hair days, a lot of beanie in summer days, and a lot of ridicule from people who told me dreadlocks were disgusting and looked bad on me. They finally look good on me, I don't want to lose them all in 2 days. [Here](http://imgur.com/a/3THo2) are a couple of shots, I find it difficult to take pictures that really show my dreads because of the hair colour and loose hair. If another thread exactly like this exists can the mods or a user please show me to it?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I just want some clarification on fish and bones. My neighbour is an avid fisherman, and he gives us all manner of local fare from Sydney. The fish is whole, obviously, and his method for filleting or cutting it up is very basic and rough. - What bones should I be removing, and does it depend on the type of fish? Most commonly he catches blackfish, bream, flathead, the occasional leather jacket, and Whiting - When ordering fish in a restaurant, what is likely to have bones and what isn't? - If the fish I cook or order is full of small bones, how do I eat it in a timely, non-messy way, but ensure I don't eat any bones? I've watched a few videos on how to fillet a fish but a lot of them don't tell me about the small bones, and a lot say it can be difficult to do without ruining the fish. Any help or a direction to a link would be wonderful, thanks :)</TEXT>

Noisey also published an article at some point about it. I went deeper, and tried to answer the question, "Did Lil Wayne's Obsession With Pussy Hurt His Career?" I analysed every legitimate Lil Wayne song on Genius for the word "Pussy", and I came up with these hard facts: Total songs: 978 Total Pussy Mentions: 717 I answered the question in the article, I broke the references down by year and by project, and I've included all the hard data I collected via a link to another post. I analysed how many times per song Wayne uses it, how often his guests use it, and insights into which projects were most critically acclaimed and how "pussy" seemed to impact upon ratings and reviews.

I've looked into freeze dried, but haven't found a method or recipe I can get my head around. Is there a specific way to do it? Should I even be looking at freeze dried ice cream?

As the team ran onto the field the drums and opening section of "Black Skinhead" started playing. All these little kids were around me jumping up and down and air drumming or banging their seats. I said to my mate "Oh wow, they play Kanye before they run out?" Him: "Oh that's who wrote it? They play it every week and I thought it was something they just made themselves" I wonder if they're paying royalties. They once tweeted [this,](https://twitter.com/swanssupport/status/506273660869423104) saying "Explicit lyrics but we edited out all the lyrics and it's just the base line".

    <DATE>2017-08-10 13:18:42</DATE>
    <TEXT>I am attempting to come to some sort of statistical conclusion as to which rapper has the most impressive longevity. Thus far I have my data set up with the following columns: - Album No. - Average critical review score - Album sales (US) - Chart position (Billboard 200) I have then been looking at the correlation between the album number and the other 3 columns to determine if the more albums they put out, the less relevant or successful they are. This doesn't account for how many years they have been rapping though. Jay-Z released 12 albums in a 17 year period, but LL Cool J released 12 albums in a 23 year period. If all else was the same (sales, critical reviews, chart position), how would I use excel or another tool to draw a concrete conclusion about who has the most longevity? I am defining longevity as popularity over either a period of time or as it relates to how many albums they have released. [Here](http://imgur.com/a/SD649) is a portion of my data set.

    <TEXT>I have a data set that consists of the career statistics of 37 rappers: - Albums released - Avg critical score of each album - US sales of each album - Peak chart position of each album - What year in their career the album was released - What year the album was released I am trying to statistically display longevity, answering the question "Which rappers have remained relevant and successful over the course of their career". I don't really know how to go about doing that. I can use graphs to plot sales, critical score, and chart positions over time. But Jay-Z released 12 albums in 18 years, whereas LL Cool J released 12 albums in 28 years. If all things were equal in that comparison (sales, critical score, chart position), LL Cool J would have the best longevity, how would I represent that? I'd also like a way to determine whether releasing albums over a shorter period of time is more effective than releasing them over a longer period of time. I'd like to know whether the variance in years between albums can predict sales, chart positions, and critical scores. I'd also like to try and figure out statistics about certain decades: did these rappers sell more in the 90s, 2000s, or 2010s? Is there a way I can do this easily via Excel? [Here](http://imgur.com/a/XTb0b) is a screen shot of the top of the data set I am working with. Thank you!

    <TEXT>I have a data set that consists of the career statistics of 43 rappers: - Number of Albums released - Avg critical score of each album - US sales of each album - Peak chart position of each album - What year in their career the album was released - What year the album was released Two things I'd like to do: Who has achieved the greatest longevity? Complications are that I am comparing artists who release records on different time lines. LL Cool J and Jay-Z have released almost the same number of albums, but LL Cool J was around a decade before Jay. Can I just compare the means of the variables critical score, sales, and chart position? If I wanted to determine consistency, should I use the standard deviation to determine who is the most consistent over the course of their career? Is there another measure I can use? I'd also like to answer the question "do rappers lose relevancy and popularity as their career progresses". Can I simply conduct correlation tests and use the correlation coefficient to draw conclusions about whether the passing of time influences album sales/critical scores/chart positions? Or do I need to do a Regression? [Here](http://imgur.com/a/XTb0b) is a screen shot of the top of the data set I am working with. Thank you!

    <DATE>2017-08-14 12:51:30</DATE>
    <TEXT>Game of Thrones has me thinking about the subtleties that lie in seemingly straight forward narratives and characters. Jaime Lannister, Tyrion, Daenerys, Bron, Varys, Sansa. Their decisions and actions are rarely black and white, there is a lot of grey area. The only time I feel I've encountered that in HP is through "The Greater Good" that Dumbledore and Grindelwald were rallying under, and when Barty Crouch introduced harsh, previously illegal measures to combat the death eaters (usage of the unforgivable curses). All the major characters fall at either end of the good or bad spectrum, unless I am much mistaken. Snape is the closest to a multi-dimensional moral compass, but even he merely switches sides. Maybe a character like Draco is an example of my point. He does a truly terrible thing, but he appears to be stymied by the threats of Voldemort. Are there any other character arcs I've missed? Or is there an underlying message of moral complexity? Or is it a good vs evil battle to the death?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>What are J.K. Rowling's strengths and weaknesses as a writer</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-08-19 13:43:40</DATE>
    <TEXT>My opinion: Strengths: - Story-telling. The best story-tellers suspend your disbelief without prompting or effort on your part. It's safe to say Harry Potter does this, comfortably. - Turning a want into a need. Generations of kids never knew they needed to be a wizard or a witch until HP, now we're all waiting for our letter... - Emotional intelligence. The way she treats things like Luna losing her belongings, Ron's feelings of inadequacy, Hermione's growing infatuation with Ron, the nerves before a big sporting event etc tells me she is a deep thinker when it comes to humans and our interactions. - Empathy and compassion. It can't be easy for a female adult to write an authentic and believable teenage male lead, but she created Harry, a brilliant character, and Ron, an even more brilliant character. She didn't fall back on stereotypes too often either - Great analogies. Dementors representing depression, the exemplification of the Good vs. Evil battle, capturing the destruction of war, and the way she took on politics and the struggle for power that comes at the expense of the masses (think Voldemort's thirst for power, Fudge's refusal to give up his power, and Dumbledore and Grindelwald's power struggle). - She writes in an easy to understand style. No trickery or thesaurus plundering. She says it up front, the same way we all think, so it's easy to connect. Weaknesses: - Poor world-building. More information is needed on spells, theory, history etc. She is helping to fill in the blanks via Pottermore, but it's a really convoluted way. - Character development outside of the Golden Trio. We see Neville gain confidence and change his story arc, but there isn't a huge amount of character building elsewhere, just revelations (Snape, Dumbledore). Dumbledore, well we know little about him. Ginny is shy around Harry, but that's hardly worth mentioning. Everyone else remains relatively static. - Plot holes. It seems some of the plots weren't terribly well thought out. The entire fourth book revolves around a really weird "need" to get Harry to that Portkey, which had its own problems. Surely there were other, less complex ways. We see things like the unbreakable vow, secret keepers, lack of maths and english classes, the fact that wizards have no idea about muggles despite living in exactly the same world, Triwizard Tournament and its lack of spectator spectacle, *that* Portkey, the powerful expelliarmus spell being treated as childish, getting food, the Thestrals. A lot of these things required Rowling to try and explain them after the books had come out. - No risks. There aren't many risks whatsoever in HP. The epilogue is a prime example, it's spit-shine clean and almost sickeningly so. - Lack of foresight. Something like the Thestrals must be explained, the implications of time travel requiring all the time turners to be destroyed, the fact she destroys Snape's redemption by having him constantly treat Harry unfairly Thoughts?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have collected the sales, critical review score, chart position, and age when album was released data for 570 hip hop albums released between 1980 and 2017. What I'd like to do is discover if there is a correlation, or maybe more than that, between the age an artist was when they released the album, and critical score, album sales, or chart position. What I've got is a huge data set with all this information. I run a regression analysis with the independent variable being "age when album was released" and the dependent being "album sales", and my R Square is 0.09 (p value is significant) It seemed weird to me, so I gathered the independent variables (ages 17 through 56), and I calculated the mean album sale for each of these years of age. My R-Squared is now 0.52... How do I interpret this? I am a bit of a rookie, I want to somehow quantify the impact that age has on my 3 dependent variables, but if I average them off I get higher R-Square, and if I run the analysis on the raw data I get a low R-Square.</TEXT>

Today she sprinkled some cinnamon into the pizza dough so that after we'd eaten our savoury pizza, she made dessert pizza by putting nutella, PB, and, wait for it, pomegranate! It was stunning! The other day she decided to add blue cheese to her omlette, and then drizzled it in barbeque sauce. The sweetness of the BBQ sauce was a perfect foil to the sharp blue cheese. my favourite thus far has been the way she used lemon jam that was way too tart. She cooked 2 crumpets, warmed the jam in the microwave, slathered the crumpets in proper butter, than drizzled the jam on as if it were maple syrup. I am a competent cook when pressed, but I don't have any kind of intuition for flavours and textures and pairings. Is it something you are born with? Is there anyone you know who is a natrual cook?

    <TEXT>I live in Australia, and it can be hard to pinpoint our national cuisine or cooking technique at times. We eat a lot of seafood, but also a lot of lamb and beef. We barbeque a lot, but that isn't unique. We sell Kangaroo, Emu, and Crocodile meat, but barely anyone I know eats it or cooks with it (because of cost and difficulty to prepare). Our most well-known foods are scattered all over the place: - Vegemite - Lamingtons - Pavlova (sorry NZ I know you guys did Lammos and Pav first) - sausage sandwich - Iced Vovo - musk sticks - Tim Tams - Chiki Rolls etc etc. You cant really look at that list and say "oh, this is a national cuisine", like say the Mediterranean diet, or pasta and pizza, or fresh fish etc etc. I don't feel a connection to our food culture, and I find it hard to make an Australian meal more than once or twice a year because it's usually roast lamb, roast potatoes, beer, mint sauce, and pavolva for dessert. Or, we just buy 2kg of Prawns and sit around eating. Anyone else feel like their country has a really muddled national cuisine?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It would have to be [Lisbeth Salander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisbeth_Salander) for me. She is hyper-intelligent, but a total lone-wolf. The idea of collaboration never sits comfortably with her, but she is open to the idea if it will further her own agenda. Differences: - There would likely be no "Golden Trio". While Lisbeth has friends, she isn't particularly close with them, nor does she display affection. I believe her and Dumbledore would be the master plotters, Dumbledore did what had to be done despite emotions and Lisbeth could care less about his motivations and emotions as long as the job gets done. - We wouldn't make it to the 7th book. Lisbeth is a mastermind at obtaining information. I'd say she would have figured the prophecy out, either through Dumbledore or other means, by the age of 14. I doubt she'd hang around at Hogwarts for a few years if she knew what had to be done. - Voldemort wouldn't stand a chance. Lisbeth thinks 5-10 steps ahead of everyone else. Incidents like The Department of Mysteries would never have happened. - This then negates the scene in the forest, where Harry dies for the people he loves. Lisbeth falls in love, but it's a slow burn and we get the impression it's a foreign concept to her. I think she'd be much more calculating, I doubt we'd get anywhere near a scene where Voldemort is waging open war. - I'd also guess that most of the wizarding world would never know if she managed to vanquish the Dark Lord. Lisbeth works in the shadows and avoids the spotlight at all costs. Not to say Harry courts the attention, but I think Lisbeth would be better at diverting it or hiding from it. Thoughts? Who would you choose, and why?</TEXT>

    <DATE>2017-08-29 01:14:58</DATE>
    <TEXT>We've all heard the ageism debate. Dust-heads, golden era, old-heads. Ageism implies that no-one can remain relevant, successful, and consistent past a certain age. We can point to outliers like Dr. Dre or Jay-Z as proof this isn't true at all, but that's qualitative data that is open to subjectivity. Quantitative data, that is the facts, figures, and statistics, is a way of proving beyond doubt that ageism doesn't exist. So I crunched the numbers. I gathered data on sales, chart position, and critical review on 570 albums from 68 artists/groups relevant to the ageism debate, I plugged them into Excel, and I used graphs and statistical analysis tools to prove unequivocally that ageism does not exist. Here is the full article: http://www.bensbigblog.com.au/2017/08/by-numbers-ageism-in-hip-hop-doesnt_28.html I've outlined my method, how I chose who to include in my data-set, the limitations of the tools I used, and I have included multiple graphs which not only look good, they help prove my point. Give it a read if you're interested. I'm also planning to do a few more articles that are solely based on statistics. If this is something you enjoyed or are interested in, let me know.

    <TITLE>By the stats: Australia's best Asian touring side 1995-2017</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-08-31 14:04:48</DATE>
    <TEXT>Did some Statsguru analysis, here is a team that would surely win *something* in Asia: 1. M. Hayden (1663 @ 50.39, 4 centuries): No brainer. He was merciless in 2001, averaging 109.80 and his use of the sweep completely negated the Indian bowlers. 2. Mike Hussey (1198 @ 63, 4 centuries): I've shoe-horned him into the opening slot because no-one else really deserves it. Warner averages 32, and before this recent century looked woeful. Taylor averaged 69, with 766 runs, but 334 of them came in one innings. Jacques averages 66 from one innings. Hussey can open, and his stats in Asia are incredibly good, he has the highest average on this list by a long margin. He's also scored over 1000 runs, a sure-fire sign he has the consistency and experience. 3. Ricky Ponting (1889 @ 42, 5 centuries): His average isnt quite as high as some above him, but he's our most experienced Asian campaigner. Tactically, I think Smith remains captain, but Ponting is one of the all-time greats, he'd do major damage in the prime of his career, especially if not burdened by leadership. 4. Steve Smith (1126 @48.95, 4 centuries): Only batsman in the current squad I've seen look comfortable on Asian pitches. He's looked god-like at times. He is tactically more aware than Ponting, and more aggressive where needed. He carried that side in India and Sri Lanka. 5. Damien Martyn (909 @ 45, 4 centuries): People forget just how hard he focuses and works on technique because he looks beautiful at the crease. That year when he hit a purple patch and was scoring centuries at will coincided with tours of Sri Lanka and India. He can also swing the ball with his medium pace. 6. Darren Lehman (686 @ 45.73, 2 centuries): Australia really should be learning quickly from Lehman. He used his feet expertly, dashing down the wicket when needed, then sticking back and either sweeping or cutting. A very diverse cricketer, who can roll his arm over if required. 7. Adam Gilchrist (821 @ 37, 4 centuries): Tim Paine averaged more, but has only played 2 tests. There is no competition for Gilchrist. He changed the way the game is played, and he is integral to any team he is picked for. 8. Shane Warne (106 @ 25.88): Don't need to explain this one. 9. Mitchell Starc (33 @ 25.96): I placed him above Hazelwood simply because we already have McGrath in the side. No test team since the great West Indian dynasty would pass down the opportunity to have Mitchell Starc in their side. 10. Glenn McGrath (65 @21.73): These figures are god-like. He can bowl long spells, is resistant to injury, and would make full use of the new ball. Will go down as our greatest fast bowler IMO. 11. Stuart MacGill (36 @ 26): Lyon has almost twice the wickets, but he is far more expensive getting them (average of 34.70), and his strike rate is significantly worse (61 vs 45). In fact, MacGill's strike rate is on par with Starc. He turns the ball sideways and has a wicket wrong-un that basically rolls along the ground on bad decks. 12. Ryan Harris (11 @ 14): This is no dig at his injury-prone body. I think we'd all have liked to see what Harris could have done over there at full fitness. He just edges out Andy Bichel, a workhorse of monumental proportion.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I took some time off baking to pursue other hobbies (blogging being the main one). I also suffer from depression, which complicates my energy levels and ability to become enthused about certain things. I bought 5kg of flour last week and I just haven't found the desire or drive to use it yet. I created [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Breadit/comments/6u1tbn/looking_for_exotic_exciting_complex_bread_recipes/?st=j737cn8e amp;sh=f4947ddc) to get some ideas on a recipe that would excite me and entice me to put the apron back on, but it hasn't really worked. What works for you? What do you get out of baking? Is it the complexity of the recipe? The joy of baking for others? A desire to experiment and challenge yourself?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Local nut shop has incredible roasted nuts, it's got me enthused about them for the first time in my life. They make really nice chili and garlic macadamias, but apart from that and Wasabi macadamias and vienna everything, they don't offer any other flavour combinations. What is the process of adding a spice/herb/sugar/salt/etc etc to a nut so that it sticks and imparts the most flavour possible? How do I get the flavour to actually stay on the nut? And how do I salt nuts if they arrive unsalted, so that the salt sticks? Thanks!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've fallen out of the loop as I no longer subscribe to any magazines, so I am not as well-versed in food trends as I once was, but here are some I loved and miss and some I don't miss at all Bring it back: - Hybrids like Cronuts, Crogel, Baissant, Cragle, Duffin, cookie shot glass, Mallomac, Wonut, etc etc. They all showed ingenuity, creative thinking, and baking science! - Cauliflower pizza: self-explanatory! It tasted like a pizza and it was nowhere near as heavy as a full dough pizza. - Gluten-free: as a GF baker for my celiac sister, this was freaking amazing. We went from having to swap flour mixes at get togethers to turning up to restaurants with 85% of the menu GF. - Crepe Cakes! - Mirror glaze cakes - Trans fats being exposed for what they are - More general awareness of health and how nutrition plays into that. Things like reducing sugar intake, star ratings on foods, listing ingredients per 100g, I think it's been super helpful for people to make the write food choices - Comfort food: enjoyed success in the mid 2000s and it's inspired a generation of new cooks to embrace the casserole and potato bake - McDonald's giving control of an order back to the customer, with create your taste and more gourmet-like menu items. Let's hope everyone else follows suit - Crazy milkshakes! Delicious - Eating challenges Never again: - Bone Broth. It's just stock. - Menus that aren't printed in the primary language of the country the restaurant is in - Sliders. They're pointless - Serving everything on a cutting board. Makes zero sense to me - Kale everything. Kale is gross to be honest - Foams. When was the last time you found found appetizing? - Raw food. Unless it's a capcisum. - The rise of the outspoken vegan. I am vegan but I think I've told 3 people, all of whom asked why I didn't order meat at dinner - Anything to do with some kind of detox. They are so expensive and there doesnt seem to be any evidence to suggest they work. - Instagramming your food. I saw a girl balance an elaborate cupcake on the top of a garbage bin once to get a good photo. Yuck - Demonizing sugar. If you understood how the energy systems of the body work, you'd recognise sugar is not the enemy at all, in fact it can be incredibly beneficial There are probably many more but I'd love to hear some you've embraced, you miss, or you would never like to see again. -</TEXT>

I do as well, but they don't exist anywhere anymore. So, why not make it myself? Well, no recipe exists that I can find, so I have to start from scratch.

Now I daresay that "wafer tube" is similar to a wafer stick, hollowed out, and either stuffed with marshmallow, or, more likely, made and allowed to set around a shaped marshmallow. I'd say it is then dipped in chocolate. Does anyone have any idea how i can go about creating a recipe? How difficult would it be to make the marshmallow, shape it into a tube, cover it in wafer, then dunk in chocolate? cross-posted with r/recipes</TEXT>

    <DATE>2017-09-07 14:04:48</DATE>
    <TEXT>I used to think it was cheese, but there are so many types of cheese, but only one mainstream type of egg. - Eggs can be the basis to build a meal on. Stacking and folding an omelette is a prime example, or things like quiches - They're essential in baking. ["Eggs add structure, leavening, color, and flavor to our cakes and cookies"](http://joythebaker.com/2013/10/baking-101-why-we-use-large-eggs-in-baking/) - Eggs bind. We use them to make things stick to other things, like battering or breading chicken, or keeping meatballs together - Eggs are the basis for some incredible desserts. Custard, flan, meringue, souffle - Eggs can be eaten by themselves! This is what sets them apart from butter, salt, garlic, sugar etc. You can poach an egg and it's a meal. - Eggs add texture to dishes.Stirring them through fried rice or pasta give the meal more depth. You can add an egg to so many things: a steak, a pizza, a piece of toast - Egg has a lot of great buddy foods. Bacon and egg, sausage and egg, cheese and egg, ham and egg - You make custard from eggs I can't think of another ingredient like this. You can eat it every single meal of the day, every day, and never get bored. Shout out to the egg.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I love seeing a special. I'll grab 5kg of my favourite peanut butter if it is on special. Same with my favourite chilli sauce. Some foods might be tempting to buy in bulk when on special, but can deteriorate quickly, especially if exposed to air. Things I have found difficult to buy in bulk: - Capsicums. They don't seem to freeze well, and if they're already on special chances are they're quite old and won't last too long in the fridge - Roasted nuts. They seem to lose much of their flavour within 5-10 days. You can freeze them, but they take up a lot of space - Bread. Unless you eat a LOT of it, I don't see the utility in buying more than 1 loaf at a time. Sure, you can freeze them, but the you'd have to separate every slice and freeze it separately to save space in your freezer and so you don't ever have to try and pry two slices of frozen bread apart. - Eggs: unless you use them quick. They can be frozen but it's a fiddly process in my experience - Fresh milk: obvious reasons - Dips that don't freeze well, such as anything with a lot of dairy in it - Ricotta cheese, cottage cheese. Don't freeze too well. - Strawberries freeze rock solid, as does water melon Any other foods you wish you could buy in bulk, but just can't?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've never come across such an item before, it may be entirely unique. This tea towel performs so many functions in the kitchen, defying [bacertial growth laws](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21592775) via previously undiscovered magical powers: - It can be used as an alternative to hand-washing. A quick wipe on the tea towel and all germs, stains and odours are immediately vanished - It's great at mopping up any and all spills. Milk? No worries. Did you drop pasta sauce? All good! Did you drop some raw mince on the counter top? Tea towel to the rescue - It actually dries things too. And despite being used for so many other applications, the plates and utensils are perfectly clean after being dried by our experienced tea towel - It is the go-to kitchen device to dry hands after giving them a wash - It's fantastic for lifting up a tray of raw meat and putting it into the oven, and it's even better when the food is cooked and you need to take it out again. Same tea towel, no worries - It can easily go two months between washes, and when you do eventually wash it, it can be thrown in with your clothes and regular washing, and merely needs an eco-cycle on cold to be completely stain and bacteria free! Has anyone else ever come into contact with something similar? Or is this totally unique as I assumed?</TEXT>

I just don't want to have to rely on celebrities sharing my articles.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Does anybody feel isolated in Sydney?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-09-15 13:32:16</DATE>
    <TEXT>My friend moved here 2 years ago. The Sydney dream: sun, beaches, beautiful people, and friendly Australians. Alas, my friend has struggled to integrate into the Sydney scene. They opened my eyes to a whole other side of Sydney I never knew existed. My friend was born in the Middle East, and although he speaks fluent English, he finds it difficult to make new (Australian) friends and keep them. He told me Sydney is quite "cliquey", and that it's really difficult to break into those cliques especially if youre not a born and bred Aussie. Oddly, he said Melbourne is not like that at all. He's made friends in bars, in parks, even in the supermarket. What does everyone think? I was surprised. Having grown up in Sydney and lived here my whole life I guess I am lucky that I am part of certain groups, and now that i think about it, unless they're playing sport with us, we don't really add new group members. What are your thoughts?</TEXT>

Blue Mountains you can go adventure climbing and abseiling. Bangor you can go outdoor rock climbing. There are an infinite number of walks you can go on.

I've hit up 8-10 major cities, but I haven't been to America, I haven't been to Canada, nor South America or Africa. Sydney sucks for some things.

How hot does he need to start off at? How often does he need to eat chilli? How much chilli does he need to eat? We both want to make a pizza and not have to worry about adding chilli at the end, or adding chilli to every dish after we have served his portion. Leftovers are a big problem too in that sense! He might want to enjoy some pasta for lunch the next day and get a dose of Carolina Reaper. Any thoughts are appreciated :)</TEXT>

People seemed to think because I wore 4XL shirts when I was a medium at best that I wanted to be a rapper or that I was a "gangsta". In 2017, it's very popular, with dedicated stores (Culture Kings, Khrome etc) that sell some really good stuff. I still get disapproving stares but I think that's more for the dreadlocks.# How about your area? How do people react to streetwear?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Buying berries in Sydney is a lottery at the best of times. When Mum and I find a batch that aren't too sour or tart, we buy in bulk. I am dead against trying before buying. Our berries come in punnets, and I shudder to think of someone and their grubby hands picking through a punnet for a test berry and putting it back on the shelf. It happens, I've made my peace with it, but I won't be engaging in that behaviour. Why are berries here so tart? Is it a seasonal thing? Are there certain countries that produce sweeter berries? Do they become more sour over time? I can't even eat strawberries anymore because biting into a sour one is so unappealing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It seems like following the speed limit, stopping at stop signs, not queuing across intersections, not running yellow lights, adhering to roadwork speed limits, slowing down to 40 to pass buses when the lights are flashing etc etc is some horrible social crime in Sydney. It's a daily occurrence, and it isn't just a few people throwing their hands up in the air and cursing me out. I've been overtaken on blind corners over double lines at least 5 times, I've had people sit so close to my bumper that at night I can't even see their headlights, I've had people flashing their lights at me, pulling alongside me to abuse, and a lot of horn honking. And guess what? the main culprits aren't over-confident p-platers, in fact I'd say less than 5% of this stuff involves a p-plater. The vast majority seem to be middle-aged males and females, driving pretty much any type of car from a ute up to a 4WD down to a small car. How do you feel about road rules? Do you follow them to the letter? Do you hate people that follow them to the letter? If you're someone who tailgates, abuses, flashes lights etc, why do you do it? Is it merely road rage?</TEXT>

    <DATE>2017-10-02 12:19:13</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I cross-posted with HHH, this is an article I have been working on for a while. I counted every single time certain rappers mention themselves during album tracks. I analysed the discographies of J. Cole, Kendrick, Chance, Kanye, Nicki, Future, Big Sean, Drake, ASAP Rocky, Jay-Z, and Kid Cudi. [Here is the analysis](http://www.bensbigblog.com.au/2017/09/by-numbers-how-often-do-rappers-mention.html) [Here are the hard statistics](http://www.bensbigblog.com.au/2017/10/by-numbers-how-often-do-rappers-mention.html) Kanye placed 7th. He mentions himself 8.5% of the time, or every 11.9 words. That's significantly less than Nicki, at every 8.78 words. The whole narrative of Kanye being obsessed with himself might not be so true after all. His highest placed album was *TLOP* at number 12. 10.11%, a mention every 9.89 words, 27 mentions per song. Above it was *I Decided*, *Honest*, *Future*, *More Life* and *Pink Friday*, among others. Kanye's most self-references per word, of course, came during "I Love Kanye", at 28.7%, or every 3.5 words. This was NOT the most prolific in the data set, that was Nicki's "Right By My Side", at 28.83%. I've also included loads of other statistics. I analysed *Watch The Throne*, and Kanye mentions himself every 12.4 words while Jay is every 11.6 words. Kanye raps 2115 words total, Jay-Z 2518. I've broken down every single album in the data-set. Ye's lowest ranked album is *Late Registration* with 7.5%. His most word-laden song is "Last Call". Despite *Yeezus*, he doesn't really reference in the third person often. 214 times out of 37,064 words. I'm planning on doing a few more of these, so subscribe if you'd like to know about them when they drop. Thanks!</TEXT>

    <DATE>2017-10-04 00:40:02</DATE>
    <TEXT>I spent a few days going through all the press and news stories from the history of Tidal, Spotify and Apple Music, and what I discovered really boggled my mind. Tidal are lightyears ahead of any other streaming service when it comes to charity and contributions to not only music culture, but things like the fight for racial and gender equality and the mission to end police brutality, or the fight against AIDS. That's not to mention that Tidal pays significantly more per-stream than Spotify or Apple Music, and Tidal also does significantly more for independent artists than the other two. Here are my findings: http://www.bensbigblog.com.au/2017/10/by-numbers-tidal-does-more-for-music.html I really think it'd be difficult to make a case for either Spotify or Apple Music once you read the article. I have a subscription to both Spotify and Tidal, simply because I have a LOT of playlists on Spotify I don't want to lose. I know Apple Music has Beats 1, but if you don't care about the artist radio shows, then Tidal is just the better option in almost every single way.</TEXT>

So much oil, making sure it's the right temperature and stays the right temperature, trying not to splash it anywhere, waiting for it to totally cool, straining it, then funnelling into a bottle. Shallow frying takes a little longer, but you get that juicy mouthfeel and the maillard rection too. What are your thoughts? Any old school techniques you'd like to see have a renaissance?</TEXT>

I'd also change Harry, Ron and Hermione's reluctance to trust authority. In the second book they barn storm into the chamber when they could have alerted a teacher. When Harry and Ron fly the car to school... Why not just go back and find his parents and sort out another form of transport?

    <TITLE>Which character's perspective would be even more limited than that of Harry's?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-10-11 11:02:26</DATE>
    <TEXT>The ["third person limited"](https://blog.nathanbransford.com/2012/11/third-person-omniscient-vs-third-person.html) way the book is written means we see almost everything entirely through Harry's eyes, for better or worse. It means we also hate Slytherins and Snape, it means we barely know anything about Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff, it means we get [this scene,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LLBZ2Sj5fk) the culmination of an entire book where Harry seems to be very focused on himself. We don't get to see the caring side of Slytherin, we miss a lot of character development outside of basic teenage observations etc etc. But is there a character whose POV would be even *more* limited? Harry has been brought up to fend for himself. He was taught by experience that he and he alone is in charge of his own destiny, happiness, behaviour, etc etc. While his point of view is limited, it is understandable. I am thinking, characters will less capability for insight than Harry: - Dudley or Vernon. Dudley does show some growth towards the end, but it is miniscule. He's going to have to be away from his parents for a long time to really make any progress in emotional maturity. - Crabbe or Goyle. Since one of them (I forget who) burned the entire room of requirement down, it's fair to say they aren't going to offer a diverse perspective - Lockhart. Self-centred - Oliver Wood. Appears only to care about winning the quidditch cup, regardless of danger or personal injury or anything like that</TEXT>

    <DATE>2017-10-12 13:07:00</DATE>
    <TEXT>You have the really mean the unforgivable curses. Snape did not want to kill Dumbledore. Dumbledore rescued Snape from the death-eater path and gave him not only a chance to right his wrongs, but unwavering support and loyalty. And we know it tortured Snape to do what he did, which makes it incredibly impressive. EDIT: /u/clothy just [made a great point:](https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/75w9qo/snape_successfully_casting_avada_kedavra_against/doal6b9/)  gt; I'm sure that Snape really did mean it. He really meant to end his old friends pain and he really meant to stop a young boy from becoming a murderer. I think that's a perfect explanation and possibly the intention of Rowling.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Let's take salt as a given, because I think it is easily the most versatile. Oddly, a lot of condiments are very limited. Gravy goes great with chips or meat, but not with delicate fish, on bacon and eggs, in porridge etc. Sour cream is great in soups and on nachos, but it's hard to use it in any desserts or with any slab of meat. Soy sauce is too salty for a lot of foods, tomato sauce is really only great on beef, sausages and hot dogs. Tzatziki is great with hot food but kind of hard to eat as a dip or put on anything sweet. I feel like I am missing something. When you consider just how diverse an egg is, or milk, or bread, it seems condiments fall way behind.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Are mass-produced baked goods sold by supermarkets making home-baking slightly redundant?</TITLE>

    <TEXT>I baked because I love the challenge, I love to save money, I love the taste of what I make, and because I make totally unique things. In Australia we have these "hot bread" stores, small bakeries that produce amazing treats and breads and cakes for a tiny price. Think $1.50 for a croissant the size of the moon, or $1 for a cheese and bacon roll. Now, it's the supermarkets getting in on the act. Today I bought 6 huge gingerbread scones for $3 and they are delicious. On par with any home-made scone Ive ever eaten. Coles (in Sydney, Australia) also offers these "damper-inspired" buns, they are like eating the offspring of a pillow and a cloud. I'm seeing fewer and fewer reasons to bake. It's become more expensive, the taste advantage is basically lost, and it takes 6 hours instead of 6 minutes to go and buy something that tastes like it was homemade. it's a little disappointing. I justified my hours of baking with "it's cheaper", but now that it isn't in a lot of cases, I find it hard to justify baking for a huge portion of my day if it isn't going to work out cost-effective. I will still bake, but as a hobby rather than a necessity.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Lockhard is in the same area of the hospital as the Longbottoms. Yes, he is there due to his own actions, but his total loss of memory is jarring and not easy to contemplate. I am not sure what the intention was when Rowling wrote this character. Was this his karma? Was it a punishment for his previous acts and to obliviate Ron? If so, was it fair in your opinion? Or was this not a punishment, merely something that happened? I first thought his punishment, if it was one, was very harsh. But the "impaled on your own sword" line from I think Dumbledore changed my mind. He'd been doing it to years to others, and he tried to do it on a teenager. Only injustice is that he is in the same ward as the Longbottoms who were true heroes.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2017-10-23 12:42:58</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've always got a few ideas on the pipeline ready to be deployed on any rainy sunday. - Croissant crusted pizza. I will make the croissants myself, and instead of shaping them, I will leave them in their rectangle, bake them just enough, put the topping on, and finish baking. No idea what will happen but I am keen - Choco-taco station. I want to make a bunch of flat-bottomed chocolate tacos and, at our next gathering, create a serving station where you can put anything you want in there. Ice cream, toppings, ice magic, whipped cream, rum cake, fruits, smarties, etc etc - Hotdog Doughnut. A semi-sweet doughnut filled with mini hot dogs. I'd prepare the hot dogs first, then the dough, form it around the hot dogs into a proper doughnut shape, then deep fry - Cheese fries. I want to mash up my potato and mix it with a large amount of mozarella, then form my fries and batter them, maybe like a beer batter, deep fry, and then eat the potato gooeyness. - Bacon and egg cake. Haven't quite worked this out yet. I am thinking a quick bread of some kind, baked in a cake tin, with boiled eggs and large bits of bacon in the middle. Similar to [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZbSw8hRQoY) but a proper, fully functioning cake. - Banana french toasted sandwich. I want to make french toast, mash up some banana, put it in the middle, then turn that into a toasted sandwich. - Sausage roll with cookie dough instead of sausage. I love cookie dough, so wrapping it up in flaky puff pastry is a win. I want the cookie dough to stay raw, so I might bake my puff pastry around a mould, remove the mould, and pipe the cookie dough in after the fact. Yours? Do you have any advice on mine?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>James Potter as a literary device</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-10-23 13:04:36</DATE>
    <TEXT>Up until Harry discovers how James treated Snape during school (I forget which book it was), Rowling presents James as a hero, a model wizard, untouchable. Once Harry sees that James indulged in bullying at times, a lot of the esteem he held his father in was dashed. James achieves three things as a character: - He teaches Harry that everyone is fallible. Finding out your father isn't superman is something a lot of people have to go through, and Harry came out the other side having learned a lesson - It teaches Harry that perception is everything. I believe it's a big part of why he forgave Snape. He recognises that the narrative changes dependent on who's eyes you see it through. - That also might apply to the readers. We see Snape and Slytherin as evil and the enemy, because we see them through Harry's eyes. When we get a little more perspective it begins to make sense. The Malfoys are acting such because of fear. Kreacher is mad because of the way Sirius treated him. We as readers are challenged when James is seen tormenting Snape. Maybe Snape isn't so bad after all? It allows Rowling to break the shackles of the third person limited narration she employs.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>By The Numbers: 50 Cent didn't kill New York hip-hop, but Kanye West and Ebro did</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-10-23 23:03:31</DATE>
    <TEXT>Everyone has been talking lately (well, Ebro, 50and Budden) about who or what killed New York hip-hop, so I decided to have a look at the statistics and facts. I gathered data from 78 New York and NJ artists and groups who were popular during 1990-2017, and I analysed their discographies and careers (1400 singles, 500 albums), ran some tests, and tried to work out who or what contributed the most to the downturn in NY hip-hop during the mid-2000s. I managed to prove statistically that it wasn't 50 Cent, and his rivals didn't suffer as much of a downturn as we actually think (except for Ja Rule of course). Instead, it certainly appears that Kanye contributed heavily to it, inadvertently of course, when he defeated *Curtis* during their sales battle in 2007. [Here is the full article](http://www.bensbigblog.com.au/2017/10/by-numbers-50-cent-didnt-kill-new-york.html) [Here is the video analysis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1nf2T5iSow amp;t=13s) It's another article in my ongoing "By The Numbers" series, which may have already peaked tbh, since Anthony Fantano [did a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9fAVowpiEo) breaking down my last article. If you're interested in these kind of statistical pieces, follow me on YouTube, Twitter, or Facebook, or subscribe. I post every few weeks, these take a long time to research! Thanks</TEXT>

Delicious - Banana nice cream: Froze my mashed bananas into bars, breaded, fried, drizzled with honey, died, went to heaven, got sent back to earth because God wanted me to spread the word about my creation. - Scones/Muffins: Cannot recommend this enough. I just sliced in half and put them in the oil until they crisped up just enough.

    <TEXT>Recently, Ed Cowan, former Australian test batsman, was dropped from his state side, despite being the top run scorer for the competition the year before. The reason was to make way for a younger cricketer with more of a "future" as a test cricketer. But Ed is only 35! I wanted to try and work out whether 35 was too old, and how many years he conceivably had ahead of him provided form remains constant. The result is this article: http://www.bensbigblog.com.au/2017/11/by-numbers-too-old-lifespan-of-modern.html By analysing the careers of all the test batsmen who played past the age of 35 (after 1990), I discovered that the modern batsman doesn't experience a dramatic drop in average until age 40!! Please give the article a read, I went in-depth on test, ODI and T20I, as well as the Sheffield Shield. There are pie charts too. Were you surprised by these results?</TEXT>

    <DATE>2017-11-02 12:30:48</DATE>
    <TEXT>Living in Australia, I have a huge array of local food I can pop down to the market to buy. When something is out of season or outrageously expensive (bananas for example), I just switch to whatever is in season and cheap. How about if you live in a remote area, or a country that imports a lot of food (China, Germany etc)? Is it more expensive? Are you more limited for choice? Do you have fresh produce available or is most of it frozen?</TEXT>

I don't smoke or chew tobacco but a subtle flavour in something, like just a hint, I think would be really interesting and lift a dish, similar to how I grate dark chocolate into spaghetti bolognese or sprinkle milk chocolate onto my vegetables. I do need specifics though. Where to buy, how to buy, how to prepare, how much to use, does and donts etc</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A local watering hole does a raffle every month, and it's pretty fun. Every second prize is something wildly impractical. 7kg of corned beef, 10 litres of ice cream, 6 Durians, 10 jars of Vegemite, etc etc. You want to win the good prizes, the diverse meat trays or the vouchers. One of the rules is if you do win the impractical prize you can't just give it away to others at the pub. It isn't ethical or moral, it's against the rules. So I have 7kg of corned beef and I don't even like corned beef. What do I do with it? What kind of foods does it go with?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I stumbled across this phenomenon a few years ago. I made excess of my caramelized onion tomato sauce and froze it in portions. When I added it to my chicken 2 nights later I realised it was crunchy and delicious, and that i could almost eat it on its own. I then decided to try freezing pure cream in ice cube trays. The result was the rich, fatty cream I love with the texture of ice cream, which I also love. I've since frozen many fruits, cake slices, chocolate, muffins, I even froze some dates and they tasted amazing. It mainly seems to be sweet food. I've tried meat and it doesn't taste as good frozen, nor does bread or things like weet bix.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2017-11-06 11:35:33</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hazlewood and Starc were bowling very very very well. Super tight, moving it a little, they were almost impossible to get away, even for a single. The atmosphere at the ground was super tense. It was overcast, the NSW fielders were onto everything, and it became about survival, not stroke-making. I was with my dad and we were so excited to see how the three blokes trying to get a spot in the test side would handle the pressure and game situation. What we saw was super disappointing. In the space of about 13 balls Hazlewood had removed all three. None of them looked like they were on the same level as Hazlewood and Starc, and none of them had the patience to stick it out. A few overs after the carnage, Smith took them both off and brought on Henriques, relieving the pressure. If Marsh, Marsh or Cartwright had just got their head down and endured the rough period, respite would come, as Bancroft and Turner showed. They're just not on the same level as test cricketers. If the selectors continue to pick blokes who can't tough it out or can't do the hard yards, Australia will just continue to collapse every 4th innings, losing test matches as a result.</TEXT>

This is the ingredient list for Woolworths scones: Wheat Flour, Water, Sugar, Margarine (Palm Oil, Water, Salt, Milk Solids, Vegetable Emulsifiers (471, 472c), Natural Flavour, Antioxidant (304), Natural Colour (160a)), Raising Agents (500, 541, 450), Butter Milk Solids, stabilised Blend (Wheat derived) (stabiliser (440), Vegetable Emulsifier (472e), Enzyme, Antioxidant (300)), Thickener (1400), Salt, Vegetable Emulsifier (471), Egg, Natural Colour (160a).

    <TITLE>Australia's Health Star Rating: is it flawed or am I just being cynical?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-11-12 11:57:26</DATE>
    <TEXT>In 2014, Australia rolled out a [health star rating system](http://healthstarrating.gov.au/internet/healthstarrating/publishing.nsf/content/home) that scores foods out of five based on how nutritious they are. "The more stars, the healthier the choice." This little phrase is essential though: "It provides a quick, easy, standard way to compare similar packaged foods" This means foods in different categories can't be compared. But there is no readily available information on what category a certain food fits into. Is bread the same as cereal? Is ice cream the same as custard? Is yogurt the same as custard? This leads to weird results. Ricotta cheese is 1.5 stars, whilst reduced fat ice cream is 3 stars. Canola spray oil is 4 stars, but packaged soup is 3 stars. Olive oil is 3.5 stars, but so are some breakfast cereals. Olive oil is good for you, but it is very calorie dense. My problem is that the star rating is very prominent on food, but almost no other information is easily available on the packaging. Nothing that says what category the food is in or what other foods to compare it to, or how it has been calculated So someone walking by the freezer section sees a tub of ice cream at three stars, and puts down their 1.5 star Greek yogurt because it's half as healthy...</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I just bit into a delicious muffin. The sugar was prominent but not overbearing, and it was very moist. I'd consider it the perfect amount of sugar and fat, in proportion, to light up the endorphin train. A lot of people say sugar and fat together is a guarantee. PB+J, chocolate bars, magic shell and caramelized pecans are proof ot this. But is there a specific ratio that works best? Does it depend on the food? Does salt factor into it? What about sugar on its own? I find it just too much in jam, for example, and way too much with honey, but something like custard or ice cream I think is perfect.</TEXT>

Yesterday I was thinking, what is the least? What is something you can use for one specific thing and nothing else? At first I thought some sort of rich dessert, like magic shell. But you can use that for rocky road, topping ice cream, drizzled on a fruit salad, pavolva, in fact just about any cold dessert. So maybe it is cooking spray? [This article](https://adebtfreestressfreelife.com/12-unbelievable-uses-for-cooking-spray/) lists alternative uses for cooking spray, but they aren't food-related. But if all cooking spray does is prevent sticking of food and baked goods, is it even an ingredient? The non-stick coating on my pan does the same thing, and it isn't an ingredient. So, I thought of things like Weet-Bix, which are just big bars of wheat. But you can put so much on them! You can butter them, warm milk, cold milk, water, yogurt, honey...

He and his fiancee are vegetarian and have been since mid-teens, and they were considering whether or not to serve meat, since it's a big gathering (150 people) and involves a sit-down meal. I don't think they should have to serve meat, I don't think there is any obligation. Meat-eating isn't a special diet, and people can just as easily eat vegetarian food and not get sick. On the flip-side, we all want things to go well and smoothly, and for everyone to enjoy themselves. Rather than worrying all day about how people will react to an all-vegetarian menu, my friend wants to relax and enjoy the day and for their friends to enjoy it too. Has anyone else been in this predicament? I am sure most will say "don't serve meat", and that was my first thought, but maybe I am biased.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Post Malone has out-charted every hip-hop lead artist and group in 2017</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-12-07 00:08:35</DATE>
    <TEXT>I am working on a year-end chart analysis, and through gathering data I've discovered that Post Malone has actually spent more time in the top 20 of the album and singles charts of 2017 than any other lead hip-hop act. In fact, it's not even close. Here are the stats: http://www.bensbigblog.com.au/2017/12/by-numbers-post-malone-has-out-charted.html I did a bit more diving, and Post's *Stoney*, when compared with the other hip-hop releases of 2017 and 2016, has had an entirely unique chart run. It debuted at number 6 on the Billboard 200, but didn't hit its peak of number 4 until 323 days later! I've also compared Post's 2017 run to Bruno Mars and Ed Sheeran. Given his recent comments on hip-hop, he might consider switching genres. He has the numbers to do it. When you consider the stellar year that hip-hop has had on the charts (Kendrick, Drake, Migos and Future all released great albums), and the singles we've seen ("Bodak Yellow", "Humble", "Gucci Gang"), it's kind of weird that an artist like Post Malone is the one to experience the most endurance and success. He's sold a pretty staggering 12.4 million singles and albums this year.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2017-12-08 10:39:47</DATE>
    <TEXT>I went through the 1,169 reviews Pitchfork has published in 2017, and gathered some interesting data. - 33% of all reviews published were Rock. The next closest was Electronic, with 19% - Jazz had the highest average review score, while Rap had the lowest - Metal experienced the most variance in review scores, while Jazz was the most consistent - Despite Kendrick's DAMN. receiving the highest review for score a new album, his was the 28th highest review of the year. 27 Classic or Reissue reviews outscored him - Ed Sheeran's Divide was the lowest scoring record of the year The full article is here: http://www.bensbigblog.com.au/2017/12/by-numbers-pitchfork-review-statistics.html I've also compared 2017 to review scored from 2010-2016, and created some graphs and infographics: https://imgur.com/a/68NC1</TEXT>

The average rap review is 71.23, below the next worst of Pop/R amp;B at 72.09 Article is here: http://www.bensbigblog.com.au/2017/12/by-numbers-pitchfork-review-statistics.html Despite this, Kendrick's DAMN is the highest rated new release of the year, at 92. But Rap also has 3 of the bottom 5 scoring albums: 35: Yasiin Bey - December 99th 35: Hospin - No Shame 41: blackbear - cybersex Thoughts? Are you surprised? I went over the 2010-2016 review scores thanks to data from [Nolan Conway](https://twitter.com/nolanbconaway), and Rap's average review score was 73.76 in that period, the highest out of all genres other than Rock.

    <TEXT>I spent some time this month going over all of Pitchfork's 1169 published reviews for 2017, and came up with some pretty interesting stats. - Rock dominated, with 33% of all reviews written about rock albums. - Jazz was the highest reviewed genre. The average Jazz album scored 79.91, a massive jump on second, which was Global, at 76.65 - Rap fared the worst, with an average review of 71.23 - Ed Sheeran picked up the worst review of the year, with 28 for Divide - Kendrick's DAMN was the highest rated new release with 92 - Pitchfork gave out 12 perfect scores of 10/10 or 100, all to classics and reissues - Their average review scores are increasing dramatically from the previous 6 years Full article is here: http://www.bensbigblog.com.au/2017/12/by-numbers-pitchfork-review-statistics.html Thoughts? I wasn't particularly surprised. Their genre classifications are a bit weird though. Lumping pop and R amp;B into the same category is odd, and labelling Divide as Rock was a bit different</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Lil Wayne Remixes Have Coincided With 325 Dropped Places on the Hot 100</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-12-23 00:11:42</DATE>
    <TEXT>Dedication 6 drops on Christmas Day, so I thought I'd dive back into Wayne's previous mixtapes (from the original Dedication onwards) to see what impact his remixes have had on the chart positions of the original songs. http://www.bensbigblog.com.au/2017/12/lil-waynes-mixtape-remixes-have.html Over the course of the 10 official solo mixtapes since Dedication 1, the tracks Wayne raps over have lost a combined total of 325 places on the Billboard Hot 100 directly after his remix is released. On the other side, tracks he has rapped over have only gained 115 places directly after Wayne's remix, and 25 of those places belong to "We Takin' Over" by DJ Khaled, a track Wayne himself raps on. These stats are a correlation, not a causation, it's difficult to truly say "Wayne drew attention away from the original track, which is why it fell on the charts", but with Wayne's reputation as a "rapper eater", and someone who skated over the hottest tracks during his 2005-2009 mixtape run, as well as the amount of places these tracks lost vs. how many they gained, it's not out of the realm of possiblity that Wayne caused some of this. Especially when you consider the song that gained the most from a Wayne remix was a track that Wayne featured on... I've also broken it down by mixtape, and by era.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2017-12-29 02:35:13</DATE>
    <TEXT>I spent the past few days having a look at the political content of Revival compared to the rest of the albums in Eminem's discography. Amazingly, "Untouchable" was more political than any of his prior albums. That track had 133 political lines, and his next highest album was Encore, with 104 political lines on the entire project. Here is the article: http://www.bensbigblog.com.au/2017/12/by-numbers-revival-was-only.html I also compared the political content of Revival to some of the mainstream political albums from the past 2 years. https://imgur.com/a/EXbyx Revival is 14.77% political, compared to 34.33% for ATCQ, 27.26% for 4:44, 24,46% for DAMN, and 17.95% for Untitled Unmastered. Em kind of compares in that sense, but when you consider the majority of Revival's political content is just 2 songs, it's not really a political record, nor are any in his discography. I also tried to find a correlation between critical reception and political content, but there isn't a strong link, and that's the same with sales. Does this surprise you? I thought Eminem was more of a political rapper than that...</TEXT>

Having immersed myself in nutrition for the past 10 years, I've learned a lot about the kind of food people tend to cook for themselves and their family. In my experience, the generations above me are less conscious of how often they eat poorly per week, and those below me seem to be even more intent on eating healthy than me. I live in Australia, so maybe it's different overseas? But I've observed my family and noticed the older generations think nothing of eating 7 unhealthy dinners in a row in a week. When I question them, they seem shocked to realise they ate sausages 3 times that week, homemade hamburgers, deep fried fish, and two meals at the local pub.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2018-01-11 01:23:21</DATE>
    <TEXT>I originally published this analysis in July 2017, but I've gotten much better at Excel and visuals since, and I've updated it for 2017, as well as adding new analysis. [Full analysis here](http://www.bensbigblog.com.au/2018/01/by-numbers-updated-how-often-does-lil.html), in which I answer these questions: - Did his obsession with pussy hurt his sales? - Did his obsession with pussy hurt his critical reception? - Did jail influence how much he raps about pussy? - Which of his collaborators raps about it the most? - Where did Wayne get his pussy obsession from? - Is his obsession waning? Will 2018 be the year he gives up the pussy? - Which year, song, and project features the most (and least) pussy mentions? I have a huge data-set, so ask me any questions or queries you may have!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>The Cloak is the most powerful Hallow by a long way, it negates the Elder Wand</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-01-19 01:01:52</DATE>
    <TEXT>A wizard who is invisible, and can cast spells from under the cloak, is near undefeatable. Defending against the killing curse is incredibly difficult, as Dumbledore showed during the duel at the Ministry. Imagine an invisible witch or wizard, walking around a battle unseen, picking people off with whatever curse or hex they want. How do you defend against a caster you can't see? Even the Elder Wand can't force the wearer to become visible. We know Dumbledore and Voldemort can become invisible without the cloak, but are they able to cast spells whilst invisible? Is the power diminished due to the strain of being invisible? Voldemort is invisible during the duel at the ministry, and Dumbledore is incredibly vigilant, but Voldemort does not curse Dumbledore while invisible, he tries to possess Harry. All three Hallows are meant to make the owner the master of death, but one could master death by using the invisibility cloak efficiently and intelligently. Am I missing something?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>How to Measure The Percentage Increase in Billboard Chart Positions, When A Lower Number is actually a higher number</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-01-23 10:11:16</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've got a dataset of billboard album chart positions before and after a certain event. All of the albums increase in chart position coinciding with this event, but an increase actually means a decrease in the numbers. For example, one artist's average chart position was 28.5, and then it improved to 3. How do I measure this increase? I tried measuring the increase from 3 to 28.5, which gives me 850%. I then tried to measure the decrease, and it was only 89%.. How can I best approach this?</TEXT>

It's no surprise that Camila recruited them to help with the sound of her record. They have proven track records, Frank Dukes is basically a super producer at this point. Their numbers are incredible.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>The Statistics Behind the Album of the Year Grammy, and the Numbers Showing How Often Hip-Hop Is Snubbed</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-01-27 12:28:10</DATE>
    <TEXT>Here is the full article and analysis: http://www.bensbigblog.com.au/2018/01/by-numbers-breakdown-of-every-grammys.html Two rap albums have been nominated for Album of the Year at this year's Grammys: DAMN and 4:44. In the past, Jay-Z, along with a lot of other artists, have boycotted the awards show to protest the way black artists have been treated by the awards. I decided to take a look at the statistics behind the Album of the Year category. Only 2 hip-hop albums have ever won it: The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill and Speakerboxx/The Love Below. The numbers actually show specific instances of hip-hop losing out to less successful and less critically aclaimed records. The worst snub was Kanye losing to Herbie Hancock in 2008. Graduation sold 2,000,000, and has 79 on metacritic. Herbie Hancock sold 100,000, with a 74. Furthermore, there have been so many incredible albums that werent even nominated. Licensed to Ill, It Takes A Nation of Millions To Hold Us Back, MBDTF, The Blueprint, Illmatic, The Chronic and 2001, X, 50 Cent, Ja Rule.</TEXT>

I also love putting oats in soup, it gives it such a better texture Last night I made an ice cream sandwhich with a brioche bun that i toasted. I sandwiched some icre cream inside, then poured magic shell over the buns. Put it in the fridge for 10 minutes and I had a brioche ice cream sandwhich encased in white chocolate.

    <TEXT>A friend of mine, I've known them for about 4 years but wouldn't say we're super close, makes dishes that are bordering on inedible. Too much salt, too much oil, scallops cooked to rubber-band texture, and this person often takes on difficult cooking tasks then falls well short. Especially desserts, like eclairs or baklava. I eat their food 2-3 times a week, and I am wondering if I should bother talking to them about it, or just cooking for myself on the nights we are under the same roof. Then again, if I do that, maybe they won't have an opportunity to improve? Or maybe my standards are just different?</TEXT>

    <DATE>2018-02-01 01:01:16</DATE>
    <TEXT>I spent some time digging deep into the meanings, connections, references and apparent motivations behind certain songs and bars, and what I found was an album full of hidden gems that Jay littered throughout the songs to give weight to his words, and experiences to back up his assertions and advice. http://www.bensbigblog.com.au/2017/07/444-connections-and-references-you-may.html It stung when he didn't win AOTY at The Grammys, but then the [statistics predicted it probably wouldn't anyway.](http://www.bensbigblog.com.au/2018/01/by-numbers-breakdown-of-every-grammys.html) I was upset at first, but I realised reducing something like 4:44 to a simple award was so debasing. There are so many different ways to consume 4:44, and I think it would actually be a fitting end to the "Blueprint" series. In 01 he, [Kanye, Bink and Just Blaze](http://www.bensbigblog.com.au/2017/04/bink-vs-just-blaze-who-was-true.html) laid a blueprint for a new rap sound. In 02 he tried to take that sound global, and he tried again in 09, but I think this record, 4:44, is a blueprint for life, for maturity, for growth. There are so many throwback references on the album that make you realise just how far Jay has come, and just how much growth is possible for all of us.</TEXT>

Before that album, he released 132 official beats, and only performed on 29 of them, 22%. Post College dropout, 295 songs released, and he performs on 179 of them, 60.65%.

    <TEXT>I've experienced both, and I believe the difference is mindset and control. A bulk is something you are in control of. I tend to really struggle to put on weight so I have to force myself to eat during periods where I am lifting a lot or I am under a lot of anxiety, because I tend to lose weight quickly. I've also gone through periods of severe binge-eating. I've used food as a way to numb depression and anxiety, and a way to basically punish myself via self-hatred. The difference in calories consumed between the two might not even be that great, but when I bulk, I eat mindfully, slowly, consciously, and I choose what I put in my mouth rationally and I can stop. When I binge, I eat rapidly, sometimes waiting for toast to cook is too long for me to wait between mouthfuls, so I eat peanut butter out of the jar while I wait. I also have much less control what I eat. I can't binge on vegetables, they don't engage the correct parts of the brain for what I am trying to achieve. It's ice cream, butter, cream, sugar etc. Everyone is different. It's not hard to bulk for some, it's hard to bulk for others. People tell me they wish they had a metabolism as fast as mine, but twice I've been hospitalised for being severely underweight during periods of depression, and I have to force-feed myself a LOT of food during times of intense anxiety to make sure I maintain. It's uncomfortable and very unpleasant</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So true. Think of what Kanye was going through back then. Dude was producing mainstream music for 7 whole years, getting massive placements, he was in the same room as legends, and he was the only one who saw how big he'd become as a rapper. There's a story, I think maybe Kareem Burke told it, but not 100% sure exactly who it was. They said to keep Kanye producing beats for Roc-A-Fella they signed him and supported his debut record, and Dame Dash said "if it's wack we can just throw Cam on every song and it'll be hot". He played Jesus Walks and got laughed out of the studio?! Imagine being laughed out of Bassline, with like Jay, Dame, State Property, Bleek etc, and STILL having the drive to go away and become a solo artist.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Rowling said on Pottermore:  gt; a wizard could catch anything a Muggle might catch, but he could cure all of it... Remus Lupin #8217;s affliction was a conscious reference to blood-borne diseases such as the HIV infection, with the attendant stigma. The potion Snape brews him is akin to the antiretroviral that will keep him from developing the  #8216;full-blown #8217; version of his illness It's hard to get a sense of whether witches and wizards can cure things like AIDS</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It depends I think on how you consume them. I eat the same thing every single day, because I don't really feel passionately about food, and I exercise a lot, so I need to eat a lot, it's just easier. I've discovered what's cheap and what works and what's healthy. But I don't eat anything to excess, so I might eat 2 tbs of peanut butter every single day for 2 years, and it will never get any less satiating. When I was binge eating heavily, it was the same. I'd eat 2 litres of ice cream a night for a year and it'd never get less satiating. Maybe because of the medication I was taking (Seroquel and Avanza). What you said about dairy though? I am kind of the opposite. Ive gone through cottage cheese and yogurt phases, and I seem to be able to tolerate them less the more often I eat them. At first I can eat half a tub of whatever really easy, but a month later I'm struggling with even the thought of it. Probably to do with dairy and maybe a slight intolerance on my part</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Everyone usually says "use Bob's Red Mill flour" to replace flour in a recipe without having to modify it. I think that's too expensive, so I usually use a mix that is 1 part starch (tapioca, corn starch) 2 parts flour (buckwheat, superfine rice flour etc) Wheat-free baked good have a totally different consistency when mixed, they a lot wetter, almost pourable. [Here](http://www.bensbigblog.com.au/2014/11/gluten-free-cottage-cheese-blueberry.html) is a recipe I made for wheat free muffins. I'd replace the honey in this recipe with mashed banana, and the cottage cheese with mashed banana too</TEXT>

I also counted up how many violent bars there have been on each of his projects, and I found a percentage for each individual album. The least violent album is actually Encore, Revival sits at 3rd least violent. I've broken down each album by which swear word is most popular, and I've got a graphic at the end that shows which swear words Em uses the most over the course of his career.</TEXT>

The previous two were both from the Fast and Furious series. I took a look at the most successful hip-hop soundtracks of all time, and the results were really interesting. - 21 hip-hop soundtracks hit the top 10 in the 90s - there were only 15 top 10s in the 2000s, and just 2 so far in the 2010s. 0 in the 80s - 8 Mile is *not* the highest selling hip-hop soundtrack in North America of all time - There is no correlation between how much a movie makes at the box office, and how well its soundtrack sells Any other questions hit me up!</TEXT>

Her first week numbers don't look great, but she spent 33 weeks in the Billboard 200 top 10 in 2016, 19 of those in the top 5</TEXT>

When they return to the school in search of the final horcrux, Dumbledore accompanies them, and the resistance begins, led by Dumbledore, while Harry and co go searching.

    <TEXT>I figured since the Untouchable lyric video is out, it'd be appropriate to look at the lyrical content. This is the first Eminem song on which every single line is devoted to a political or social message, and it continues the theme from his 2017 BET Cypher which took aim at Donald Trump. We tend to think of Eminem as a political rapper, but that hasn't always been the case. The numbers are amazing actually. I counted every line in each of his albums, and added up how many were devoted to a political or social issue, and came up with a "political percentage". Thanks to "Untouchable", Revival is his most political. Second? Encore... I've also counted up his most political songs and graphed them in the article.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Since Black Panther has been doing so well on the Billboard chart, I thought it would be interesting to look at the performance of soundtracks in general this decade. Here is the full analysis: http://www.bensbigblog.com.au/2018/02/by-numbers-soundtracks-have-increased.html The main figure is soundtracks have spent 950% longer at number 1 since Frozen than prior. If Frozen's 13 weeks at number are removed, it's still a 350% increase. I also tried to find a correlation between the success and popularity of a soundtrack and the success and popularity of the associated movie. That analysis is at the bottom.

Dumbledore had already developed a strong relationship with Harry prior to his actual death, and he was still focused on the final duel that they'd inevitably have. Lupin was always a realist, he showed that when he tried to join the trio and Harry sent him home with an admonishment. He was angry at first, but showed that he agreed with Harry's decision. Lupin's reluctance to be with Tonks was also a sign that he was a critical thinker, self-aware, and logical. His worry was that if they had a child, it'd be impacted. He tried to avoid a relationship despite his deep feelings for Tonks.</TEXT>

Just buy some very ripe bananas, mush them up to bascially a liquid, add whatever you want to them (Ive had success with protein powder, dried fruit, peanut butter, and chocolate), and freeze until hard. The texture is almost identical to regular ice cream, and because it's frozen, it taste just as sweet as ice cream!</TEXT>

The morning after these alleged crimes, a gleaming scarlet steam engine and carriages astounded the villagers of Hogsmeade (who had also not realised they had a railway station), while several bemused Muggle railway workers down in Crewe spent the rest of the year grappling with the uncomfortable feeling that they had mislaid something important. The Hogwarts Express underwent several magical modifications before the Ministry approved it for school use. Many pure-blood families were outraged at the idea of their children using Muggle transport, which they claimed was unsafe, insanitary and demeaning; however, as the Ministry decreed that students either rode the train or did not attend school, the objections were swiftly silenced.

    <TEXT>I feel like every country will be different on this. In Australia, saffron costs around $8 for 1 gram, so it's really difficult to justify using it for anything outside of very special occasions. Pine nuts cost around $50/kg, pistachio's $55/kg, so they just aren't a good value proposition. The other end of the scale is easier IMO. Salt and pepper, sugar, flour, rice, oats, sweet potato, all the basics that can be used either as a base to a meal or to enhance flavour.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2018-02-28 07:47:21</DATE>
    <TEXT>Way back in 2002, this is post-Ether, post-Takeover, post-Supa Ugly, and after Jay had apologised to Nas live on air, he had a 40 minute interview with Angie Martinez. He told Angie that he wanted to do a pay-per-view event with Nas at Madison Square Garden, in which they'd both perform separate sets, and then at the end, they'd battle each other with 3 prepared freestyles. The crowd would decide the winner, and both had to put up a million dollars. Jay said the ticket sales would go to charity. He also said this to Angie:  gt; We could go to the gym, put on some headgear... (take it to the ring?) Yeah. Three rounds. Quick, you know. They address it again [at 26:50.](https://youtu.be/Bf80XN22kBs?t=26m35s)  gt; Oh yeah don't forget the boxing thing afterwards. That's closed doors, nobody can get in there, just like men, two men, just do it, then we go our separate ways, peace. This was waaaay back in 2002, so it's possible by then, as [Dame Dash's boxing coach recently said, Jay was better.](http://thesource.com/2018/02/27/dame-dashs-boxing-coach-says-jay-z-fought-like-pee-wee-herman-got-waxed-watch/) But at first the boxing coach claimed Jay was like "Pee-wee Herman. At first he couldn't bust a grape". Jay isn't the most natural sportsperson. [This article](https://www.bensbigblog.com.au/2017/04/jay-z-playing-sport.html) details his at times highly ridiculed attempts to be athletic. Some gems from that article include Serena Williams saying that Jay was terrible at tennis, Jay telling an interview that running a mile every morning was difficult, and Nelly claiming in 2010 that he could beat Jay in a 1-on-1 basketball match.</TEXT>

It's usually targeted at listeners who value fast rapping and believe the faster the rapper, the more technical. I don't hear it used to criticise artists as often, maybe Hopsin. Jay's Death of Autotune wasn't really about the loss of rap technique, it was more a commentary on how many people were using autotune after T-Pain and Kanye. His claim was that autotune is totally fine when done well.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For everyone who is concerned about Eminem only being worth $100 million, these figures aren't the number in the bank account of the rapper.  gt; To compile the Forbes Five rankings, we follow the same procedures used to calculate our list of the world's billionaires (our annual update arrives Tuesday): valuing major assets, poring over financial documents, and speaking with analysts, attorneys, managers, other industry players and, in some cases, the moguls themselves. They can only work with publicly available numbers, unless the rapper legit hands over all their financial information, which is highly unlikely. You see that Birdman is no longer on the list, and he was on the list for a very long time. he didn't just suddenly lose a lot of money, on the contrary, he doesn't appear to be spending anywhere near enough money on his artists to get him dropped off the list. He fell off the list because a bunch of headlines about him owing people money. His worth was either greatly over-exaggerated, or, because of these headlines about him underpaying people, his worth is now underestimated. 50 Cent was on there until he filed for bankruptcy. People were confused, because Fif was worth over $100 million according to Forbes, then all of a sudden he was bankrupt. IMO the numbers are very shakey.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2018-03-05 12:13:54</DATE>
    <TEXT>I see a lot of criticism related to these three things: * Dumbledore taking Harry from Sirius and giving him to the Dursley's, rather than allowing him to be raised within the wizarding community * Dumbledore trusting Hagrid * Witches and Wizards not being taught conventional mathematics In the exchange between McGonagall and Dumbledore outside the Dursleys in chapter 1, McGonagall exclaims when Dumbledore tells her his intention of leaving Harry with the Dursleys "You can't mean the people who live here? Dumbledore \- you can't. I've been watching them all day. You couldn't find two people who are less like us". Dumbledore calmly explains that the fame may go to Harry's head, and it's better to be raised away from the limelight until he's ready for the truth. McGonagall agrees. She then questions his unwavering loyalty in Hagrid, by saying "I'm not saying his heart isn't in the right place, but you can't pretend he's not careless". Hagrid then turns up with Harry safe and sound. Dumbledore's unwavering trust in Hagrid isn't shared by McGonagall at all In the 4th chapter, Hagrid implies Harry knows nothing, to which Harry replies "I know math and stuff", to which Hagrid replies "about our world. Your world. My world. Yer parents world". The implication seems to be basic math is not important in the wizarding world.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My belief: At first, magic is instinctual. A child can perform magic without knowing how, or how to channel it, which means magic exists that hasn't been created, it exists outside of specific spells. The first spells were therefore created to channel magic in certain ways. Once the basic spells had been created and mastered, it because possible to combine spells. Clearly Sectumsempra borrows from the severing charm as well as a darker, more malicious spell like the Cruciatus curse. Snape need only tinker with wand movements, thoughts, and words to achieve his desired result, the way an inventor might create any hybrid product or material.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I understand your point, but putting numbers on the boards has been a huge part of hip\-hop for a long time. I agree that with so many artists going gold and platinum nowadays it feels like less of an achievement, but you have to remember, pre\-streaming people bought a CD and that was it. They might have listened to it 3000 times in the car, but that counts as a solitary sale. Now, if you play a song 3000 times that counts as two sales. Maybe it's more accurate these days?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Which recipe wastes/ruins a specific ingredient?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-03-07 11:44:24</DATE>
    <TEXT>I think adding nuts \(macadamias specifically\) to any dish already high in fat is a waste. Part of the appeal of the macadamia is the texture and mouthfeel, when you put it in chocolate, it's competing with both fat and sugar, I think it gets lost. Using real vanilla in anything with a lot of sugar. It's hard to distinguish the vanilla flavour on your palate when it's assaulted by 2 cups of brown sugar. High\-quality butter in baked goods. I find that butter contributes more to texture than to taste in things like cakes, so it's not a huge deal if you use cheap butter, I haven't noticed a difference yet. Thoughts?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Just in case anyone hasn't heard of that shop before, or they're planning on visiting your city and need some underground tips. In Sydney we have The Nut Roasters, a small shopfront in an industrial estate in Roselands. They supply a huge array of grocery stores throughout the state, but at the shop front, the nuts are freshly roasted, they're significantly cheaper, and they sell a nice array of groceries, and there is a fish shop and deli attached to the nut section. We also have Fourth Village Providore, a grocer with a well\-stocked, exotic cheese room, we have Coco chocolate, making handmade bars of high complexity, and Gourmet Life in Edgecliff which is the hook up for truffles and a lot of high\-end foods.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>how lucky is is that Paine was there?! Wow it could have gotten worse. I WILL get downvoted here. No\-one in this sub or seemingly in the world of cricket journalism knows what de Kock said to Warner. No\-one in this sub or seemingly the world of cricket journalism knows what Warner was saying to de Kock on the field, apart from the "sook" comment. I am baffled at the way everyone seems to have such a rock solid opinion on an incident in which they have basically no facts except from video of Warner being restrained. Please point me to an incident in which Warner has had to be restrained to avoid physical violence at any other stage in his career. he punched Joe Root because he felt Root was insulting the Muslim religion. He hasn't been in trouble for 2 years. Do you know David Warner personally? Do you spend a lot of time around him? Have you played cricket with him for an extended period of time? Because the people that have are defending him without compromise. If you have been following Australian cricket for the last decade, you'll realise players who act up or don't fit the culture get very limited chances in the Australian set up, let alone the test side. There is a reason why Shane Warne was never a long\-term Australian captain, and by that token, there is a reason why David Warner is considered a long\-term Australian captain in the short form of the game, and why the coach is behind him to remain vice captain. Now, if more facts do eventually surface that give a full idea of the incident, I will reassess, but at this point, I'm going to take the word of the players who were directly involved in the incident \- Tim Paine and David Warner.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Roc is independent, so that makes this process infinitely easier. An artist locked into a record contract is at the mercy of the label as to how their album is distributed. An artist has to build a fan base before they can pull off something like this, and the easiest way to build a fan base is to have a major label promote you. An artist without music on streaming services risks limiting their audience dramatically to those who can afford to pay this much for a single album \(I certainly can't\). This reduces your social media following, your crowd numbers, your venue size, and the money you get paid for appearances and guest spots. It's not always about how much you make on each album sale</TEXT>

If you start looking like your stripping off a lot of muscle at the same time, I'd adjust your intake, or specifically when you lift. For example, my metabolism is very fast, and I practise IF, so if I haven't eaten enough calories the night before, regardless of where I am in a bulk/cut cycle, my lifts will go down. Maybe you can work out after your biggest meal of the day, and use that energy to keep your lifts solid?</TEXT>

There is no such drug that can do all of that. Everyone is different, and the mix of medication must be tailored to the individual. A lot of people find marijuana greatly increases their anxiety, and it can't be used in patients with psychotic mental issues because it can make things significantly worse, even the first time they use it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Can't be too hard to avoid body contact with the batsman, bowlers from all playing nations have been doing it since cricket began. I want there to be passion in the game, we all do, but just look at how Steyn celebrates. No\-one would accuse him of being subdued, but then no\-one would accuse him of breaking the laws of the game or celebrating in a manner that doesn't fit the spirit of cricket. The fact that Faf is defending a player that now faces a 2 match suspension and will face even harsher penalties in the future if he continues to do this is puzzling. Seems unlikely they're going to change the law based on Faf's opinion, a law that's stood for a very long time.</TEXT>

Their side was full of high\-quality players like the Flowers, Heath Streak, Henry Alonga, Blinaut, Goodwin, the Strangs, Brandes. Obviously, what happened to Zimbabwe cricket was merely a symptom of a deep, disturbing, horrible problem in Zimbabwe during this time, but sometimes that's all the mainstream media shows. Would they be at their peak today, had this all not occurred? Who knows... But Andy Flower was one of the greatest wicket\-keeper batsmen of all time, and the side they had during the 97\-2002 period was full of great cricketers who would have had an opportunity to stay in Zimbabwe and work with the next generation.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>interresting. I've been doing an experiment for the past month. I used to eat a lot of sugar (I do a lot of cardio, so it's a fantastic energy source), and I switched to artificial sweetener. I find what you said to be very true, my brain at first thought it was more energy, but that effect was clearly just mental, because I didn't experience the spike in performance I get from normal sugar. Now, I can taste the sweetness but it isn't satiating in the way regular sugar is. And yeah, my performance definitely has dipped without that energy boost.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Skinny here. I can't recommend the major movements enough. Squats and deadlifts are essential. I started at a low weight to get my form right, then I worked within the 8\-12 rep range for 5 sets, and I started putting numbers on the scale. If you don't do anything else, do your compound exercises. As for food, it's difficult. I decided to really commit about 4 years ago, and I managed to put on about 40 pounds in 18 months. My advice to people who think they eat normally and are just naturally skinny is to double their calories. Peanut butter has saved me so much money, I go through a jar every 2 days. Find a calorie dense food that works for you. At first, you can't eat too much, only the size of your stomach should be limiting you. Find out what works and what doesn't, everyone is different.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That happened to me except I live in Australia, so it didn't cost me a cent. I had an MRI for double vision, I wore a HR monitor for a week to check my heart palpitations, I had a test in which my kidneys were flushed out because of the levels in my blood, I had a chest x-ray because of my shortness of breath, I even had my stomach checked for ulcers. In the end, it turned out I was in great health, I just suffered from severe, acute anxiety. So basically I wasn't in great health at all, and that was a decade ago, I've spent the last 10 years in therapy and on meds, and it's only in the past 8 months that my ridiculously hard work has paid off. If you do get the diagnosis that you're physically fine, I'd urge you to prioritise your mental health, and really work at it. It's the same as a physical illness or injury. If you break your arm, you wear a cast, no matter how annoying it is. Same with mental health.</TEXT>

Only just ahead of Country at 130. The increase in Rock's performance from 2016 was only 5 weeks.

    <TITLE>By The Numbers: The Game Name-Drops 1788 Times In His Entire Career (Studio Albums), Only 1 Song Doesn't Have a Name-Drop</TITLE>

    <TEXT>A few outlets have counted Game's name\-drops for individual albums, but this analysis includes every studio album by The Game, and goes a lot deeper than just a simple count. For example, from The Documentary until 1992 \(his 2016 album\), Game name\-drops at least once on 119 consecutive \(musical\) tracks. In fact, there is only a solitary Game song on a studio album without a name\-drop, and it didn't come until 2016. Also included: \- How many times he mentions Dr. Dre \- Top names he drops \- Comparison between his studio albums and other projects \- A comparison between The Game's name\-drops and those of his guests \- Which song has the most name\-drops of his entire career \- How many unique names he has dropped in his career If you have any questions about the dataset, please hit me up. If people like this article, I might publish a second one with a list of his most name\-laden songs, and look at how \(if at all\) his name\-dropping has impacted his success \(charts, sales, guest spots etc\).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>thanks for reading! I really came to The Game late, but in the last 12 months I've been listening to his discography, and I think he's really underrated as a lyricist. However, going through these songs just by the lyrics, it does get way too much, especially Dr. Dre! The amount of songs he mentions him on consecutively is just too much IMO.</TEXT>

I am not  #8216;comfortably satisfied #8217; that Mr Rabada intended to make contact and I therefore find him not guilty of the charge under 2.2.7. Do they have new footage?

I think it's a real turning point in music, where independent artists have more of a voice and an ability to blow up.

Just as we had some amazing albums in the 80s, 90s and 2000s, we've had some amazing ones in the 2010s. MBDTF, TPAB, GKMC, Carrie  amp; Lowell, Reflektor, so many</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've always believed Beyonc #233; was pivotal in turning Jay\-Z from a hyper\-masculine self\-professed player \("Big Pimpin'", "I Just Wanna Love U \(Give It To Me\)", "Jigga What, Jigga Who", "Is That Yo Bitch", countless others\) to someone who actually feels the need to apologise for infidelity. So I went through every Jay\-Z song and guest spot, and counted every single time he explicitly mentions Beyonc #233;, and the nature of that reference. Was it sexual? Family? A punchline? Etc. What resulted was a map of Jay's maturation, aligned with specific parts and milestones in their relationship. If you have any questions hit me up, I am happy to answer!</TEXT>

So I went through every Jay\-Z song and guest spot, and counted every time he explicitly mentions Beyonc #233;, and the nature of that reference. Was it sexual? Family? A punchline? Etc. What resulted was a map of Jay's maturation, aligned with specific parts and milestones in their relationship. If you have any questions hit me up, I am happy to answer!

    <TEXT>thank you! I found that fascinating actually, in fact, for all of Jay's early hyper-masculine and at times misogynistic lyrics, he was rarely super explicit, but once he and Bey were married he really doubled down on it. Alongside a huge increase in his mentions of family! Weird dichotomy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>the word is that it was around 05\-08, that it occurred before they were married. Both their music aligns with this. Beyonce's 2006 album B'Day is littered with lines about cheating, and Jay released Lost One, which had a verse about losing a girlfriend, and Trouble, which had the line "If my hand in the cookie jar know one thing, Imma take the cookie, not leave my ring"</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I mean, it's always possible. But, I think there is a bar on 4:44 that points to the infidelity occurring prior to 2012:"Took for my child to be born, seen through a woman's eyes" Blue was born January 2012. Concieved in 2011. Jay dropped "Lost One" and "Trouble" in 2006, both had references to losing a woman and infidelity. Lemonade was likely Beyonce's first time explicitly speaking of it, but on B'Day 2006, her lyrics are notably different from her debut album, which was very love-focused, and dropped in 2003, when Jay and Bey got together. We can't be certain, but signs point to the infidelity occurring during that 05-08 period</TEXT>

She said the manager called her 3 days prior to her first shift, and when my friend said she was enthused to cook for nursing home residents, the manager said, quite casually, "Oh don't get too excited, they can barely taste anything.

    <TEXT>I work from home, and I prefer it so much. I can have 3 monitors set up, and a lot of the work I do is quite simple data collection, requiring no real mental gymnastics, so the ability to listen to music is so helpful, keeps me sane.

I also like the freedom of working at home, it feels like I am choosing to work, rather than being forced to work</TEXT>

I kept the definition via increased strength and atrophy, but I was on a lean bulk, and it took 18 months, not a couple of months...</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I remember, the nas/Jay beef actually popped off after Bleek went at Nas on "Mind Right", then Nas went at the whole Roc on a freestyle, Jay debuted Takeover at Summer Jam without the Nas verses on the end, then he went into the studio and laid the last two verses, and released them on The Blueprint. Nas then went at Hov on Ether, Hov clapped back with Supa Ugly, Hov went back at Nas on Blueprint 2 (the track), and it petered out. Nas said "Eminem killed you on your own shit" on "Ether", which was released after "Takeover", which went at Nas. Eminem is an iconic rapper, 50 Cent sold a ridiculous amount of records. DMX is iconic, Lauryn Hill is iconic, Outkast is iconic. In 1998 Jay went up against them and won the Grammy for best rap album. I figure it's a pretty common thing that Jay-Z is an icon and a great lyricist. I don't know that it's even debatable at this point...</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Why is gluten-free baking so variable?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-05-20 13:12:56</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've been baking gluten free for about 8 years now, my sister is celiac and I used to bake often, and never with normal flour. I just assumed baking was at times a little temperamental. I rarely got the same result twice, until I began baking with regular flour. The consistency is amazing, I can follow a recipe and get the same result almost every time. Not with GF baking. Some days they rise, some they fall. Some they crumb, others they crust. Some days they're moist and dense, others they are dry and flaky. I could post this in the baking or GF sub, but I wonder if anyone in this has experienced this variability, and maybe overcome it, or at least understood it?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is great advice thank you. I never trusted Bob's because of how outrageously expensive it has been in Australia, I usually buy the flour separately and put them together myself. I do weigh my ingredients but not all the time. AND this is interesting to me, resting the dough. I've never rested dough, I've only left it to rise... I didn't know you had to, so thank you :)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I ran the numbers on every Kanye album rollout, here is what I learned (and a prediction on the new album)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-05-30 22:53:32</DATE>
    <TEXT>Every album in Kanye West #8217;s discography has a story attached to it, a narrative or a legend that has emerged since it was released. It #8217;s tempting to say listeners and critics assign these legacies to Kanye #8217;s albums as they age, but the raw data tells a different story:: **Kanye strategically controls the narrative around every one of his albums, and he begins the process around 60 weeks prior to release date.** I gathered data from Kanye #8217;s entire discography and back catalogue, including: * Every song he has ever produced * Every guest spot he #8217;s delivered * Every lead song he #8217;s released I analysed the period 60 weeks prior to each album, \(aka when Kanye #8217;s in  #8220;Album Mode #8221;\) to either prove or disprove a commonly held belief for each album. In my research, I found that Kanye is meticulous in his preparation. ## What the Data says about each of Kanye #8217;s Albums [***The College Dropout***](https://centralsauce.com/college-dropout-kanye-west)**: Kanye wasn #8217;t taken seriously or given opportunity as a rapper until his debut album.** **Prior to** ***The College Dropout:*** * Kanye performed the fewest guest spots * Kanye delivered the fewest words * Kanye delivered the fewest hooks * 77% of Kanye #8217;s output prior to the album is devoted to production, the most [***Late Registration***](https://centralsauce.com/late-registration-kanye-west)**: The year Kanye came back to remind everyone he wasn #8217;t just a great rapper, he was instrumental in crafting the sound of mainstream hip\-hop during the early 2000s.** **Prior to** ***Late Registration:*** * Kanye released the most beats than prior to any other album * Kanye produced the most singles of any album cycle * He gave more beats away \(37\) than any other album * He produced for 21 separate labels, his most [***Graduation***](https://centralsauce.com/graduation-kanye-west)**: Kanye transcended rap and became a rock star** * Ye sold more copies of his promotion singles \(10,000 via  #8220;Stronger #8221; and  #8220;Can #8217;t Tell Me Nothing #8221;\) than at any other point in his career * He went on his longest world tour \(2006\-2008, the most shows he has ever played outside of the U.S. \) * *Graduation* charted in the top 10 in 14 different countries, a career high \(Yeezus is second with 11\) [***808s  amp; Heartbreak***](https://centralsauce.com/808s-heartbreak-kanye-west)**: Kanye took the biggest risk of his career on** ***808s*** * Kanye used just 3 samples used on *808s*, making it the least sample\-reliant project of Kanye #8217;s career \(next lowest is 18 samples on *Yeezus*\) * Kanye had his lowest output as a producer prior to the album * 10 tracks that Kanye appeared on or released before the album were R amp;B, a career high \(*Yeezus* and* Graduatio*n each only had 3\) * The *808s* era is the first time Kanye used auto tune on his lead vocals * A whopping 88.3% of Kanye #8217;s vocals on *808*s utilize autotune [***My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy***](https://centralsauce.com/mbdtf-kanye-west)**: Kanye #8217;s Ascent to the Top of Mainstream Rap** * Kanye performed more words and more bars prior to *MBDTF* than any other album * More Kanye beats were released with Kanye as a guest artist than at any other point in his career * There isn #8217;t a a single song prior to *MBDTF* in which Kanye performs only a hook with no rapping * 6 of Kanye #8217;s guest spots before the album were Pop, making it his most Pop\-heavy album cycle by far [***Yeezus***](https://centralsauce.com/yeezus-kanye-west)**: Kanye #8217;s least accessible album \(the anti\-*****MBDTF*****\)** * Fewest bars Kanye has ever dropped before an album * Fewest hooks Kanye has ever delivered \(as lead artist\) before an album \(43 words devoted to hooks\) * Kanye produced the fewest tracks for guest artists ever prior to *Yeezus* * He produced for just 4 different artists, and 6 separate labels, his lowest [***The Life of Pablo***](https://centralsauce.com/life-of-pablo-kanye-west)**: Kanye #8217;s most confusing album** The legacy of *TLOP* is yet to be felt, but the data has a hard time figuring out what that feeling will look like. * 44 samples were used on the album, the most for any Kanye album * The album is mid\-range when considering stats like bars prior to album \(3rd\), 31 tracks produced \(4th\), Singles produced \(3rd\), Kanye not rapping on his own beats \(5th\) * Kanye released more album tracks prior to *TLOP* * Ye produced more pop songs \(6\) prior * *TLOP #8217;*s singles performed the worst on the Hot 100 than any other Ye release **Kanye #8217;s 2018 Album: What do the numbers say?** The follow up to *The Life of Pablo* is due to drop this Friday, and Kanye #8217;s stats in the past 60 weeks don #8217;t give a lot of clues as to the content or sound. He #8217;s produced 9 tracks for other artists, and 2 for himself. He has dropped 2 loosies,  #8220;Lift Yourself #8221; and  #8220;Ye Vs. The People #8221;. He featured on Travis Scott #8217;s  #8220;Watch #8221;, which hit 16 on the Hot 100, his next best was 48 with his production credit on  #8220;BBO #8221; by Migos. No Kanye rollout has tracked a similar path. With the promise of 7 songs, and the above statistics, it seems this project could be an odd mix between *Yeezus* and *808s*. Both projects found Kanye withdrawn and reserved \(musically\) prior to their release. One thing is for certain: it will make sense 10\-15 years from now. If you #8217;re interested in getting a little deeper into the analysis, you can find my [full write ups w/ complete data on each of Kanye #8217;s albums here](https://centralsauce.com/tag/yeezy-season).

    <TEXT>Yeah I actually did an article on that, and traced the decline of New York rap to that very moment. It was a pivotal point. But I think Kanye transcended rap on that album, Graduation. Commercially, it was so successful. I felt like he was a little left of centre during this period though, that mainstream rap was still Jay-Z/Eminem/50 Cent, traditional. And Kanye wasn't making traditional rap albums, not until MBDTF</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I ran the numbers on the rollout for every single Kanye solo album, here is what I learned (and what it might mean for the new album)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-06-01 00:29:56</DATE>
    <TEXT>I had this on r/hiphopheads yesterday, I wanted everyone on hear to see it if you missed it :\) Every album in Kanye West #8217;s discography has a story attached to it, a narrative or a legend that has emerged since it was released. It #8217;s tempting to say listeners and critics assign these legacies to Kanye #8217;s albums as they age, but the raw data tells a different story::**Kanye strategically controls the narrative around every one of his albums, and he begins the process around 60 weeks prior to release date.**I gathered data from Kanye #8217;s entire discography and back catalogue, including: * Every song he has ever produced * Every guest spot he #8217;s delivered * Every lead song he #8217;s released I analysed the period 60 weeks prior to each album, \(aka when Kanye #8217;s in  #8220;Album Mode #8221;\) to either prove or disprove a commonly held belief for each album. In my research, I found that Kanye is meticulous in his preparation. ## What the Data says about each of Kanye #8217;s Albums [***The College Dropout***](https://centralsauce.com/college-dropout-kanye-west)**: Kanye wasn #8217;t taken seriously or given opportunity as a rapper until his debut album.Prior to** ***The College Dropout:*** * Kanye performed the fewest guest spots * Kanye delivered the fewest words * Kanye delivered the fewest hooks * 77% of Kanye #8217;s output prior to the album is devoted to production, the most [***Late Registration***](https://centralsauce.com/late-registration-kanye-west)**: The year Kanye came back to remind everyone he wasn #8217;t just a great rapper, he was instrumental in crafting the sound of mainstream hip\-hop during the early 2000s.Prior to** ***Late Registration:*** * Kanye released the most beats than prior to any other album * Kanye produced the most singles of any album cycle * He gave more beats away \(37\) than any other album * He produced for 21 separate labels, his most [***Graduation***](https://centralsauce.com/graduation-kanye-west)**: Kanye transcended rap and became a rock star** * Ye sold more copies of his promotion singles \(10,000 via  #8220;Stronger #8221; and  #8220;Can #8217;t Tell Me Nothing #8221;\) than at any other point in his career * He went on his longest world tour \(2006\-2008, the most shows he has ever played outside of the U.S. \) * *Graduation* charted in the top 10 in 14 different countries, a career high \(Yeezus is second with 11\) [***808s  amp; Heartbreak***](https://centralsauce.com/808s-heartbreak-kanye-west)**: Kanye took the biggest risk of his career on** ***808s*** * Kanye used just 3 samples used on *808s*, making it the least sample\-reliant project of Kanye #8217;s career \(next lowest is 18 samples on *Yeezus*\) * Kanye had his lowest output as a producer prior to the album * 10 tracks that Kanye appeared on or released before the album were R amp;B, a career high \(*Yeezus* and\* Graduatio\*n each only had 3\) * The *808s* era is the first time Kanye used auto tune on his lead vocals * A whopping 88.3% of Kanye #8217;s vocals on *808*s utilize autotune [***My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy***](https://centralsauce.com/mbdtf-kanye-west)**: Kanye #8217;s Ascent to the Top of Mainstream Rap** * Kanye performed more words and more bars prior to *MBDTF* than any other album * More Kanye beats were released with Kanye as a guest artist than at any other point in his career * There isn #8217;t a a single song prior to *MBDTF* in which Kanye performs only a hook with no rapping * 6 of Kanye #8217;s guest spots before the album were Pop, making it his most Pop\-heavy album cycle by far [***Yeezus***](https://centralsauce.com/yeezus-kanye-west)**: Kanye #8217;s least accessible album \(the anti\-*****MBDTF*****\)** * Fewest bars Kanye has ever dropped before an album * Fewest hooks Kanye has ever delivered \(as lead artist\) before an album \(43 words devoted to hooks\) * Kanye produced the fewest tracks for guest artists ever prior to *Yeezus* * He produced for just 4 different artists, and 6 separate labels, his lowest [***The Life of Pablo***](https://centralsauce.com/life-of-pablo-kanye-west)**: Kanye #8217;s most confusing album**The legacy of *TLOP* is yet to be felt, but the data has a hard time figuring outwhat that feeling will look like. * 44 samples were used on the album, the most for any Kanye album * The album is mid\-range when considering stats like bars prior to album \(3rd\), 31 tracks produced \(4th\), Singles produced \(3rd\), Kanye not rapping on his own beats \(5th\) * Kanye released more album tracks prior to *TLOP* * Ye produced more pop songs \(6\) prior * \*TLOP #8217;\*s singles performed the worst on the Hot 100 than any other Ye release **Kanye #8217;s 2018 Album: What do the numbers say?**The follow up to *The Life of Pablo* is due to drop this Friday, and Kanye #8217;s stats in the past 60 weeks don #8217;t give a lot of clues as to the content or sound. He #8217;s produced 9 tracks for other artists, and 2 for himself. He has dropped 2 loosies,  #8220;Lift Yourself #8221; and  #8220;Ye Vs. The People #8221;. He featured on Travis Scott #8217;s  #8220;Watch #8221;, which hit 16 on the Hot 100, his next best was 48 with his production credit on  #8220;BBO #8221; by Migos.No Kanye rollout has tracked a similar path. With the promise of 7 songs, and the above statistics, it seems this project could be an odd mix between *Yeezus* and *808s*. Both projects found Kanye withdrawn and reserved \(musically\) prior to their release.One thing is for certain: it will make sense 10\-15 years from now.If you #8217;re interested in getting a little deeper into the analysis, you can find my [full write ups w/ complete data on each of Kanye #8217;s albums here](https://centralsauce.com/tag/yeezy-season).

    <TEXT>This article is about mainstream rap. I agree with you on Lil B, Z-Ro, there are loads, Aesop Rock, Buck 65, Sage Francis, there is plenty of rap talking about mental illness. But never for this long. Eminem raps about it a lot, but his bars are so cartoonishly violent in his early career, you get a song like "Superman" near songs like "Sing for the Moment", or "Square Dance" next to "Cleaning Out My Closet". His later career, especially Relapse, has some incredible points, like "Beautiful" or "Deja Vu", yet most of Relapse he is rapping about being a serial killer... My only point is this, "ye" is the first superstar (and Cudi is great, but he isn't on the same level as Kanye, Jay-Z, Eminem in terms of popularity and reach) to make an album that shows solidarity with sufferers, that speaks to them on their level, and maintains it for an entire project. Not just a song or a verse hidden in an album cut.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>By The Numbers: Why "ye" is already a classic to sufferers of mental illness</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-06-14 23:42:35</DATE>
    <TEXT>Full article: [https://centralsauce.com/kanye-west-mental-illness](https://centralsauce.com/kanye-west-mental-illness) 18.3% of "ye" is devoted to mental illness. There are 71 total references, diving deep into depression, anxiety, suicide, addiction, and bipolar disorder. The way Kanye speaks on mental illness on this record is raw, open, and honest. Albums about mental illness exist on the periphery of the mainstream, but Kanye will likely go down as the most influential hip-hop artist of all time. For him to create an album like this? Clearly, it's not for sales, for awards, for critical acclaim. It's for the people that always get forgotten, glossed over, ostrasized. I really just want to thank Kanye, from the bottom of my heart and soul. You #8217;ve created a piece of art that I can show people, easily digestible and understood, that goes some way to explaining what happens inside our minds and hearts during this mental health battle. An album that now exists, and can never be taken away, as proof that we are not alone, we aren #8217;t to be feared, and proof we can speak out, that we re justified in this fight, that we aren #8217;t alone on this path. This is bravery.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>These 5 projects were well produced, I think this is Kanye's greatest collective achievement as a producer for other artists since *Be*. I don't think we will hear anything quite as in-depth or lush from any other producer, and this is why I love Kanye. He helped create the trap wave we hear now, the muted 808s, and then with Yeezus he introduced these hard, grinding beats. Yet in 2018, when this sound is absolutely everywhere (and all over Scorpion), he delivers something completely different, harking back to a time period in rap but updating it. Nas on DAYTONA's beats though... wow.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've got those Pink Friday stats I will try and update the article with them at the bottom I think the influence of Cardi B can't be discounted. Nicki was basically in a lane of her own (her own HOV lane) for so long, no Cardi comes along with 94% rap and picks up number 1 singles and her album is well-liked and sells well. Nicki, I think, got confused. She pushed her album back 2 months, that's a big deal. She claimed perfectionism, but the way it's come out, the lack of singing (it's still there but significantly less), points to her not really certain what direction to go in next. I think she will drop something relatively soon, maybe within 12 months, whilst Cardi is still a little occupied elsewhere. I think she could go even further rap, because the reviews I am reading all praise her rapping on this. And I have an inkling she reads reviews...</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't know what her path is, I think it's very confused at the moment. I've seen mixed reviews for QUEEN thus far, slightly lower than Pinkprint. Her sales are lower because her lack of chart presence prior to the album. A lot of pop artists never make it anywhere near this far. To be in her 8th year and 4th album, it's unsurprising she isn't doing insane numbers. Look at an artist like Katy Perry who is also losing relevance Nick also unfortunately burnt a lot of her rap fans by continuing down the pop route, and her run of feature verses in the past 12 months has been really really patchy. She has dropped some heat but also some true duds, and her flow was basically just normal and then random double time. I think she is losing relevance as most artists do if they aren't staying on top of their branding and their focus and sound.</TEXT>

Budden broke it all down on his podcast, Drake seems pretty pissed off with kanye Pusha's beef is with Cash Money, Drake is signed to Cash Money. It's clearly not a huge issue between Drake and Pusha, but the problems seem to stem from Kanye. The story is, Kanye leaked the information about Adidon to Pusha after Drake revealed them at a recording session in March. So it's pretty fair for Drake to be angry at Kanye in this whole thing, if that story is true</TEXT>

It's also, by far, her lowest first week I wonder where Nicki will go after this? Will she go back to pop now? I think the problem is, she has created fan bases in both genres, and the more she distances herself from pop, the less her pop fans are going to buy</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think Eminem aimed at MGK as a way to highlight his own influence, the way he paved and created a path for other white rappers to follow and gain success via.  #8203; I am not sure why he feels the need to diss him though... I think Eminem is trying to remind people that he was actually influential, and that he can't be grouped with the other white rappers in the game. It's so weird though, he really doesn't need to. And the more energy and time he wastes on dissing people who are actually below him, the further towards their level he descends</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Eminem dissing Budden could be so risky... I feel like Budden is one of the only people Eminem has ever dissed that might have more than just superficial bars. Budden has been around through a lot of Eminem's later career, I am sure he has some stuff in the cut</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah a few major hits for sure, but I mean a run where an artist is at the pinnacle of the commercial culture. Em was 1999-2004, then he took some time off. 50 Cent, Ja Rule, DMX, all these artists had a run</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A diss is a little different to a track like "Normal", in my opinion. A diss is a bar aimed at another rapper, criticising them based on something to do with their music or their persona A track about a relationship gone bad isn't, in my opinion, a diss, unless it pertains to a specific person (AKA when Em was dissing Mariah earlier in the century)</TEXT>
