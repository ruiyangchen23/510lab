    <TITLE>Recommendations for a rowdy dog with a bossy/bullying play style?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2015-06-16 06:35:31</DATE>
    <TEXT>My [dog] (http://imgur.com/a/iOEuY), a one year old cattle dog/other herding breeds/pit (assumed) is generally a submissive little goober with other dogs (her first reaction when meeting any new dog is to tuck her tail, avert her gaze, and roll over) but she has a bullying play style when she gets comfortable with another dog. The cattle dog in her seems to give her an almost uncontrollable urge to pursue other dogs when they're chasing (and she's almost always faster) and grab them by the collar/neck, and the pit in her (I think) gives her a tendency to be very vocal and physical. She often tosses the other dog to the ground and pins them there by keeping her mouth around their neck (not biting down, just holding) or using her body as a block. It has never escalated into true aggression and in fact if a dog becomes reactive she quickly gets submissive and slinks away, but it's a big problem since a lot of my friends have small dogs and we love to go to the park/beach/hikes with our dogs. This is only a problem when she's in chase mode -- if she's being chased or playing other games, she's generally very polite. She's very fast and strong for her size though (40 pounds) so I often wind up leashing her in open spaces with other dogs even though she badly wants to run and play is trained to recall quite well when not in chase mode. Other bossy/bullying behavior she demonstrates is barking loudly at dogs to get them to play/chase, knocking them over, and sitting/leaning on them. (Not all at once though luckily!) She seems to now know this is inappropriate behavior b/c if I can catch her before she makes contact with a sharp verbal warning she backs off. If she's got a dog pinned, however, I have no chance. What I usually do at this point is leash her (although catching her can be a problem when she's wound up and thinks everything is a game), allow her to settle, then give her one more chance as long as everyone is ok with that  #8211; if she does it again, we leave the park/beach/whatever. Any suggestions beyond what I'm doing? Is this something she'll grow out of? Do I need to just keep her leashed around other dogs? She needs quite a bit of exercise to stay sane so this would be hard on us both if that's the solution. I truly don't believe this is an aggression issue but more of a bossy/bullying/competitive play thing, but it's pretty unacceptable behavior to me. Any help welcomed!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I know I don't need a wedding planner. But do I need a day-of coordinator?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-03-15 06:05:45</DATE>
    <TEXT>The wedding will be outdoors at a friend's property in California, very casual, BBQ/camping wedding with live music. We're doing pretty much everything on the cheap and community-style (with a lot of help from family + friends) and we are doing all the planning ourselves, so thinking of hiring a coordinator seems...unnecessary. Yet, most the common advice I've been hearing is to hire a day-of-coordinator. (I'm not not quite sure what the value add is.) Any input? We're thinking 150 people.</TEXT>

Guests will be a combination of friends our age (who are used to a more rustic setting/camping) and family/our parents friends who are likely not. We're leaning toward the trailer but it's hard to stomach it being almost 1/5 of our budget!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You guys have been so helpful with other posts I thought I'd ask the experts on this one. I am looking for recommendations for low cost tables (and seating) for dinner for a ranch wedding. Dinner is going to be family style, and long tables/seated all together as much as possible is what we're going for. I'd love to have the long wooden farm tables but unfortunately the rental cost is too high. We could just rent the cheaper folding tables and chairs but it's not quite the farm look we're going for, and setting them up on dirt isn't ideal (tiny legs, not table). Approx. 150 guests, plus kids. *Standing ceremony so we won't have chairs to repurpose.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't want a traditional wedding dress, so I always thought shopping would be a breeze. I'd buy something off the rack, get a few alterations, and call it a day. Problem is, I'm not finding anything I love that also looks great on. The sky is really the limit since I don't want a white ballgown type dress but I'm just not able to find something I adore. A few on Etsy look amazing but they don't have a return policy so it's a real leap of faith and I'm not prepared to drop all that dough and not love the dress. I'm finding the dresses that I do love are out of my price point (I'd like to stay under $1k, although for something spectacular I can go higher.) I also need to decide quickly so we can get my guy's outfit planned. There are also so many other things to do! Any tips for an indecisive bride? Should I just get any old thing and go with it?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't much like wedding cake (or the price tag that goes along with it) and since there are so many great desserts out there, I figured we could pretty much do whatever we wanted. Have you guys seen any ideas out there you particularly liked? I'm tentatively thinking of going with a pie table (goes with the rustic ranch wedding vibe), but my only concern is that it might get a little bit messy at the end of the night. Maybe that's okay. Other ideas I had were fancy donuts, and a cake made out of rice krispy treats (I loooooove rice krispy treats!). The wedding will be outside at a ranch, pretty rustic, kind of Mexican themed (but not entirely), in early October. I'd love to find something that was fun, easy to do, not crazy messy or crazy expensive. (As much as I love the idea of 200 mini pies, I don't want dessert to be a major line item in the wedding budget.) Thank you in advance for any ideas!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[HELP] How to communicate to my protective dog that 'everything is ok?' when she's growling/being protective?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-06-29 22:38:42</DATE>
    <TEXT>My pup (2y F herding/bully mix) is naturally protective (of the home/car, etc.) and wary of strangers. I work from home most days so she's constantly growling/rumbling and giving small warning barks when people are walking or making noises outside, even my neighbors/tenants, people that she knows well. How can I let her know that all's well and she can stop the rumbling and checking out the front door? I am hesitant to tell her NO (although sometimes I do) because I know that she's communicating a warning which shouldn't be punished. The behavior is not particularly aggressive, but it's annoying on a constant basis nonetheless. Edit: I should add that I *can* usually get her to stop by calling her over and treating her, but I feel like I'm rewarding the behavior. What I've been doing is calling her to me and asking for a simple set of commands (to distract her), then treating. It works in the moment but she just goes back to it when she goes back to her bed. It also requires me to stop my work every 10 minutes or so which is fairly distracting. What I'd love is a command that works, like *hush*. (Wishful thinking, I'm sure.)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Kids at a wedding: what to do with them at night?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-07-06 01:57:07</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi all, we don't have kids but are allowing kids at our wedding this Fall, so are hoping for some insight. We're having an overnight camping wedding and are opening up the invitation to people's kids if they choose to bring them. Not everyone is camping (there are hotels nearby) but about half the guests are. Invites just went out, and one set of parents who we know quite well asked if they could bring their buddies camping to watch the kids so they could stay up and party and get some adult time. These are good friends so I don't have a problem telling them no, but I'm a little taken aback. This is definitely a more casual type wedding so it's not totally out of the question but of course we're still paying her head and would rather have people we know and love at our wedding for obvious reasons. (There are people we didn't invite that I'd much rather have than friends of friends.) My FH says we should let them, and be prepared for more people to ask the same, or ask if they can bring nannies, and we should have our answer prepared. Is bringing your own childcare expected at kid-friendly weddings? We'd planned on hiring babysitters during the day and evening but didn't expect they'd need to stay the night. I kind of feel like if you choose to bring kids, that one of the parents just needs to suck it up and go to bed with them when it's kid bedtime. My FH thinks we need to just let everyone bring a nanny/friend who wants to, to watch their kids. I'm kind of flabbergasted this is even a thing but if course want to be accommodating.

There is a very loose Mexican (Oaxacan) vibe running through the aesthetic from a recent extended trip we took.

Here's the critical information: outdoor Fall wedding in Northern California (this is our "Indian summer" so it will be quite warm); colors of surrounding nature will be golden-hue, [dried grass] (https://pixabay.com/static/uploads/photo/2015/03/17/14/05/dry-677777_960_720.jpg) and dark green of the [redwoods] (http://www.redwoods.info/photos%5C505P3HIGH%20ROCK%20TOP%202%20JUNE%202%2007.JPG); only decorations we have are [papel picado] (http://media.theknot.com/ImageStage/Objects/0003/0017039/large_image.jpg) and hammered metal art like [this] (https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/51/6c/43/516c43356c800cd1ac9121b22f1b983b.jpg) from our recent trip to Oaxaca; we have a lot of hay bales for seating so are thinking of getting a bunch of Mexican blankets to cover them (although we could also do burlap coffee bags); we've asked guests to wear gold and white to the ceremony (I know, a little unorthodox) and afterparty; we're not doing flowers other than the paper flowers, unless we buy some bunches of local flowers from our friend's farm on the way up. Don't know what the colors of those would be but they will be simple; this is a weekend long camping wedding. We hate the idea of matchy-matchy wedding colors but my future mother-in-law does need some direction on the flower making. She wanted to make white and gold flowers (the only "theme" she could attach herself to from my description) but I think with the dried grass it will just be blah and we could use a little color pop. I like the idea of brightly colored Mexican-style paper flowers (think more Frida and Diego than Cinco de Mayo) but am a little worried it will look like a kid's birthday party. I found [this image] (http://www.refinery29.com/100-layer-cake/82#slide-3) of paper flowers on 100 Layer Cake and liked it quite a bit, but not sure it will go with the Mexican fiesta flags...I really have the worst natural sense of style so would love a little help if anyone with a good sense of natural aesthetic has any ideas. (I know what color to make the paper flowers is really not a big decision but I'm so stuck!)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>How much do we tip the caterer??</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-07-28 06:44:19</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm seeing things all over the map online, from 15% of total, 20% of total (which is actually a big difference with a big bill), $200, $500, and $1 or $2 per guest. These are vastly different amounts. What's the best practice? If it matters, this is a single person catering operation  #8211; he owns the business and will have just a few staff helping. We're getting a great deal and he's been a pleasure to work with so far, so we'd definitely like to give a good tip. And what should we do, just tip him and he can tip out his staff? Or tip them all separately?</TEXT>

There are actually two venues since we're hosting a brunch at an Airbnb on Sunday (although maybe Airbnb has insurance, we'll see). We need to get our own insurance. Progressive Event Insurance was the first thing that came up on a Google search but wanted to see if anyone has experience with this and could provide a recommendation.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>How to deal with glasses at an outdoor wedding venue?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-08-07 07:11:43</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi friends, I'm having an outdoor wedding at a ranch and am totally stumped about how to deal with glasses. We're having a caterer but they're only dealing with food, not rentals. My original idea was to give everyone a labeled mason jar to hang onto for the night but I think realistically, people will be leaving them everywhere and since we're out at a ranch, there's no one to wash them and bring them out again. I've heard that a rule of thumb for rentals is 4-5 glasses per person for a drinking crowd (which we are). But that's going to be 1000 glasses...which seems crazy, especially since we have a two day wedding and would need to do that twice. Any other outdoor wedding brides or grooms out there that have this figured out?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Selecting the wine for our wedding in 6 weeks and it was suggested since we're having a late summer outdoor wedding that we choose a nice ros #233; instead of a white. Seems festive, and I don't have really strong opinions on wine choice (my mom is handling it and she's more of a wine drinker anyway). As not much of a wine-drinker, could use a little guidance. Are ros #233; and white functionally interchangeable in a party setting, or will some people not want to drink ros #233; and be asking for white? (I know people can be rather particular about wine preferences.) Further, is Chardonnay or Sauvignon Blanc generally preferred by people? We're in Northern California, if that makes a difference.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[Help] Looking for advice on what to do with dog on extended honeymoon</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-11-04 05:41:05</DATE>
    <TEXT>Let me start off by saying I'm a dedicated dog owner. [My pup] (http://imgur.com/ig8GNry), a 2.5-year old herding dog/staffy/spotted mutt's mutt is part of my family and we are committed to her for life, and will always do right by her. We don't make family decisions without her in mind. I've been a committed dog owner for the last 13 years (this one is only 2, the last one passed away from cancer 5 years ago). After I lost my last dog, my husband and I weren't planning on getting another but as longterm fosters for a rescue, we caved and adopted one of our fosters who was not getting adopted. My husband and I were just married a month ago. We both love to travel, and until now, when we would travel, my parents would happily dog-sit for us. We were gifted the opportunity by a friend for basically free flights anywhere we want to go around the world. We want to take this opportunity before kids and "settling down" (whatever that means). Because of the recent health decline of my father, my parents are no longer able to dog-sit for us and we're feeling stuck. I'm trying all kinds of ways to be creative for long-term and responsible dog care but am not coming up with anything that will work. We're willing to pay for dog boarding but do not want to put our pup in a kennel, even if it's cageless. We'd like to be able to find a trusted friend or family to take her on (with compensation), but while she's adorable, exceptionally sweet with people she knows, and very trainable, she is not an easy dog (she has separation anxiety unless she's with another dog, has "stranger danger" and can bark at people, needs a ton of exercise, chases cats and wildlife, and has a high "play" drive so needs to be monitored when playing with other dogs) so it's not the easiest to place her in just any home. She needs a dog savvy person to care for her and keep up with her training (which we've already committed a lot of time and money to). We're considering asking my mom to stay at our house during the day and leave the pup here at night alone, which she is willing to do (it's my dad that we're worried about) but it seems like a huge hassle for her so I'd like to avoid it. She also can't exercise the dog like she needs. Long-term boarding through Dog Vacay or Rover is quite expensive and while we're willing to pay, we can't afford $60/day+ for several months (and have had some not great experiences with those services as well). We're in the Bay Area so doggy care services are not cheap. Has anyone else faced this problem? I'd be open to hear about anything that has worked for people  #8211; there must be a creative solution out there. If we can't come to a good resolution we will just not go on our extended honeymoon, but are hopefully there is some ideas we haven't thought of. tl;dr: looking for a solution for dog-care for an extended honeymoon</TEXT>

    <TITLE>How do I pick up a dropped stitch?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-12-20 07:29:50</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm a novice knitter who likes to make blankets. Every so often, I'll drop a stitch. How can I pick it back up or repair it? As of now, when I notice, I just sort of pull a little loop from the dropped stitch and make a makeshift knit by pulling over the needle and twisting a bit. Doesn't really work. http://i.imgur.com/jxuaCSXh.jpg http://i.imgur.com/NtcfNFnh.jpg I should add that I don't *actually* know if I dropped a stitch but all of a sudden sort of a hole appears so I assume that's what happened.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[Discussion] Looking for tips: high fat/high cal food additives or treats to keep weight on?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-12-21 01:29:16</DATE>
    <TEXT>My 14 year old [kitty] (http://imgur.com/a/EoeCz) tends toward the thin side, and it's a daily battle to keep weight on her. (No health issues, it's just how she is.) We feed her high quality wet food with Primal Nuggets as a topper and crappy dry food (Friskies is usually all she'll eat) mixed in with some good quality/high protein stuff like Tiki Cat. My husband and I are leaving on a 2 month trip and will have a sitter. Since the sitter is unlikely to do everything we do to keep weight on the cat (feeding 5-6 x/day, high cal treats all the time, mixing the wet food like a pro), coupled with the fact that she loses weight when stressed, are there any foolproof weight gain supplements in the form of meal toppers or treats (or anything really) I can leave with the sitter to ensure kitty isn't a bag of bones when we get back?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Just married! Tax filing question for the clueless.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-12-22 20:55:21</DATE>
    <TEXT>My husband and I were just married in Fall of 2016. Neither of us have ever been married before so we've always filed as single (both professional adults w/a long history of filing taxes solo). I know you can file separately once you're married but I don't know the implications of that choice. *HELP!* A few important things to note: 1) I work in the nonprofit field and my income is *significantly* lower than my husband's who is a physician (more than 4x my income). I have a bad feeling I just jumped a tax bracket and now will be taxed at a higher rate even though we don't share finances. Would like to avoid this if possible. 2) My taxes are very straightforward (20 mins on Turbo Tax) while he has deductions and 5 different employers and owns a small piece of property. Would like to keep mine simple. 3) I would prefer to just file my own taxes and have him file his unless there is a penalty for doing that. Thank you for any advice! *edit  #8211; correction: single to separately, thanks for the correction @dweed4!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I am likely going on some form of hormonal birth control to deal with endometriosis but am *very* wary because I tend to be sensitive to hormonal fluctuations. I'm 36 now and I'm sure BC pills are very different now than when I took them from 15-22, but I experienced a ton of side effects depending on which BC pill I was trying, from weight gain an bloating to significant mood swings and acne. Basically, I'm prone to all of it to begin with so a little bit of extra hormones seems to push me over the edge. Anyone similarly sensitive have any luck with low dose hormonal birth control and if so, which one(s)? Thank you!</TEXT>

We don't have hard plans so are able to move around at will via buses and trains. Are there any areas we should head for if we're looking for something not thronged with tourists? Moreover, are there any places we should definitely avoid if we wish to stay away from the crowds and are looking for a more authentic experience of this country? We'd love to see wildlife and experience how folks live their lives here, while still being accessible enough for us to manage. Hopefully that's not too tall of an order!

    <TITLE>[HELP] Traveling in India and puppy is severely (likely mortally) injured</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-02-22 15:49:09</DATE>
    <TEXT>I am in Hampi, India and befriended a litter of puppies. Half are doing well and half not so much. One puppy is severely injured  #8212; the locals say he was attacked by a pack of dogs. He looks to have several broken bones. The litter looks to be about 7 weeks old. He needs urgent care but I don't think there is anything like that here. I'm thinking if he's not somehow better tomorrow the humane thing to do would be to put him out of his misery. Is this crazy? Are there any other options I'm not considering? How would one even do that in India? I'd happily pay for a vet to euthanize him but I can't find any veterinary or animal welfare services here. There is a river here but I doubt I'd have the guts to do that. In an ideal world, I'd find an animal lover and leave the pup with them, with some funds for his recovery, but I can't imagine finding that here...there's not an ex-pat community or much of a middle class here. Please help. Any advice greatly appreciated. ..... UPDATE: This morning he's doing much worse and likely won't make it through the day. The good news is that he's mostly unconscious and doesn't seem to be in pain visibly. We've decided to let him drift off on his own. His siblings were fed a feast of omelette and we sat with the injured pup for a while, gave him some soft pets and wished him well on his journey to a better life. Thank you for all the advice and help. SECOND UPDATE: Sweet little guy has passed on. He died shortly after the last visit yesterday on his own accord  #8212; we knew he didn't have much longer when we saw him last. As sad as we are about this, it's the best possible outcome with the situation as it was. The unfortunate truth is that only the toughest dogs survive puppyhood on the streets in India and unfortunately (or fortunately, depending on how you look at it) he was not a tough one. We are holding him in our thoughts as he crosses over. Amazingly one of the rescue groups we reached out to contacted a welfare group 35 miles outside of Hampi and was ready to send transport for him  #8212; alas, it was too late.</TEXT>

In an ideal world, I'd find an animal lover and leave the pup with them, with some funds for his recovery, but I can't imagine finding that here...there's not an ex-pat community or much of a middle class here. Please help. Any advice greatly appreciated. ..... UPDATE: This morning he's doing much worse and likely won't make it through the day. The good news is that he's mostly unconscious and doesn't seem to be in pain visibly. We've decided to let him drift off on his own. His siblings were fed a feast of omelette and we sat with the injured pup for a while, gave him some soft pets and wished him well on his journey to a better life. Thank you for all the advice and help.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Maldives: just expensive resorts and beautiful beaches or is there something more?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-02-22 17:23:55</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm currently on a trip in South India/Sri Lanka with my husband. Since flights from Sri Lanka to the Maldives are quite affordable and we were able to find some lower cost Airbnb options for homestays we were considering spending our final week there. I have interest in visiting because they're going to be disappearing soon and I always love to visit a new country. But, we're a little worried they're going to be totally resort oriented and really pricey. Would love to hear feedback from anyone who has been. Since this is our honeymoon we'd be happy for a week of R amp;R but we're not really resort types. The other option would be the Andaman Islands which are a little more budget friendly and off the beaten path.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2017-03-06 05:53:50</DATE>
    <TEXT>My husband and I are going to the Andaman Islands for 8 days (leaving tonight! Last minute decision from Colombo). Although it seems they are fairly well off the tourist path, as I look into them, they do seem to have quite a bit of the usual tourist offerings: SCUBA, snorkeling, underwater bubble walking, scooter rentals. We're excited to have a week of R amp;R but would love to do a few off the beaten track things and are looking for recommendations. Individual historical or cultural tours with locals, the opportunity to volunteer, secret beaches, non-exploitative ways to see animals, doing what the locals do, or anything interesting  #8212; basically looking for ways to scratch beneath the surface. If anyone has any personal connections or ideas please post here! Thank you so much.</TEXT>

Any tips on anything appreciated. In an ideal world we'd find some aging classic rockstar to cover it for a benefit album or something but realistically he'd be stoked on a few hundred views on Vimeo. :P He's not looking for money or fame, just to get the song out there.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2017-03-23 09:52:49</DATE>
    <TEXT>My pup was badly bitten by a yellow Lab today while we were hiking. We've been to the vet, been sutured, got pain meds, antibiotics and a cone of shame. It's a nasty puncture wound and she's in a lot of pain at the moment but she'll be fine physically in a couple of weeks assuming no complications and good home care, which she'll be getting. I feel absolutely terrible this happened and even worse presuming she'll have some lasting trauma from it. Is there any way to mitigate whatever lasting psychological effects this might have? Knowing the dog (sensitive, a bit neurotic), I suspect she will be fearful of large Labrador-type dogs after this, be fearful on our normal hiking trail, or both. Anything I can or should do to help? Update: These are all great suggestions and input, thanks to everyone who responded. Really appreciate the wealth of experience and wisdom you all share.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I recently quit my job and am taking about a year to travel (so awesome, so lucky). Because of my husband's work schedule we will be returning home every month for a month (basically one month travel, one month home). I would like to find a way to stay busy in the nonprofit space by consulting during the monthlong periods where I am back in the Bay Area. The money is less important than staying busy, making connections, getting experience and keeping my CV current but of course a little travel money would be helpful. My experience is mostly in communications, social media and traditional media, campaign management, and project management, but I have dabbled in development/fundraising as well and am open to trying new things (and tend to pick up new skills rather easily). I can also hold my own with PHP/Wordpress web development but I'm not sure that's the area I'd like to work in, even in the nonprofit world. I've been working in the environmental field for a while, social justice before that. [Here is] (https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B0KkrU1A0frOWDA3SVkyZDNlaDg) my anonymized CV in case anyone is interested. I'm in the Bay Area, but it would be ideal to find something that I could do remotely most of the time (I have a great home office). PS: Also if this is a stupid idea, feel free to say so.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>[Original post] (https://www.reddit.com/r/DoggyDNA/5ni27h) We finally got Bodie girl's Embark test results back. [Here] (http://imgur.com/a/kW7In) they are, compared with the Wisdom Panel results we did a while back. Same general breed categories (stuffy X herding) but different breeds detected than WP. I was confused about the Lhasa Apso and the Australian Koolie seemed strange as they aren't many around in the US. Although when I contacted WP a couple years ago they said they tested for ACD and they didn't find any markers -- it was only when the test came up basically blank on the herding side that I asked them to rerun her data and they came back with the Koolie. I must say the Embark is more believable but I'm surprised that she is 50% staffie as I've seen photos of her mom and she doesn't look 100% staffie. Also curious if anyone has any insight where the natural bobtail could have come from?</TEXT>

    <DATE>2017-03-31 05:59:32</DATE>
    <TEXT>My husband and I do a fair amount of traveling in poor ("developing") countries and always try to help out the strays when we can, of which there are always many. Some street dogs of course are perfectly okay with their living conditions if the have a source of food, clean water, and are relatively safe from traffic and aggressive animals (and humans). What are your recommendations for the best ways to help out strays when we encounter them? Usually if they're friendly and approach us with a wagging tail we feed them separately, offer fresh water, and remove engorged ticks, especially from their faces and ears. Is there anything else we could be doing? And yes, we are both vaccinated against rabies and would never approach a dog that wasn't friendly. A friend of mine travels with topical flea and tick medication to help the strays, not sure if that is recommended. It seems the majority of health issues come from malnutrition, dehydration, parasites including fleas, ticks, worms and mange, too many litters in the case of females, altercations with other dogs, humans and traffic.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi friends, I'd like to help arrange getting two abandoned puppies (obligatory [pic] (http://imgur.com/a/oFftk)) from Sri Lanka to the United States to be adopted and am looking for ideas on how to do that. Backstory: female puppies are frequently abandoned by the side of the road in Sri Lanka because within a year, they will have their own litters, and no one wants to deal with them. My husband and I found these two malnourished, dehydrated, anemic 4-week old pups on the side of a major road away from town with no access to food or water and after taking them to the vet, found a family to look after them. Amazingly the pups survived but the family is not willing to adopt them. We'd like to get them transported to the US where we can rehome them but are plum out of options (none of the animal welfare groups in the country are able to help with that).

    <TEXT>After losing my employer's health insurance March 1, I missed the special enrollment period to enroll for individual insurance due to being out of the country (I mistakenly assumed I could handle all of this from India). Now, questions. 1) Am I really sh*t out of luck until open enrollment? I'm a mid-30s healthy woman with no pre-existing conditions. There is no one out there who will take my $400/mo to insure me? Is there any kind of interim or emergency insurance I can get in the meantime? 2) Will I be dinged financially or in other ways for being uninsured for 7 months? 3) Are there any implications with the possible repeal of the ACA that I should be freaking out about? A little more info: I have been a Kaiser Permanente member for my entire life, until March of this year. I was married in October  #8211; my husband is a physician, but he is not offered insurance through his work since he is a pool doc. I live in the Bay Area, California.

    <TEXT>My husband and I have an unexpected 5 weeks off from starting June 13 and want to go on a trip (last minute, I know). Any ideas from our fellow avid travelers here? We're currently considering a self guided horse trek in Mongolia coupled with a ride on the Trans-Mongolian train, but the time to get a Russian visa might prevent us from doing that (at least the train). To give you an idea of our travel style, our favorite trips have been a self guided cycle tour from Norway to Croatia, a road trip through Patagonia in a rental car, sailing from Easter Island to Tahiti, busing around South India and sea kayaking around Isla Espiritu Santo near La Paz, Mexico. *Note we prefer to stay away from heavily touristed areas, we try to go to places where our dollar can be stretched, and we want to take advantage of the long midsummer days. We don't have limitless funds for this trip but are not on a strict budget per se.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2017-05-27 20:52:46</DATE>
    <TEXT>My husband and I are American citizens and are planning a trip to Mongolia via Beijing. We're considering doing a Chinese tour to the DPRK for a few days while we're there, and are wondering what the most affordable way to do that is. I've been looking at Koryo Tours for a few years but not sure that is necessarily the best option, it's just the only one I know of. Any other ideas?</TEXT>

We were warned repeatedly that it doesn't sit well with foreigners, but wanted to try it anyway. We shared one bowl, expecting the worst (sorry)...and *loved* it. We drank the whole bowl between us. Sure enough, a few hours later, we both had what felt like moderate food poisoning for about 12 hours (nausea, vomiting, chills), and I had GI problems (heartburn  amp; general indigestion) for days. What gives? What's in this stuff that we can't handle? We're very used to consuming fermented foods in our home country.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2017-07-23 09:53:43</DATE>
    <TEXT>Our camp DJ at our small Burning Man camp just had to pull out and I'd like to learn to DJ for our camp dance parties in the most basic sense  #8212; just a step beyond playing an iPod playlist. (Basic mashups/transitions with classics and maybe adding a background beat to some of them.) I often "DJ" for our camp parties by just playing songs and now that our actual DJ is gone I'd love to not let people down  #8212; we have dance parties of 25-50 people so nothing big. What's the easiest way to do this? iPhone apps, WeGO, mini controllers, I'm open to anything as long as it's not too expensive or time consuming to learn. I have a pretty good sense of basic music composition and can usually match up songs pretty well but help with matching BPMs for mashups would be nice. Bonus points for integrating with Spotify playlists although I'm not sure BPM info is in the metadata. I have music elsewhere but usually use Spotify these days. Thanks in advance for any suggestions  #8212; anything basic that helps make simple mashups will work for me. Not trying to get paid gigs here... Edit: needs to work offline</TEXT>

    <DATE>2017-09-19 01:54:06</DATE>
    <TEXT>My husband and I have 4 weeks off from ~Oct 15-Nov 15 and our travel plans just fell through. The time is fast approaching and we're looking for other options. If you had a month off during this time of year, where would you go? Our requirements: weather needs to be suitable for outdoor activities and relatively stable. Region needs to be suitable for independent travel (no resorts or group tours). Need to not be prohibitively expensive. Nice to haves: we'd love somewhere off the beaten path. We don't tend to be drawn to normal tourist activities or places with a lot of American tourists (we're American so hopefully no offense taken!). We'd love to be able to do a cycle/camping tour if possible but this isn't mandatory. We love good food, so someplace with a food culture would be great. While I personally love metropolitan culture, we BOTH love wild open spaces, so when we travel together we try to find places more suited to that experience than cities. As far as examples, our recent favorite trips have been taking trains around South India, Mongolia (we bought horses and rode across the steppe for 5 weeks), sailing from Easter Island to Tahiti, road tripping through the American southwest, campervanning through the Lakes District in Argentina, bike touring through Eastern Europe, bike touring through Norway above the Arctic Circle, rafting the Colorado River for 4 weeks on a private trip in the Grand Canyon. We really love to camp and love outdoor activities. Any ideas or inspiration welcome!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Cycle tour recommendations for Fall</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-09-19 04:18:15</DATE>
    <TEXT>Going on a last minute cycle tour for a month starting Oct 17 and looking for recommendations on where to go. We would like to camp along the route so weather concerns are front and center. We ride about 80 km/day and are fine with hills, but don't want to spend all of our days slogging uphill. Interesting locations/beautiful scenery/friendly locals/good food all big pluses. Southern Hemisphere is better suited to the time of year but road conditions seem to deteriorate in many of the Southern Hemisphere locations. Considering Southern Europe (Croatia gt;Greece), S Korea, Madagascar, Cuba as possible locations at the moment but weather is a big concern in many of those places (and road conditions/safety in Madagascar). Any ideas welcome!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Recipes that make use of too much homemade fresh-baked sourdough bread?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-09-20 21:07:28</DATE>
    <TEXT>I have two homemade fresh-baked sourdough loaves my mom made me as part of a birthday present (she's a great bread baker) but I don't really have time to eat them before they're stale unless they're incorporated into a main dish. I often will make a simple Tuscan stew-style dish with white beans, tomatoes, oregano, olive oil and garlic over a thick slice of her homemade sourdough (again with more garlic and olive oil, as well as a grating of parmesan) to make use of her bread but that's really all I've got up my sleeve. I've used her homemade sourdough in bread salad before but that's better suited to stale bread. Any additional ideas would be warmly appreciated! Prefer recipes where the bread can still shine (it was just made yesterday so it's still yummy with homemade awesomeness) rather than using crumbs or pulverized bits to thicken sauces.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Anyone done a cycle tour in Japan's southern islands? Talk to me.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-09-22 19:14:53</DATE>
    <TEXT>My husband and I are potentially going to be doing a self guided cycle tour from South Korea to the Southern Islands in Japan this Fall (I know, late planning). If anyone has done this (especially on Kyushu and/or the southern smaller islands), I'd love to hear from you. We are really hoping for a cycling experience in a rural area (some cities are fine but we don't want to be riding through highly populated areas the whole time), with easy camping (or at least mellow/inexpensive places to stay, but ideally camping), relatively courteous drivers, good food, mild weather (or at least a not-high likelihood of driving rain, snow or freezing temps), and not slogging up mountains 90% of the ride. Hot springs (especially camping at hot springs) would be awesome. We usually ride about 80km/day and have touring bikes with slick tires (packed dirt roads are fine but gravel/sand roads are a challenge). It seems like we can make a serviceable route from Seoul to Busan, then ferry to Fukuoka and ride around Kyushu (but we're open to the smaller islands as well -- they look lovely and rural from Google maps but also very mountainous). The Korea section seems to be straightforward but I'm not seeing a clear plan after that. We have 4 weeks total and are very open in regard to route.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've gotten into making yogurt myself the last few months, but have been curious if it's totally necessary to do the pre-heating of the milk step. Since I don't have a double boiler or a candy thermometer (mine recently broke), it's the only part that is a bit of a pain. What happens if I omit that step altogether and just inoculate room temperature (or cold) milk? Second question: one of my containers of yogurt has gone a bit "fizzy" (tastes a bit carbonated/probably over-fermented). Can I use this as a starter or will it make the next batch taste bad?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Just made this tonight with some squash that I picked up at the local farmer's market. So delicious and easy! - 2 large delicata or other winter squash - 1 medium red onion, sliced - 2 TB olive oil - pinch salt - big pinch chopped fresh rosemary (about 1 teaspoon) - 1 TB maple syrup - 1 TB Dijon mustard Preheat oven to 425 #176;F. Cut squash in half lengthwise, then crosswise; scoop out the seeds. Cut lengthwise into  #189;-inch-thick wedges. Toss with onion, 1 tablespoon oil and salt in a large bowl. Spread in an even layer on a baking sheet. Roast, stirring once or twice, until tender and beginning to brown, about 30 minutes. Combine the remaining 1 tablespoon oil, rosemary, syrup and mustard in a small bowl. Toss the vegetables with the dressing. Obviously different herbs and dressing styles can be used (apple cider vinegar would be a nice addition) but this simple recipe works out nicely.</TEXT>

This is my second long bicycle tour and I totally failed on properly packing city/off-bike clothes on my first (packed way too much). This time I'd like to keep my packing list lean and mean but am really struggling with what to bring for when I'm *not* on my bike  #8211; walking around cities, going to dinner, sightseeing, etc. Basically I'll need shoes, good for walking and also maybe sort of that can be dressed up, and at least one nice-ish outfit that can be worn in a variety of scenarios, dressed up/down, and not look homeless after a month of being shoved in a pannier. Needs to be comfortable, multi-use, lightweight, interchangeable, and non-wrinkling. Help! To make things worse I have a serious problem where I don't wear flats unless I'm exercising (which I probably need to let go of -- my last bike tour I hauled around heels for 3 months like an idiot in my panniers that were worn a grand total of two times). Packing space is small  #8211; front and back panniers that need to accommodate camping + cooking gear as well -- but these will be split with my husband.</TEXT>

The noodles are gummy and bland, the flavors in the broth always seem to be lacking, there are hardly any toppings. It's just about the most boring form of noodles I've ever had. I figured if I tried udon in Japan it would change my mind but my one foray into udon here was almost as lackluster as at home. What am I not getting? Am I ordering wrong? Going to the wrong places? Do I need to ask for something specific? Are there certain regions that do it really well? Please help, I wanna love udon! It always looks so delicious but I'm disappointed every time.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Does anyone have a recipe for the awesome soft-boiled (or half-boiled , as it's called here) eggs in their shell that are seasoned with that yummy salty/sweet deliciousness? I can find plenty of recipes online for marinades to use after peeling half-boiled eggs but I'm getting eggs here at convenience stores that are in their shells and still seasoned. Not able to find any recipes online. How is it done??</TEXT>

    <TITLE>What are your theories and practices (whether they align or not) on nutrition while touring?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-11-10 13:11:17</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm at the end of a monthlong tour in Asia and have gotten to the mountainous region of Japan, and am seriously bonking on the long hill climbs. It occurred to me that I haven't put much thought into nutrition while touring and I'm probably doing it all wrong  #8212; essentially using my same food rules at home (no empty calories, trying to eat nutritious foods, good balance of fats/proteins/carbs, several small meals rather than large ones etc.) but more of it. My touring partner lives off of sugary candy between meals and is doing just fine while I am starting to have to walk my bike up long hills when my muscles aren't recovering. Ugh. Would love to hear what you all think and do about nutrition on the road. A few questions: what make the best between-meal snacks? What should I be focusing on during mealtimes? Any difference in what I should be eating for breakfast vs dinner? What is a good ratio for proteins and for carbs/sugar? What else? I'm positive I'm doing it all wrong because I'm bonking *so* hard at this point. Lastly, are there any reliable formulas you use to determine total caloric needs while touring? Most of the online calculators are for riding without a loaded bike and I find I'm either over doing it/gaining weight or under doing it/getting munchies before bed because I haven't had enough calories during the day.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have done my two long tours (3 mos and 1 mo) on a slim profile gel seat. It #8217;s nice for shorter rides but while touring it gets very uncomfortable for my lady parts (pinching, pressure points). I know a Brooks is the gold standard and I #8217;m very willing to invest in one but it seems risky given the break in period (by the time I know if it works, I won #8217;t be able to return it). Plus they really don #8217;t seem comfortable (I know, I know, everyone loves them). Lady tourers: If you have a seat you love to tour in, what is it? If it #8217;s a Brooks, what #8217;s the model? Edit: Just checked current seat, it #8217;s a Selle Italia Diva Gel Flow. It #8217;s great on shorter rides but I get a lot of pinching when touring.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I keep seeing cheap flights to the Bahamas in the wintertime and am always tempted to book a trip there with time off around the holidays but everyone I know who's gone always goes the resort-route. I don't like traveling that way  #8211; #160;I much prefer staying in local accommodation, going to local eateries, and finding my own adventure. With 700 islands surely there must be some off the beaten path adventures to be had? *Sea kayaking from uninhabited island to island while camping on the beaches* would be the dream (if there was an outfit that would rent gear to tourists). I thought I'd open it up to you all expert travelers to see if there were any ideas out there.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Are there any downsides to registering an RV in South Dakota?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-12-10 00:20:06</DATE>
    <TEXT>I have an older RV (1980) I only use once per year for a week that was assembled in Canada with a carburetor, and which has an aftermarket catalytic converter to reduce emissions to California standards. I bought it like this so wasn #8217;t involved in the decision to modify it. It passes smog beautifully with the cat. I was just told I need to remove the cat and get it to pass smog without in order to keep it registered in CA (gotta love California bureaucracy). As an older RV, after consulting a mechanic it seems it will be an expensive endeavor to chase after whatever issue is causing it to not pass (keep in mind it passes with flying colors *with* the cat). As many full time RVers know, it #8217;s possible to register your vehicle there without establishing residency. I #8217;d like to keep the cat on the RV, register it in SD (no smog check necessary) and continue to drive it once per year for a week, in California. Is there any downside to registering the RV in SD I #8217;m not thinking of?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not sure if you can #8217;t afford an adoption fee as others have said or just aren #8217;t familiar with the adoption process in the US. I #8217;ll assume the latter. In the US, if you #8217;d like to adopt a dog you need to pay a fee which goes toward the overhead, food, transport and medical expenses of the organization that took the animal in. The fees are usually between $75 and $300, sometimes more for purebred animals or cities with a higher cost of living. If you can #8217;t afford this, I #8217;d agree you shouldn #8217;t adopt. If that sounds ok, then move onto the next part. Does your living situation allow you to have pets? Get this squared away first. Will you be there for the duration of your stay in the US? Look into the import requirements for your home country to see what bringing a dog back entails. Finally, can you afford to pay upwards of several thousand dollars if needed for veterinary care for your animal? If all of these things are square, I #8217;d suggest visiting your local animal shelter or checking out [Petfinder](www.petfinder.com) online. Another option that might be better suited for your scenario is to foster for a rescue. They provide the dog, usually all the supplies, and you provide the love and a home until they are adopted. I #8217;m sure there are many wonderful rescue orgs in your area who would be thrilled to have you as a foster home. It #8217;s a wonderful way to have a pet in your life without the long term commitment.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>If I wanted to learn Girl Talk-style mashups, where would I begin?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-12-17 20:33:25</DATE>
    <TEXT>I #8217;m really just learning basic DJ skills and got my first CDJ for my birthday a few months ago. I #8217;m a huge fan of Girl Talk-style mashup and would love to be able to do something similar on my own (obviously I #8217;ll never achieve the level of skill required to pull it off like GT but I #8217;d love to try to learn). I am purely a bedroom DJ, learning for my own fun and those of my friends at small parties and for my burning man camp. As far as genres, Rap/R amp;B mixed with classic rock. Where do I start to learn the heavy sampling type of mashup, with 20-30 tracks, with cutting from one track to the next? I don #8217;t even know where to begin. I #8217;ve been wanted to post this question for a while but as a beginner, have been a little scared of backlash on this sub for some reason. But here goes!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Help me add to my list of simple, somewhat uncommon boy's names</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-12-27 22:13:34</DATE>
    <TEXT>My husband and I aren't expecting yet but are about to start trying. I've always had a hard time with boy names, and would love help from you fellow nerds to add to my list. I like names that are somewhat distinctive but not hard to pronounce, and somewhat uncommon, but are familiar enough to not cause problems to for kid. I like nature names, historical names, soft names, and shorter names (1-2 syllables, with 2 probably being ideal with the 1-syllable last name). Last name is Salz (pronounced like Salt, with a Z instead of a T). I am sensitive to flow, so while I love the name Otis, we can't use it because of the double S. Some names that I like (some of which are from recent posts on this sub): - Huxley - Leon - Alden - Lyon (probably better as a middle) - Muir - Hawking - Cyrus (probably my favorite right now, but likely out because of the double S) - Caspian - Hartley (nn Hart) - Soren - Elias - Trace - Zuri - Oden - Redding (nn Red) - Orlan - Harlan - Heath - Jude (a little popular right now for us to use) - Boden and Bowen (love these but can't use bc too close to our dog's name) - Milo (won't use bc too trendy right now where we are) - Felix (won't use bc too trendy right now are) - Nolan (can't use bc close friends have a child named this) - Ansel (love this one) - Caius (love this one but maybe a little hard to pronounce) - Finn (family name, I think I prefer the spelling Fin and like Finley as the longer version) - Orion (love this one but probably a little too trendy to use for us) - Nash (love this one but can't use bc close family has used) - Oren (like this name but Orrin Hatch has ruined it for me)</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; the process is still horrific by my opinion due to animal harm There are some parts of commercial beekeeping that probably wouldn't jibe well with many vegans, but backyard beekeeping is hardly horrific. Can you explain what you feel is horrific about small-scale beekeeping? I'm only pushing you on this bc I think this is a mentality that a lot of vegans hold and I question the veracity of it. Many people are aware of the "save the honeybee" campaigns but few realize that without honey production, humans aren't going to be putting in any legwork to save pollinators anytime soon. (And unfortunately our wild bee populations are in such decline at this point managed care of bees is our only hope to "save" the bees, unless we rapidly reduce human population and eradicate the commercial crops that create foraging desserts for our wild friends.) As as aside, I agree with you that commercial beekeeping could be done in a more humane way overall, but without it, 30% of global crops would fail to grow -- a lot of modern crops are based in part on pollination from hired bees and there aren't enough wild hives to sustain commercial crops. So it's a bit of a Catch-22, the nuance of which is often lost.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Compassion is largely cultural. For example for hundreds of years  #8220;good men #8221; were known to keep slaves, and the hypocrisy wasn #8217;t obvious. At the moment environmental compassion has been largely sidelined and compassion for humans takes precedent  #8212;  #8220;good people #8221; waste environment resources without the hypocrisy being obvious. But yes, I don #8217;t believe religion teaches compassion, only fear of punishment. Compassion [had been shown](https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/religious_people_less_motivated_by_compassion_than_atheists) to motivate the less religious more than the religious.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have a somewhat Instagram famous friend (165k followers) and hang out with him enough I feel I can answer these. His content is solidly outdoors/beautiful hipster friends lifestyle and he is unique in that what made him popular is the depth, relatability and quality of his captains. He actually got a book deal after an 18 month trip and now is a bona fide travel writer (and he has a ready made buying audience in his IG followers). 1. He takes his photos, or any of his also IG famous photographer friends. He always gives photo credit to the photographer if not his own. 2. He #8217;s kind of always hanging out with beautiful people and doing amazing things outdoors with other hipsters so the scene isn #8217;t staged but he and others put considerable effort into getting the right shot. He also has a steady backlog of older photos h can always post. 3. He doesn #8217;t use any software to get followers or likes and barely uses hashtags. He gets likes and followers bc he #8217;s always with and tagging other famous people and his captions are ace. And he has enough followers now that people are always tagging their friends to read his posts. 4. He doesn #8217;t honestly have to try to get a lot of visibility with his posts but he does spend a lot of time and energy writing his content and curating his photos. 5. I #8217;ve seen one get only a few thousand likes instead of the usually 5-10K and he was a little affected by that. He certainly has a  #8220;brand #8221; and a voice he feels the need to uphold.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Pit bulls are not a breed but a broad breed category that are very often misidentified, especially in dog bite cases bc of over-representation in the media. Short haired boxy faced medium sized dog bit your child in the neighborhood? Identified as a  #8220;pit bull type breed #8221; to the police or health care providers? Recorded as a  #8220;pit bull attack #8221; to the CDC regardless if the dog was a Labrador, Boerbel or mixed breed. Can #8217;t always believe statistics. [Here](https://www.amazon.com/Pit-Bull-Battle-over-American/dp/0307961761) is a great read on why the stats for pit bull bites are unreliable.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It #8217;s just a little racially charged to make a sweeping statement like that, and it is certainly not always true. It #8217;s also not race-based  #8212; it #8217;s economics based. Generally places that are better off economically (currently, the global north represents that, while they are glaring exceptions) have prioritized animal welfare higher. Once an animal #8217;s (in this case, human #8217;s) basic needs are met, we can extend ourselves to ease the suffering of others, including animals. However the white/nonwhite statement is certainly not a blanket rule. Have you seen the way dogs are treated in dog fighting communities in rural white America? And have you seen the way street dogs are treated in Buddhist southern Sri Lanka? These are two great examples I #8217;ve experienced firsthand that greatly defy your racially charged stereotype.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Saddle is definitely wrong and trying to find one that works. My Selle Italia women #8217;s gel saddle hurts soft tissue (labial area) and puts me too forward. I just tried a Terry Butterfly for a two hour ride and it mostly leaves my lady bits in peace but puts a *lot* of pressure on my inner sit bones. Which is probably preferable but I think I still haven #8217;t gotten it right. I usually ride in Pearl Izumi shorts but I guess they #8217;re not the super top end ones, so the bike shop that #8217;s letting me demo saddles suggested I may want to upgrade.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I hear you, but in my experience, *no one* tends to be more of a turd than high end tourists paying top dollar for a package tour. Littering, disrespecting the environment and people working for them, and generally being dicks. I've done a lot of traveling in a wide range economic classes of travelers, and there's no one I'd entrust a fragile ecosystem to less than entitled tourists overpaying for an experience. As far as sheer numbers, I agree with you that the cost will price out 95% of people wanting to visit a place, which is a good thing, but people will muck a place up no matter the price they've paid to get there. Ensuring that doesn't happen falls squarely in the lap of the people, companies, governments and regulatory agencies managing tourism there.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No response will measure up to u/wheatfields excellent comment, but wanted to piggyback on the finding meaning piece  #8212; I did a few long solo trips in my 20s, and I found a strategy to get settled into a new place and find some purpose and community: volunteer. I would use sites like Idealist to find and connect with organizations whose mission I was drawn to and volunteer with them for a week. The ones with formal volunteer programs are great, because there are often other young people there to meet and bond with, but pretty much any org will take you up on an offer for free work. If you have skills from working at home that will be useful to them, all the better. If you #8217;re bilingual English/Spanish that is always helpful. Not sure if that resonates with you, but just wanted to share.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Will she eat beans? A nice soup with a bean base and added meat (chicken or sausage) might go over well if made with a flavorful stock (homemade is best) as the beans will take on the flavor of the meaty stock. Easy to add some extra veggies in there. Or a Meat stew with carrots, onions, and potatoes  #8212; they just take on the flavor of the meat. Also I #8217;ve found that roasting veggies gets a caramelization that non-veggie folks seem to love. You could do roasted mushrooms and throw in some others like Brussels sprouts. I have an awesome easy lentil soup recipe made with homemade chicken stock that basically everyone loves  #8212; I add sausage sometimes (and often kale but you could skip that). Homemade pizza might be a good option with finely chopped chard on top (and if she likes mushrooms and tomatoes, may as well toss those on). Tomato soup with crusty bread. Burger with extra veggie condiments  #8212; caramelized onions, romaine lettuce, thick cut tomato. Homemade mac and cheese with sweet potato [link](https://thrivinghomeblog.com/2012/03/a-healthy-better-mac-and-cheese/). If you #8217;re making a recipe with ground beef, reduce the amount of beef and add in some finely chopped mushroom (and of course onion). Zucchini brownies or carrot cake for dessert!</TEXT>

Save yourself the time and money of trying to deal with this at home and see a professional.

    <TEXT>I've asked this question *so* many times of *so* many people in Asian countries. I usually get some version of "it's just what we do" but it often has to do with pollution. There seems to be a connection with germs and illness outbreaks, but I've also heard the argument that the underlying reason could be philosophical: All three countries have been broadly influenced by Taoism and the health precepts of Traditional Chinese Medicine, in which breath and breathing are seen as a central element in good health. The intake of noxious air is seen as a primary vector for introducing illness in any form. So, protecting one's health by wearing a mask is just common sense. [Here's] (https://qz.com/299003/a-quick-history-of-why-asians-wear-surgical-masks-in-public/) an interesting article about the history of surgical masks in Asia. And as u/dutatt said, it's become fashionable now.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My dog passed away while I was away traveling a few years ago  #8211; it was horrible. I was home for 6 weeks between research expeditions on a sailing trip when she was diagnosed with aggressive osterosarcoma and given  #8211; you guessed it, 6 weeks to live. I spent those 6 weeks at many a vet office debating treatment vs. non-treatment (settled on the latter since treatment is painful, required amputation and radiation, and would only give her on average another year) and trying to give her the best 6 weeks possible, as much pain as she was in. At the end of the 6 weeks, lo and behold, she seemed to be improving. I pushed my departure back 5 days, as much as I could without missing the launch date. I took her to watch the sunset on the top of our favorite mountain, fed her steak, and had her friends over. It was time to leave. She still seemed to be okay. I left, and left her in the good hands of my parents, telling her I'd see her when I got back, hoping for (and actually expecting) a miracle. After 48 hours of travel to Easter Island and another 24 of being offline, I got on the boat, to news that her health quickly declined and my parents decided to have her euthanized. I was beside myself. I felt guilty for leaving her. I felt like I failed her. And most of all, on a 72-foot sailboat with 14 crew members, most of whom I didn't know, and no place for a private moment, I felt like I couldn't grieve. I sat on the bow of that sailboat for what felt like two days straight and cried my eyes out. A few people came to see me and try to comfort me, but I mostly sat alone (or as alone as you can be on a medium sized sailboat), asking for company only when I was ready. And you know what? I slogged through my grief process and was glad I stuck it out (I too considered going home before we pushed off). This is an emotionally wrought time for you, and you need to give yourself permission to grieve. Going home isn't going to feel right either  #8211; your dog won't be there. Don't try to stick to whatever plans you had before unless that feels appropriate. Give yourself some days (or weeks, whatever it takes) in a place that allows you to go through what you need to. For me, I needed solitude and reflection in a quiet, beautiful space, but for you, it might be different. Something that helped me was to start writing to my dog in my journal  #8211; saying the goodbyes I didn't get to. Slowly, you will emerge from your acute grief and be able to see the world again, and it will be all the more beautiful and meaningful because of your loss. Take some time for yourself, stay on your trip, dig in, and continue to live your best life. Embracing the now is a beautiful way to honor your dog, who I'm sure was a pro at living in the moment.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;ve been a Verizon customer for about 12 years, and currently on a Family Plan with my folks. My mom #8217;s been hearing about all the money we could save by switching to Xfinity Mobile and wants to do so. We #8217;re currently paying $150 for 3 lines, I think we have 10GB of data. My parents use very little data, but I use about 6GB/mo. Important to me is WiFi calling, being able to use my phone internationally by swapping SIM cards, and bringing my own phone. Important to my parents is bringing their phones and lower prices. Other than the fact that Comcast is basically the devil and customer service is supposed to be horrible, what should I watch out for?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't have any answers but I just wanted to say that I am in the same boat. I'm 37 years old, married to the love of my life, have a robust network of awesome friends I adore, and we get to travel a lot. I work in the nonprofit field so don't have a ton of expendable income, but my husband has a high income earning potential in his field. I am so torn...on one hand I love my freedom and don't want to shift my relationship with my husband. On the other, I'm an only child, and my family is already shrinking. When I think about the short-term, having kids doesn't seem enjoyable. But when I think of myself as a much older woman, do I want to be surrounded by adult children and their own families? Do I want to have a relationship with an adult daughter or son? You betcha. I am just so torn. I am feeling the pressure of my late-30s and *really* needing to make up my mind soon. Every day, I poll both sides of myself to see how much I am wanting or not wanting children that day  #8211; 20/80, 40/60, I've gotten as high as 60 (yes)/40 (no), and recently, momentarily, to 80/20. But I just do not know. This is the hardest decision of my life, and I feel tormented by it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This stinks! Echoing the many other responses that suggest not using Facebook for anything you actually need to depend on people to come to. Don't let this deter you, it's just a learning experience. Next time, come up with a core group of 10 friends you really want to be there, invite by email (or text, or phone call, or whatever the social norms of your friend circle are), let them know they can bring someone but you need to know X days in advance, and send a couple follow up emails/texts/whatever is appropriate, but *don't* use Facebook. I don't know anyone who actually means what they say in those Facebook event RSVPs. There are simply too many of them for them to mean anything. More personal is better.

It could be a camp that doesn #8217;t want to transport their personal infrastructure to and from BRC yearly and is willing to pay for storage/drop off. Established international camps can fall into this category, as well as any camp that just wish to store their things in Gerlach rather than haul it out each year.

    <TEXT>Our situation is this: we have been an art support camp with a registered art project for the last 3 years. We #8217;ve had a container for the same amount of time (but that was not dependent on interactivity or services provided to the community  #8212; we just bought it from the org). Our art project may not come out this year for various reasons, and I see that camps can be placed solely on the basis on being a  #8220;container camp. #8221; (Because the org has to know where to drop the container  #8212; thus all camps with a container have to be placed regardless of their level of interactivity.) I #8217;m wondering where these container-only camps are typically placed, as there is probably an established zone for them. Our neighborhood has been in the 4:30/B sector for many many years (you used to be able to camp there without placement) and we #8217;d like to stay within that neighborhood if possible.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> #8220;Container camp #8221; is a classification for placement  #8212; you don #8217;t have to be city infrastructure (DPW, BLM, Pyro, ESD, Gate, Perimeter, Ranger, etc), art or mutant vehicle support (a camp that brought a piece of stationary art or art car) or theme camp to have one. Any camp who wants one and is willing to pay for a container can have one. I think what you mean by support and other camps not being camps is that they are not *theme* camps, because surely they are all camps. My camp is usually an art support camp, and we are still a camp  #8212; referred to as such by the org and by ourselves of course. And then there are the countless interactive or supportive camps who do not wish to jump through the placement hoops but of course they are still camps.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Most folks in this community will not help with this question (nor do they know, probably), as PnP camps are generally frowned on by the org and anyone invested in the Burning Man community. Further, your friend unlikely to have a great experience at a PnP camp as they #8217;re fairly insular and saying you #8217;re camped at one when out and about generally gets some scoffs. If you or your friend is set on camping with one, look up names of big ones that have made a name for themselves and find their Facebook page and reach out. But your friend is much more likely to have a fulfilling experience outside of one. A better option is for your friend to go to a regional event, as recommended, make some friends, offer to pitch in some help, and find a non-PnP camp that way. Or, have them camp with you.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It depends on the animal. Some have enormous variation in diet. It's not really relevant to compare humans to other animals for diet advice  #8211; much more relevant is a comparison with traditional *human* hunter gatherer diets. Of course since farming took over, almost all hunter gatherer people are gone, but there are a few examples we can look to (i.e. Kalahari, Sentinelese, Pirah #227;). Modern, and we can assume, ancient hunter gatherers typically consume(d) over 100 different species of plants throughout the year and approximately 10-15 animal species, with numerous insects, with vast regional variation. So, we definitely evolved to eat a varied diet.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Conceiving with a cycle length from 20-30 days</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-04-09 00:26:54</DATE>
    <TEXT>I #8217;m 37 and my husband and I are finally ready to start trying for a baby. (I know, late bloomer! We didn #8217;t think we #8217;d ever get there.) However over the last couple of years my cycle has gotten increasingly varied and I fear it will inhibit my chances to conceive or that it indicates I #8217;m not ovulating normally. Below is my cycle length history for the past year. 23 days 30 days 20 days 25 days 30 days 24 days 23 days 24 days 27 days 49 days (skipped a period presumed due to illness) 29 days 20 days 26 days 24 days 31 days 22 days Overall the average is 24 days but as you can see it #8217;s quite varied (and that #8217;s skewed with the skipped period). The final data point I know is that I got pregnant in 2012 (miscarriage) on the 5th or 6th day of my cycle. That was an accidental pregnancy and I haven #8217;t tried since. I #8217;m at a loss for knowing when to try and would love to hear anyone #8217;s thoughts who has them on what days and what frequency to have sex to get pregnant. Thank you!</TEXT>

However, stores will still be selling through the older pints, so you may see both the older pints still as well as the up-to-date pints for a little bit of time!

    <TEXT>I'd like to help a friend of mine who has high interest loans and has been unable to get out of the hole because of them with a low interest person-to-person loan. He has a good paying job and I'm not really worried about his ability to repay me. But, I would like some protection and structure around the loan. In addition, I have a small group of friends who are willing to go in as lenders to reduce risk and burden. All of his loans consolidated would be about 60k, but I am happy to start with a smaller loan to build lender confidence (since there is a group of us) and make sure this will work. I think we'd all be happy with about 5% interest rate. Are there any resources for people in our position (to help structure P2P loans for friends)?</TEXT>

I know some of his loans are 29% which would be the ones I'd be keen on getting him out of right away. He's really only paying down interest right now on many of them which is awful obviously. I don't have a huge concern about him losing his job but of course that's always a possibility. However he's in a lucrative field and is good at what he does so his employability is high.</TEXT>

Obviously he is not good with money, which is how he got into the jam in the first place...but it's more along the lines of being a couple of weeks late on car payments rather than totally fucking up and defaulting on payments altogether. Getting something as collateral is a good idea, but I'd need to think about what that would be. He doesn't own his home, is making payments on his truck, etc. Although I guess he would pay off the truck with the loan and that could be partial collateral.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2018-05-09 18:30:21</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm looking for stylish leather men's slip on casual shoes with a solid midsole that can be resoled for life. This is for a 39-year old man, so nothing too grandpa-y. Handmade is nice, just want them to last  #8211; we're willing to spend some money on these (but in the hundreds, not thousands). Thank you in advance for any ideas!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Argon could work, with Xenon as a close second, although it has a somewhat negative definition as others have mentioned. The others have to strong of associations IMO to use them as names (neon signs, Krypton/Kryptonite/Superman, radon causes cancer and is in basements).</TEXT>

I have this portable stovetop oven that came with my Eurovan I've never used (and don't see myself using as I don't do a lot of baking on the road). I'd love to give it to someone who will use it. If you're a baker and do a lot of camping or living out of your van and think you could use this baby to make some olallieberry pie or butter rolls, I'd be happy to send it to you. (I just ask that you pay the price of shipping.) Please PM me how I can get it to you and I'd be happy to send it!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not a doc but I #8217;ve had butt breakouts like these when traveling or cycling for long periods of time and it #8217;s always been bacterial related. Since you say you #8217;re a clean person maybe your breakouts are more hormonally related but making sure your bottom is both clean and dry before dressing in the morning and going to sleep at night, if you #8217;re not already, would be a good first step. After that, try aquaphor! A thin layer before I go to sleep would clear up my butt breakouts. (It #8217;s a little counter-intuitive I know, but a dermatologist I saw at one point told me aquaphor is non-comedogenic.)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The only place I've traveled alone I didn't totally love being alone in was Morocco (especially Casablanca)  #8211; I was young and often got either harassed or ignored as women traveling unaccompanied by men clashes with their cultural norms. I've been a lot of other places alone: Indonesia (in the more conservative Muslim areas, had the same problem as above though), all over Southeast Asia (Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Burma), Mexico, Cuba, Brazil, many countries in Western and Southern Europe (Croatia, Germany, Czech Republic, Slovenia, Austria). I'm married now to another avid traveler so don't get to do much of it anymore, but I love love love solo traveling. I usually spend much of my time walking around new cities, exploring corners, following a trail of interest wherever it leads me, spending long mornings at cafes people watching, reading in public areas (which is halfway people watching), hiking, being outdoors, trying new food (especially little holes in the wall), trying to connect with locals and doing some of the normal touristy stuff (whatever would be in the highlight section of your guidebook). I'm usually not, but occasionally I'll be feeling social and stay in a hostel to meet fellow travelers. I usually spend a LOT of time doing things that would normally bore a traveling partner (like the above). When I'm with a traveling partner, even when it's my husband, I feel like we have to be on the go all the time, packing our days with activities. It's more relaxing to travel alone for me, and I get to put a lot more energy into observing and being absorbed by a culture. Another tactic I've used when solo traveling is to link up with a local NGO and volunteer for a few days/week. That often helps with a slow intro into culture, helps connect meaningfully with locals and also sometimes helps to meet other fellow travelers (if there is a formal volunteer program).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I wanted to add that my absolute favorite part of traveling alone is that it's my only chance to be whoever I want to be. You can reinvent yourself every day, and when you come home, you will bring the best bits of who you were when traveling with you, and it will help you grow into the best version of you. When we're bound by others' views of ourselves, we don't have the freedom to experiment with our identity. Even small things like, you're not usually a social party person but when you're traveling solo you might spend all night drinking and connecting with new friends at a bar just for something to do, and you realize there's actually something to be said for extending yourself socially, and you bring that back home. It can be challenging to transform in that way when you're with someone who knows you well. (Not sure if that makes sense, but it's very clear in my head and I think about it all the time when I travel alone.)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Where are you starting from? (Sounds like you are US-based.) Do you have a specific time frame and time of year you're working with (i.e. for one week in July)? If you have your budget set, that's a great starting point. One thing to consider is what kinds of travel you generally like to do  #8211; adventure or park it. Park it would be like rent an Airbnb in one city and stay put, explore the city by foot, and get a routine down (or stay in a resort on the beach, depending on your interests). Adventure would be more on the go, trying to do and see a lot of things in one area  #8211; wanting to take it all in. I'm the latter, but many people seek vacation time to rest and relax. These are among the easiest solo trips to plan! But either way is great.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'd like to add something in case you end up going back to work sooner than people here (and your doc) are recommending. I'm not sure how you interface with your customers, but there are prevention measures you can and should take: wash your hands religiously. Don't touch your hands to your face at all, but especially your mouth, nose, eyes if you have secretions. If you need to cough, cough *away* from customers and anything they would ever touch, and cough into the crook of your elbow, never your hands. Same goes for sneezing. If you ever cough or sneeze, wash your hands. Disinfect doorknobs and countertops (wherever customers touch) if you touch them as well. You could also wear a face mask which would prevent viral droplets from coming from your mouth if you cough. It's not a given that you will infect someone with your illness if you're contagious and are around them  #8211; viruses aren't just floating in the air. But you must take extensive precautions to avoid infecting customers if you're indeed contagious. And if you are preparing uncooked food, you are increasing chances by a lot that you will infect them if you're contagious, just something to think about.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It #8217;s going to be impossible to figure out what #8217;s going on without her sharing what she #8217;s feeling with you. How is your communication generally? I would make getting to the bottom of this a priority. Try to lovingly initiate a conversation about this during non-sexy times. Not sure how much time alone you get with your wife between kids and work but this deserves a frank and compassionate conversation. Let her know you love her and are happy to be married to her (assuming that #8217;s true, sounds like it is), and want to make sure both of you are happy. That you #8217;ve noticed a change in her behavior romantically/sexually and you #8217;d like to talk about it. Don #8217;t be accusatory or demand answers  #8212; she may not really know what #8217;s going on either. Explain what you #8217;ve been noticing and that you #8217;ve been wracking your brain for why things may have shifted, and ask if she has any insight to what may be going on. It might be a series of conversations but at the very least get the communication going. Try not to pressure her for answers but let her know you #8217;d like to continue to work on having a sex life that is fun for both of you and ask if there #8217;s anything you can do to make things better for her. It #8217;s a good place to start. If she #8217;s not open to this conversation, you may need to end it, remind her you love her and that if she ever wants to talk, you #8217;re all ears. And then make a game plan going forward. Does she want you to initiate sex right now or is it making things worse? Does she want a little break from sexy time until she gets things figured out? tl/dr: 1) You #8217;ve got to get to the bottom of this; 2) communication is the only way; 3) it might take a while but don #8217;t stop communicating with your wife about sex  #8212; it #8217;s important (At a married woman who has lapses in my sex drive/wanting to have sex with my darling hubby)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Near-constant butterflies in my stomach</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-05-21 08:01:52</DATE>
    <TEXT>For the last several days, I have had a near-constant sensation of having butterflies in my stomach. I get a physical sensation/rush when I think about almost anything, read a line in a book, think about anything happening in the future. I would estimate the number of times I #8217;ve had the  #8220;butterflies in my stomach #8221; sensation over the last few days to be in the many hundreds. I #8217;ve also had insomnia for the same time period and seem to have a lot of stamina/energy when I exercise. The only two things that have changed I can think of is 1) I #8217;ve been giving my cat transdermal prednisone every morning for the last several days (however the dose is incredibly small (.1 ml), I #8217;m wearing latex gloves when I apply it, and I wash my hands immediately, so I can #8217;t imagine I #8217;m absorbing any, and it would be the tiniest microdose if I was); and 2) I #8217;ve been using Flonase at night for a stuffy nose due to a lingering cold. What #8217;s going on? I feel like my fight or flight response is in absolute overdrive and it #8217;s exhausting. Age: 37 Sex: female Height: 5 #8217;3 #8221; Weight: 115 Race: white</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You're right that focusing on consumer reduction is not going to change things much. (Although you can argue that people need to be connected to a cause to help enact policy changes, and BYO bags/reusable cup/etc. is an easy way to feel connection to an issue that's hard to approach as a consumer.) Yes we need proper waste management systems and facilities in place, but more importantly, it's policy. And Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Actually, plastic cannot be truly recycled, ever. Recycling means producing the same product again. Plastic loses its tensile strength after one heating, so it can only be downcycled. So our plastic "recycling" can be made into fleece clothing, composite wood/plastic lumber, and shitty Chinese toys that will break and be thrown away. Eventually all plastic created will end up in a landfill or waterway.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Stopping its use for disposable products *is* the answer. True recycling (being able to make the same product over and over again without losing quality or adding virgin material  #8211; metals and glass recycling work this way) is not possible for plastics, only *downcycling*. So shitty plastic products in China, fleece clothing, or composite building materials can be made from post-consumer plastic, but only once (bc the tensile strength of plastic is degraded with each heating). Then it needs to be landfilled. Recycling plastics is the biggest farce in modern waste management. Don't use it for disposable items in the first place.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[Help] Antisocial, anxious, depressed dog lives under the house</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-05-21 20:23:10</DATE>
    <TEXT>Breed: Springer Spaniel/corgi mix Age: 4 Sex: Female, spayed My mom's sensitive dog Cricket, who she's had since she adopted from a rescue at 8 weeks, is becoming increasingly antisocial. She basically lives under their house. She goes under the house in the morning, comes up for lunch when my dad takes her for a walk, goes back down until my parents force her to come up for dinner/nighttime. At night she mostly sleeps under their bed. She seems depressed and anxious and is obviously antisocial, and we all feel really bad for her. This has been going on for a couple of years, starting when the neighbors had ongoing construction for a year straight, but is really bad at the moment. They've tried prozac, and also CBD oil. Neither really helped. There is no abuse in her history we know of (she was brought to a shelter as a 7 week puppy with her litter and adopted at 8 weeks) and nothing else we can think of. She's very well cared for and very loved. She lives with another dog, an older shih tzu mix. She's rarely left alone as both of my parents work from home, and she's taken out for short walks many times day by my dad. She wags her tail when she sees people she knows, and likes to bark at activity on the street, but other than that, she just seems to be a very depressed and antisocial dog. She also jumps at the slightest noise  #8211; #160;very anxious. And won't go near a house with construction happening on her walks. She enjoys going on drives, but lately has been wanting to turn around on her walks and go home. My mom is wondering if she should block off the under-house access point, since she thinks it's encouraging her antisocial behavior, but my dad insists she be allowed to be there since she seems to feel safe there. They're asking for my opinion, but I am at a loss. Puppy tax: [here] (https://imgur.com/a/mCw82iu) is a painting my dad did of Cricket.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hard to say. She seems a little indifferent to the company of other dogs. While she lives with another older dog, they don't interact very much (although they go on walks together). My dog goes over for a visit sometimes and she's such a bowling ball that I think sort of mows over poor Cricket. When my dog was a puppy, they used to play, but Cricket was only one and still basically a pup herself.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>She does seem to be in some kind of mental distress from something not obvious. She's been taken to the vet for this about a year ago; I'm not sure what tests were done if any, but that's when Prozac was prescribed. I can check with my mom on that. I did advise my mom that pain needs to be ruled out. There's nothing obviously wrong with her but she does have achondroplastic dwarfism from the Corgi parent, and I know back problems can arise with long-backed dogs.</TEXT>

They don #8217;t get a lot of local love and from my experience seeing tourists be kind to strays can influence locals to be a little kinder. I found two abandoned female puppies by a highway and we took them in, bathed and fed them, took them to a vet and found a family to care for them! We still get photos of them over a year later.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In my experience the "we can be friends" thing doesn't tend to go over well when men are very interested in you sexually or romantically. Most likely, he doesn't really want to be your friend, he wants to be your romantic partner (or whatever terms you guys have put on the visit). Put yourself in his shoes. What would you want if the tables were turned? My guess is you would want him to be direct, honest, and kind. Not beat around the bush. Just be kind, as it sounds like you already are, and tell him the truth  #8211; that you've met someone you like IRL and therefore unfortunately the visit is off, and you're really sorry to disappoint him.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>First credit card for someone in their late 30s</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-05-24 06:51:09</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm 37 years old and if you can believe it, do not have a credit card. I took my parents' advice when I was 18 to not get a credit card a little too literally. Anyway, I've been using my bank card for purchases and autopay for as long as I can remember. I've managed to achieve pretty good credit score (I think it was in the mid-700s last time I checked) by getting a few used car loans and paying utilities and such off in a timely manner. ANYWAY, I think it's probably dumb to pay everything these days with a card that has access *straight* to my bank account, so I figure it's time for a real credit card. I'm a conservative spender, I'm not going to make any large purchases, and there is zero reason I will not be paying this off every month. Any tips on how to pick a first card? Travel is important to me, so accrual of airline miles is key, and I guess also low (or no?) monthly/yearly fees. Not sure what other criteria to use to choose one, there seem to be a zillion options.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>He isn't crated as punishment; if you crate train him, his crate is his sanctuary. My heeler mix pup adores her crate and willingly spends many hours a day in there with the door open. When we have guests, she goes in the crate with her kong (she's often not trustworthy with guests either.) We've gotten to the point where once the guests are settled, she comes out for a visit and she's fine, but there's nothing wrong with keeping your pup crated while you have visitors. It's not a punishment. It's to keep your guests and your dog safe.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You can definitely crate train an adult dog. You can start by feeding him in his crate to get him familiar with it, and with a positive association. Put his bed in the crate. You can ask him to go in his crate, give him treats while he is inside. slowly work up to closing the door (still dropping treats into the crate) for 5 minutes, then open and see if he wants to come out. Make it a positive experience for him. I've fostered about 100 rescue dogs, many of them adults, and all of them slept in a crate in my home without trouble. [Here] (http://www.humanesociety.org/animals/dogs/tips/crate_training.html) is a good overview by the Humane Society of the United States. And this isn't much different than his safe spot, other than you can close it when visitors come over to keep them (and your dog) safe. If he already enjoys a closet as his sanctuary, you could start crate training by putting the crate in the closet (with a bed). Or, you could use the closet functionally as a crate, as long as it's closable.</TEXT>

It definitely doesn't last forever, though, and like every experience, the trick is to integrate that great juju into the rest of your life and take it with you as much as possible.

    <TEXT>Cool, thanks! I'll try that on interview day then. 600mg was mellow. I maybe didn't even feel it. I did notice some brain fog (not sure if I can really blame it on the phenibut though), but also possibly a willingness to sit and talk to people a bit more, and a small decrease in social anxiety (although I worked from home today and only had modest social interactions). I was in a great mood early this evening on my bicycle, but I've been in a good mood this whole week so not sure if that's attributable either. I'd like to try a higher dose tomorrow, as I will be out and about in the evening visiting with friends. Is brain fog something that's usually reported?

    <TEXT>Most times when I leave my dog home alone for any length of time (a couple hours or more) I will leave her with a stuffed kong, bone with frozen peanut butter, or other long-lasting high value treat so she has something to occupy herself with while I'm gone. Invariably, when I come home, she will pick up the kong/bone and enthusiastically start munching away, but it doesn't look like she's touched it while I was gone. Why is this? I thought perhaps she was a little too nervous to eat (she has a bit of separation anxiety) but she will definitely steal the cat's food and get into the trash while I'm out!

    <TEXT>Unless you're serious about training a protection animal, I would stop this line of thinking right here. Getting a dog with a "strong bite" for defending against intruders is a recipe for disaster unless you're planning on some hefty investment of time and money into training yourselves and the animal. A barking dog is a great deterrent for home intruders and usually all that is required. Most small dogs are excellent watch dogs in that they alert to outside noises and people coming into the home. In addition, many herders/dogs who were bred to be watchful over herds and flocks of animals and make decisions on their own (such as cattle dogs and border collies) are naturally suspicious and will bark at strangers (but beware, these breed types need a LOT of mental and physical stimulation as well to have in the home!). I have an ACD/pit bull mix and she is a great guard dog (although that is not a trait I look for in a pet) and is friendly to visitors once it's been established they are part of the pack, but it takes a lot of training and a watchful eye to ensure new greetings go well.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Crate training an adult dog is entirely possible. If you're away from the house for 8+ hours a day, you will need to ensure the dog's physical needs are met before you leave (eat/drink/potty and exercise) and then have a dog walker come midday, and then take your dog out again when you are home. Eventually depending on the dog's personality you will likely be able to leave her/him uncrated during the day while you are out.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My sweet Kiska has left this earth and was a rescue from a shelter from puppyhood, so I will never know what breed she was. She was all alone as a young pup in a cage, without a litter (so no breed context by looking at litter mates). I've had many dogs in my life, but is the best dog I've ever had. She may have been a mutt, but everyone always commented how beautiful she was, and I can't help but think she was some as-of-yet undiscovered purebred rare dog. I've seen [Icelandic Sheepdogs] (http://www.icelandic-sheepdog-picture-gallery.com/res/Default/vaskuravbjornli.jpg) in person and spoken with their owners and I must say, she bore a striking resemblance both physically and personality-wise to them. She was a sensitive dog, quite cat-like, quietly affectionate to one person (me!), very active, insanely intelligent, very independent, very confident, did not like being left alone, loved outdoor activities, athletic, and shared some herding traits (stalking behavior, herding children and some animals). She preferred the company of northern breed dogs such as huskies when she had the option. She also had high EQ in the doggy world (she was a dominant female and didn't take any shit but knew how to win any dog over in social settings). I've never met another dog like her. Anyone have any guesses as to what she may have been? She does look quite Chow-like, but didn't have any spots on her tongue nor did she have much similarity to Chows in the personality department  #8211; she wasn't much of a guard dog, didn't have an aggressive or reactive bone in her body, very balanced, got along with every dog and every person she ever met. The only time she flexed any muscle was one time I was physically attacked and she got in between the aggressor and I physically. We had one of the early DNA tests on her, and there were only 37 breed available in the database and I don't think they were very reliable, but she did come back as having some ancestral Border Collie or Australian Shepherd DNA, and that was all that was detected (but again I am not convinced they were reliable back in 2007).

    <TEXT>Yeah she had a fully pink tongue. She does look a bit more like that chow you linked to (never heard of an open faced Chow!) but with less of a "heavy" face. She was born in 1997, and I know Chows were popular in the 80s and 90s so it's not out of the question, but she was so darned friendly and balanced, I just never got a Chow sense from her. But of course you never know. I always called her a "Husky mix" but I do think she had some herder influence of some sort based on what I know about Aussies and BCs (plus her janky 2007 DNA mix came back with ancestral herder DNA).</TEXT>

But yeah she's a quite people-focused dog, and is mostly attached to me. So I assume you're right and that is probably it. I *wish* she would go into hibernation when I was gone, but I fear that she makes herself quite stressed (based on the observation that when I come home she is tense and whiny and has to run outside to frantically drink water or go potty, even if it's been a short time).</TEXT>

I don't buy a purebred Chow for a second, but won't write off the possibility she could be a mix. Edit: Why are my comments doubting my dog was a purebred Chow are being downvoted? I lived with this dog for 11 years and certainly know what purebred Chows look and act like...that breed also didn #8217;t come up in the DNA test, and it was tested for (but not sure how reliable they were in 2007).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Agree with everyone above re: you carving time out to help her get away for yoga, walks, meal planning, etc. Also there #8217;s a great online web program Yoga Glo you could get her a subscription to, but it might be hard to focus with three kids in the house so you would need to be very diligent during that time so she can concentrate and relax for an hour. Lastly, re: what to actually say, sounds like you #8217;re saying all the right things (minus the word  #8220;jiggle! #8221;). Rub her back and give her a massage if she will enjoy that, make her know by your actions you still find her attractive and help her enjoy her body in non-mom ways (although she may have enough tiny humans climbing all over her that she just wants a break from physical touch!).</TEXT>

I gave them my email address and they followed up with the above posted email. (Some is cut of, can share the rest if anyone is interested.) It's basically saying they are a Japanese company that sells light bulbs, fluorescent lamps, halogen bulbs, mercury lamps, alarm wires, and all kinds of other electrical equipment. They seem to have a legitimate website. They are looking for a "North American business partner" to help retrieve debt from North American vendors. They're not asking for any capital or investment to start the position. Is this a scam?</TEXT>

There are also a fair amount of resources out there around community based projects to dig into as a result (community resilience). But what about personal wellbeing and psychological resilience?

    <TEXT>Interesting no one has mentioned this, but if she generally has relatively good hygiene otherwise, she probably has bacterial vaginosis. Vaginas (even unwashed ones) don #8217;t usually have an emanating smell. BV is quite common and usually has a  #8220;fishy #8221; odor. I definitely think you need to tell her about your observation (you could even include a white lie that an ex of yours had BV once with the same smell and she could pop into her OBGYN for an apt), because obviously you #8217;re not going to have a sexual relationship with her at least while this problem is occurring. She will definitely be mortified (so be as kind as possible) and this will probably be the end of your little relationship but who knows, maybe she can get her BV cleared up (it #8217;s a simple treatment) and you can try again. That is, if you even want to.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[Help] Resources for introducing new kitten to resident dog</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-06-08 19:29:46</DATE>
    <TEXT>My MIL has an 11-year old shepherd mix with a strong prey drive (I know, not starting out well). She recently decided to get a kitten, as her last cat passed away recently. Her last cat and same dog also met when the dog was an adult and they had reached a calm equilibrium in the home. She's had animals all her life and is savvy enough to do this right but I thought I'd post on this sub asking for your favorite resources on bringing a new cat into a home with a dog (and a somewhat predatory one at that). I know many of you will say this is a bad idea overall and I actually agree with you, but now that the cat has been brought home I'd like to help set her up for success as much as possible. While she can use Google as well as the best of us, I would love to point her to books, articles, and online trusted resources. I'm asking r/dogs because it's primarily the dogs' behavior we're worried about. Cat is 4 months old. At this point, kitty and dog have been separated into different areas of the house with no chance of meeting, are getting acquainted to each other's smells with clothing and towels (and each others' scents on their humans). Kitty has been home for over 2 weeks and they haven't yet met so they're taking it very slow and cautiously. She works from home and is prepared to manage their intros very carefully and supervise their interactions together for as long as it takes.</TEXT>

Can be broad (how to build a resilient community and self) or specific (urban farms, examples of local economy, etc.).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Being overly skeptical of strangers is a herder trait. I deal with this constantly on a daily basis with my ACD/BC mix. She doesn #8217;t really say hello to anyone she doesn #8217;t know, eyes every new person *very suspiciously*, and targets about 1 in 10 people to flip out on  #8212; bark, hackles up, occasionally lunge, if she #8217;s off leash which is rare, circle. She #8217;s aggressively jumped on a person 4 times in 4 years so I keep her leashed now. It #8217;s really hard. So to some degree, it #8217;s inherent in your dog #8217;s breed and you will be dealing with this for its whole life most likely. But you can definitely work on it and lessen it. I keep a pocket of small high value treats handy and give the  #8220;watch me #8221; command (an essential tool for working with a dog like yours) whenever we see a new person and give her a treat. It #8217;s usually enough to break the tension. If it #8217;s a person with a triggering quality (disabled/using a walker/with a strange gate, a child with a backpack or instrument, an obese person, someone who is homeless or lacks hygiene who gives off a noticeable smell, people with big hats, the list goes on...) I will give a series of simple commands to keep her attention on me. Watch me, touch, and sit mainly but paw and down if more is needed. I also use the  #8220;find it #8221; command and throw a treat on the ground for her to locate. The name of the game is distract, redirect, get focus on you, and provide positive reinforcement (treats and praise) when focus is kept on you. It requires consistency, and paying close attention to body language to catch the dog before it #8217;s triggered however, bc then it #8217;s usually too late. While I love the intelligence and activity level of my pup, this behavioral trait is why I #8217;ll never get a herder again. If you think about the jobs they were bred to do, it makes sense. They were selectively bred to watch over a flock or herd of animals, often on their own, had to make most decisions on their own, and being suspicious of any newcomers (who often didn #8217;t have the best intentions) enabled them to keep their animals safe. They bonded closely with their owner but no one else. Suspicious herders were more successful at their jobs, so those were the ones who were bred. It didn #8217;t behoove them to be friendly to new people or novelty in any sense. Versus, say, Labradors, who had to get into boats with people other than their owners to retrieve waterfowl, and had friendliness to strangers bred into them as a behavioral trait.</TEXT>

Last time was a recent direct flight from SFO to Mumbai (sooo f*ing long), I was in the middle seat, my husband at the window and I lucked out by getting an open aisle seat. Which means I could actually spread out, lay my head on my hubby #8217;s lap and get some sleep. No sooner had I done this someone comes by, asks me if they can sit in the aisle seat. So of course like a chump I agree and give up the rare luxury of getting sleep on a long international flight in economy seating. Argh.</TEXT>

And positive reinforcement/distraction is definitely the way to go with these guys bc their reaction is fear based, so you don #8217;t want to increase their worry with aversive training measures (not that you are so inclined, but just to make sure you get in a positive reinforcement class)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Oh yeah, I know. I volunteered at a rescue (European run) in Oaxaca for 6 weeks and helped with the pickups. Definitely a different culture around dogs as pets. But some dogs are true street dogs  #8212; they #8217;ve been born and raised on the street, with no one to look after them in any way, usually with many generations under the same circumstances. Village dogs, as they #8217;re normally called. I only ask bc often  #8220;owned dogs #8221; (and that is a loose term I understand) are from shitty backyard breeders and there is some semblance of a recognized breed in their genetic makeup, whereas village dogs usually don #8217;t have recognizable breed genetics.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks for the background. Yeah it #8217;s hard on the heart to work in animal welfare in developing countries for sure. Super awesome you were able to gather some gringo resources and get all those animals spay/neutered. I keep on dreaming of coming up with an implantable dog sterilizer (like the human contraceptive implants) and get a sterilization clinic in Mexico. I will add though that Mexico isn #8217;t any different than other developing countries I #8217;ve been to (with the exception of Hindu and Buddhist parts of the world, which tend to have humane treatment of all living things as part of their main tenets). When I was in Oaxaca there was a nearby BYB of German Shepherds and Malinois (so many of the strays were shepherd-like).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You know TBH the whole system was pretty broken. The rescue operators obviously have big hearts but no one wants to adopt adult dogs (and mostly female too, although they were spayed #8212; such a macho culture), so it turned into basically a sanctuary. Hardly any of the dogs ever left, as international adoptions were a rarity (two flights to get back to the US, not conveniently located, and gringos tended to pick up puppies from the streets of they were going to adopt). So they had hundreds of dogs and more coming every day. Just not sustainable. At least the dogs got veterinary care and weren #8217;t pregnant but life outlook wasn #8217;t great. It #8217;s hard to come into a country as an outsider and expect to affect much change in a deeply embedded cultural trait. All that is to say, it sadly was more frustrating than rewarding, and it #8217;s what inspired me to want to come up with an implantable canine contraceptive as a solution rather than focus on individual dogs. (That #8217;s not to say I don #8217;t pick up puppies in dire straits when I #8217;m there and find them homes but it feels like a microscopic bandaid on an enormous problem that really demands a more systemic approach.) That #8217;s why your efforts of getting a ton of dogs spay/neutered is so rad  #8212; very effective. Especially if you can target one area and literally get all the dogs there, it has a massive impact. I met an organization in Sri Lanka when I was there last year that had a very effective sterilization program  #8212; they were spay/neutering all the street dogs, town by town, as well as anyone #8217;s pet dog who allowed it (and clipping ears so they knew which ones were done). They #8217;d basically stopped the tide of incoming new strays in the whole southwest of the island and were slowly making their way around the rest. (MUCH easier to do on an island obviously.)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I live in Marin. I have a very small welding project  #8212; should take 10 minutes. Stainless steel. There are literally no welding shops around here anymore. Anyone know of a secret spot not listed on Yelp/Google?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It all used to work just fine before cell phones were operational out there. If need be, fine, turn on the tower for pre and post event (although I #8217;ve worked on several massive projects w/out the use of cell phones just fine). Likewise, most great things in human history were pulled off without constant updates/reminders/ETAs from a cell phone. Having phones connected out there takes away so much, for such small gains in convenience. It #8217;s one of the few places left where you a huge population of people can truly be immersed, off grid, and present. This is spoken as someone who had a true emergency at home last year out there and dealt with it the old fashioned way.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I can guarantee you that it #8217;s not your face. All kinds of different looking people find love and people who are attracted to them (especially men). Tinder/online dating may not be the place for you to find love, but you have a high chance of success for finding love IRL if you are a good person. (Online dating is obviously based solely on looks.) Work on your self esteem, and be kind to yourself and to others. It will shine through.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I got to know this wonderful horse in Mongolia last summer and left him at a horse camp near UB after 5 weeks spent with him carrying our gear in the countryside. I know he's nearing the end of his useful life there (was told he would likely be slaughtered at age 10 for meat, and he's about 10 now) and would like to see about the process of bringing him back to the US where I can give him an early retirement with a herd of 14 horses on a large plot of land near my home. Does anyone have any experience with this? I know there are some laws about needing permits to bring a Mongolian horse out of the country but don't know how to start the process of obtaining one (or even if that is possible as a citizen). The horse is a gelding so there is no chance of me breeding him. Any help or guidance greatly appreciated.</TEXT>

I do know he #8217;s used to be transported in the back of a pickup truck (which is really not the same of course). There is a good chance as you say that it would be a negative experience for him. That said, it wouldn #8217;t be just a few more years of his life it would be extending and improving, it #8217;s about 2/3 of his life (dead at 10 vs dead at 30-or-so, the age most horses live to over here)  #8212; which does feel worth it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thank you for the thoughtful response! I have a Pioneer DDJ-SB2 my husband gifted me 6 months ago but I've been too busy to get everything set up, am just trying to start now. So whatever software I use will need to work with that. The reason I would like to move away from DJay Pro on MacOS (I'm a MacOS person too) is that I do have this controller now, so I would like to learn how to use it. As far as my aspirations, I have zero intention of ever having paid gigs. Last year I DJ'd (sorry for using that as a verb since it's a pet peeve of yours!) our Burning Man art project and at our camp with some other (more experienced) DJs and had *SO* much fun, so my intent is to do that again, plus DJ small parties with friends in the future. Strictly for fun. I'm not into house or techno. I've done Motown/Funk/hip-hop, 80s/90s, Balkan, Cumbia, electroswing and Hi-NRG/disco sets (*not* all together, jeez! These were all individual sets depending on time of day and crowd). We have a mobile Burning Man art project with fire effects that we bring to other art projects and let people dance around/interact with. So as you can see I'm all over the place  #8211; I just like to play around with music and beats, read the crowd, and make people dance. As I learn more I am sure I will probably narrow my interests. I would like to get good at beat matching, phrasing, flow, hopefully some mashups at some point and maybe making beats. I really love a good 90s hip hop/80s jams set all mashed up and I would love to be able to be more skilled at those transitions. I'd like to play around with hip hop beats and Balkan music, swing beats and old jazz. Just be experimental. I know I don't have all the terms down and barely any of the skills but I do have a great time with it and people seem to enjoy letting me do it. It's a very fun atmosphere, we have a big flaming, rolling sign on the playa at Burning Man and people flock to us from all over the place; it's fun to follow other art projects around with huge speakers playing electroswing or getting everyone to dance to Naughty by Nature mixed with the Jackson 5 or something else fun and silly. I don't take myself too seriously with all of this but I would certainly like to develop my skills. I know as far as real DJing goes, that's all probably wrong or dumb or whatever, but hopefully that gives you a picture of my intentions.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m sure this will get buried, but... Your girl sounds like she has an [ #8220;anxious attachment style #8221;] (https://www.psychalive.org/understanding-ambivalent-anxious-attachment/). The number of people out there who can deal with a partner like that is very low, and no one would blame you for not being one of them. She will have this attachment style (need constant reassurance, always need to be in contact, make up crazy stories about what is happening if you don #8217;t pick up a call/answer a text, spend lots of time obsessing about the relationship, always want more than you can give) for her whole life. Unless you want to put up with all this drama, you should just end it. Explain to her that you meant what you said in the moment but it was the MDMA talking and you can #8217;t sustain that enhanced connection while sober, and that you can #8217;t give her what she needs in a relationship (constant reassurance) so it #8217;s best to call it off.

    <TEXT>I did end up defrosting it (it was vacuum sealed in a freezer-safe bag). I then cut it into large chunks, browned the meat, sauteed the veggies, dredged the meat chunks in flour/salt, and dumped it all into the slow cooker with a slurry I made with beef broth and a bunch of other stuff like pepper, tomato paste, a glug of worcestershire sauce, a splash of fish sauce, a splash of soy, some anchovy paste, and a packet of unflavored Knox gelatin I had in the fridge. I'll let you know how it turns out! I turned it up on high but since everything is basically already cooked, I'm thinking of reducing it to low in a few hours (but not sure that's a good idea).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Re: the gelatin, I know it sounds weird and I've actually never used it before, but I was adapting a beef stew recipe from [Serious Eats] (https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2016/01/all-american-beef-stew-recipe.html). It's a recipe from Kenji, who has never led me astray. According to Kenji, "gelatin adds body to the sauce without muddying flavors while umami-rich ingredients add depth." Makes sense as I was using store bought beef stock  #8211; when I make my own, it has a lot of natural gelatin from cooking the bones for 48 hours, and the boxed stuff is very thin. So maybe adding gelatin is just making up for shitty stock! :)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Just how bad is Fancy Feast for a cat's health?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-06-21 07:07:56</DATE>
    <TEXT>Let me start off by saying I love my almost-16 year old [cat](https://imgur.com/Ikrhw5K) to the moon and back, and would do anything to keep her on this planet for as long as possible, so long as she is living in relative comfort. She is a picky little thing, and in the last 10 or so years, it's been a struggle to keep weight on her. (I hear Siamese mixes are often this way.) She's indoor/outdoor, and she free feeds. I used to give her high quality kibble topped with her favorite "junk food" to encourage eating, Fancy Feast kibble, till I learned how bad just kibble was on their kidneys. Starting about 5 years ago I have heavily supplemented with high quality expensive canned food, on rotation (she wouldn't eat the same thing more than once a week, so I had to cycle through). She had a bad vet visit a few months ago and got very sick from a dental cleaning, and it took a lot of meds, force feeding, subQ hydration and TLC to bring her back to "normal." Since then, she will only eat Fancy Feast kibble. She won't touch any of the high quality kibble I get her, and isn't really interested in wet food. So my question is, how bad is it for her health? I know it's basically the equivalent of me eating McDonalds for every meal of my life, but she starts to go downhill quickly when she gets thin, so keeping meat on her bones is very important. I'll add she doesn't even touch cooked salmon or other fish, fresh chicken, cooked liver, or any of the other whole foods I give her. She will eat crappy cat treats from Walmart though. Ugh.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Update: you #8217;re right the gelatin was a little weird! It actually made it a little too rich for me and I ended up needing to cut with water.

    <TEXT>As others have said, you seem very kind and caring so I'm sure you will do fine in this conversation. Most important thing is listening to her. She most likely will want to talk through her feelings on this with you, as it sounds like she hasn't shared this with many people, and all women feel differently about this choice. This is a great time to practice active listening ([https://www.skillsyouneed.com/ips/active-listening.html](https://www.skillsyouneed.com/ips/active-listening.html)). (Certainly some aspects of this article may not be appropriate at all times, such as smiling.) Don't be distracted, give her your full attention for as long as she wants to talk, and be a source of comfort for her. Also don't be afraid to process some of your emotions with her as well, after she's had a chance to, #160;as long as the dynamic doesn't get unbalanced. Keep in mind she did have to go through this alone and probably will need more support than you will. A real, connecting hug (not a quick compulsory one) would probably be appreciated if she gets emotional, or at the end of your talk. If it does get emotional, feel free to suggest a walk outside, that can help. I would disagree that offering to pay for half of the price for the abortion (or even all of it) is in bad taste. On the contrary, it shows you're taking responsibility for your part in this. It's not really about the money. A good friend of mine just went through this and while she is in her late 30s and very financially stable, the fact that the guy offered to pay for the cost of the abortion meant a lot to her (and she did take him up on it). Not sure how much time you're planning together for the meeting, but it might be a nice idea to allow for a couple hours after the talk to go do something together  #8211; #160;grab something to eat or drink. Don't use it as a chance to get physical, but to bring some levity after an intense talk. And if you really like this girl and would like to see her again, be sure to let her know. It may or may not be what she wants, but it will be nice to let her know honestly that this hasn't changed how you feel about her (and in fact it would probably bring you closer if you did decide to date again). At the end, let her know your door is always open if she wants to talk about this some more with you. She probably won't, but it will be nice for her to know she can bring this up again if she needs to.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That #8217;s just not what happens though. There are examples on the *very far ends* of the spectrum where vaginas are either very narrow, wide, long or short but by and large they fall into the broad middle of the bell curve and what #8217;s more, size variations are usually not detectable by male sexual partners. The average erect penis is about 33% longer than the average vagina (by global standards). While both penis and vagina sizes can vary, these organs can usually accommodate each other. The more common mismatch is that women with shorter vaginal canals experience discomfort when a penis bumps up against their cervix (either because the penis is a bit too long for the depth of her vagina and the male partner is thrusting too deeply or, more commonly, she is given insufficient time to be aroused enough for vaginal tenting to happen). This is what we should be educating male sexual partners on, not propagating the myth of loose vs. tight vaginas.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah it's not significant, but it is an obvious change from 8 weeks ago and since it's never happened before, I want to address it before it becomes significant. I am currently sitting for two hours with castor oil on my hair and have some lab tests scheduled for next week. My doc said what you did, that hair loss in females is typically not along the hairline like this, but I have to wonder what is going on then. It's very thin and patchy with very visible minimization all of a sudden. Can mites or fungus do something like this? The only real change is that I started washing my hair significantly less than I used to (I try to stretch it 2-3 weeks) so that made me think that possibly build up of sebum might be causing some problems.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Socializing and making new friends abroad is a great reason to travel, and what #8217;s more, can improve your social life at home. Since you have countless opportunities to reinvent yourself while traveling solo, focus on developing sociability skills that you can bring home with you (assuming you would like to be more social/have more friends at home). For me these have included getting outside of my comfort zone, doing things I don #8217;t normally do at home where I might meet new people, focusing on kindness to others and genuinely being interested in what they have to say, and sharpening my skills to quickly connect to others such as eye contact, active listening and inclusion. We often aren #8217;t actually taught sociability skills, and getting out in the world solo is a great way to jump into the deep end of life and bring skills you develop back home. I attribute a great deal of my people skills to learning to communicate with and gain shared experiences with people I #8217;ve met abroad, especially when there isn #8217;t a shared language.</TEXT>

Other than diving and snorkeling (which I will do), what are some other adventures to be had? Looking for day trips, hiking, great beaches, ruins, animals, good food, local tips, fun to be had for free, supporting local economy and off the beaten path things to do. I #8217;d also appreciate recommendations for best part of the island to stay on/explore, inexpensive places to stay (looking for hostels with private rooms and inexpensive Airbnbs) and transportation.

    <TITLE>Getting Open Water certified with hydrophobia</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-07-20 19:18:28</DATE>
    <TEXT>I have a dual relationship with water  #8212; I am both in love with it (especially sea life) and work to protect it in my professional life, but also am hydrophobic (specifically, fear of drowning, fear of waves and strong current, tendency to panic when breathing is hindered in water). I #8217;ve resigned myself to snorkeling at the surface, which I love, but have recently learned to dive down a bit while snorkeling, which I also love! The fact that I can pop back up to the surface if I ever get panicky is great. Just knowing that I could means I actually don #8217;t need to. I am in Roatan, Honduras, and am enjoying snorkeling here. There are of course, many great dive shops offering PADI certification courses for ridiculously low prices. In my heart of hearts I would love to get certified and more comfortable in the water, but am nervous to attempt such a thing for fear of irritating the dive instructor or other students with my fear/hesitation. I #8217;ve taken a two day entry PADI course in Belize and loved it (although it took me about 30 mins to take my first breath from the regulator, kept popping up) but didn #8217;t get certified. I tried to get the certification yesterday to spearfish the invasive lionfish in Honduras but couldn #8217;t complete it bc I needed to free dive to 12 feet which I #8217;m not able to do (I also have trouble equalizing my ears which is a whole other issue). The instructor recommended I take a free diving course here, which I am SO tempted to do, but I have the same fears about irritating the instructor or other students and not being able to complete it. I love being in the water but do tend to panic easily in strong current or swell, or when physically exhausted or if breathing is inhibited. (I #8217;m MUCH better than I used to be though.) Even just yesterday I nearly panicked when swimming back to the beach from a reef I was snorkeling at when the current got strong with whitecaps and I got really tired. (This is the Caribbean, for godssake, how choppy could it have been?!) Is there any hope for me? Should I challenge myself with a PADI course and hope for the best or am I just setting myself up for failure and disappointment? I am a 37 year old woman, if that matters. I basically just didn #8217;t get much exposure to water activities as a youngster but attempted them as an adult, half-drowning myself in the process a few times, which instilled a fear. And maybe there #8217;s something deeper too  #8212; I remember thinking as a kid I drowned in a boating accident in a past life, ha. tl/dr; I am hydrophobic but would love to get PADI certified or take a free diving course. Is there any way to make this happen or should I just accept it #8217;s not for me?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Completely normal. That #8217;s not creepy at all, it #8217;s sweet and means you #8217;re attracted to her (and apparently miss her!). Smell is one of our strongest mate attractants  #8212; I #8217;ve been with guys in the past I thought were aesthetically gorgeous but if I didn #8217;t love their smell, it was doomed to failure. My current partner (now husband) could go unbathed for days and I would still love his smell, I could nuzzle in his armpits all night. I think the way he smells is a giant turn on. I will also note that the concept of a partner #8217;s  #8220;smell #8221; is varied  #8212; when most people say that, what they actually mean is the fragrances in products their partner uses and/or their cologne/perfume. Behind all that is their actual human smell, harder to detect (stronger when they don #8217;t bathe!) but always there nonetheless. Humans have a pretty weak sense of smell in the animal kingdom so the smell of other humans is usually in the sub-perceptible level. My hubby doesn #8217;t use any scented products so the  #8220;smell #8221; I #8217;m detecting is actually him (or more accurately, his microbiome but that is getting quite nerdy). What the majority of people are referring to is the smell of fragranced products their partner uses, with a bit of underlying actual scent of the human underneath all that. But still, it has a great deal to do with attraction and no one needs to feel weird about enjoying the way their partner smells.</TEXT>

I keep getting drawn back to water activities (wanting to learn to dive, learning to duck under waves, white water rafting, sailing across an ocean for 35 days and swimming in 12,000 #8217; deep ocean) both bc I love it and I really want to face my fears, but I keep hitting against this problem of wanting to do stuff but being a little scared and then deciding or being told I probably shouldn #8217;t do it.

    <TEXT>This is really great advice, thank you. And, I absolutely know what you mean (and agree) that language matters. It's hard to not want to take advantage of the low-cost diving certification and warm water in Roatan though! I talked with a dive instructor today who suggested I do another "Discover SCUBA" PADI course, what do you think about that? It seems pretty tame. Side note: are you from the US? If so, do you know the approximate cost to get certified in the US? The place I talked to today was $325 (and I don't think they're one of the cheapest ones, but it seems like a dumb thing to bargain hunt for when you're talking $25-$50 and safety and lifelong learning is on the line). Also, what are your thoughts about a free diving course? I really don't have any interest in learning to dive to 60' but getting better at diving underwater with my snorkel would be awesome. I would be super happy to get down to 15'. Part of this is getting better at equalizing my ears, I know...unfortunately the plug-your-nose-and-blow technique doesn't work with my anatomy, I guess -- the only thing that works is opening my mouth/fake yawning and wiggling my jaw side to side at the same time, which doesn't work with a regulator, and even with just a mask, sends water flooding in as the shape of my face is changed.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well no, of course not, but that is a bit extreme. I mean I #8217;m not a total mess  #8212; I can swim, I can take care of myself in the water, and I #8217;m not a proven liability. I #8217;ve never asked for help in the water and have been in some somewhat hairy situations with swift current, large waves, and a tiger shark. I think I may have given the wrong impression here. I just probably have more water anxiety than your average SCUBA student and there #8217;s a not-small likelihood that I will either decide not to complete the full instruction or won #8217;t be able to equalize my ears, both of which would be a bummer. But I don #8217;t really think I #8217;m asking instructors and dive shops to risk their livelihood on me any more than your run of the mill slightly more anxiety-prone beginner diver. (For example, I went snorkeling with a group of people who were much less comfortable in the water than I was, couldn #8217;t swim out to the reef 150 meters away and couldn #8217;t dive under; they #8217;re all starting their OW certification course tomorrow, and none of them are worrying about these things or asking these questions. But then, that #8217;s me, I #8217;m a worrier.)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Good on you! A lot of negativity on here (and some valid questions about future planning) but all in all I #8217;d say you guys are doing some interesting stuff, challenging the status quo and ruffling some feathers (often a good sign). My hubby and I travel quite a bit and I #8217;m currently writing this from Central America where I am solo. I arrange it differently though  #8212; sabbaticals from work, taking advantage of all vacation days from work for international travel, and scheduling a long trip abroad during work gaps. But then, I #8217;m at a different point in my life career-wise than you guys are. People are always incredulous at the amount of time I spend abroad and say they  #8220;wish they could do that #8221; but fail to prioritize travel so don #8217;t do it. I #8217;ve missed out on many things at home (including important family events and career opportunities) and am far financially poorer as a result but I wouldn #8217;t trade this lifestyle for anything. One suggestion: consider at some point staying put for a year or so or returning home, saving up a bigger nest egg by working your asses off, and then heading back out. $7k in the bank is great but as others have said, will be eaten up quickly if things go south for any reason. I couldn #8217;t determine if your passive income is equal to your monthly expenses (many commenters assumed you #8217;re living off your savings now which I hope isn #8217;t true) but that #8217;s a obviously a fast way to get fucked fast. I #8217;ve met many, many people doing long term/lifestyle travel in many parts of the world over the years and the successful ones  #8212; the ones who could keep it up for a very long time  #8212; had a better plan than it sounds like you do for financing their lives (unless you #8217;re able to cover your monthly expenses and also add to your savings while on the road, which is awesome if so). But no biggie. You #8217;re still young and can always rebuild your savings if you need to, but definitely keep scheming about ways to make this lifestyle actually sustainable long term and prepare for things outside your control. Thanks for sharing your story.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Have you considered working with someone (therapist/psychotherapist) who has experience with psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy? I #8217;m not saying that you necessarily should trip again (although if you do, this would be an excellent opportunity to exorcise those demons, under the guidance of a pro), but talking with someone in a controlled setting who is skilled at guiding others through some of the uncomfortable social observations you had while tripping that continue to haunt you might be enormously helpful. In fact I would go so far as to suggest someone like this is the only kind of mental health professional who would  #8220;get it. #8221; I #8217;ve had experiences such as yours on consciousness altering substances (psychedelics yes, but also whopping doses of weed, and once prednisone prescribed for an allergic reaction if you can believe it) and while those experiences haven #8217;t crippled me in the ways it sounds like your LSD trip has, they have certainly informed my interpretation of others and I pick up on subtle nuances in others #8217; social interactions and the way they deal (or don #8217;t deal) with their insecurities as they arise. I feel there is important work to be done here for you, and however you address it, I would encourage you to not just push it away. Ultimately for me, seeing people #8217;s vulnerabilities plastered across their faces and watching as their coping mechanisms involuntarily take over has led me to a greatly increased level of compassion for others and for the human condition. It sounds like for you, it had the opposite effect, but it #8217;s possible to use the knowledge/insight you now have to love other humans more deeply, instead of feeling you can  #8220;see through them #8221; and are sick of seeing it all played out over and over. You #8217;ve seen past the veil, and behind the masks we all carry. That #8217;s a beautiful (and a frightening) thing. Just remember, all those coping mechanisms were developed to protect ourselves at a very young age, and they serve most people quite well, at least on the surface. Dropping those is the dissolution of ego, living as a conditionless human  #8212; and very few have attained that level of  #8220;enlightenment, #8221; as we call it in the West (although we have a very shallow and limited concept of it). It sounds like you #8217;ve essentially developed a pervasive anxiety condition after some intense insight about social behaviors and other people you picked up on during a negative trip. You can either try to address the anxiety as a stand-alone issue, which is sounds like you #8217;ve tried to do and haven #8217;t been successful, or go to the source of your anxiety, this new insight you have that doesn #8217;t feel good, and try to make peace with that knowledge, and find the beauty in it. I recommend the latter, but you can keep hammering away at tucking that insight away if that feels safer. Edit: I #8217;d like to add that EMDR might be helpful for you. Not sure where you are but if you #8217;re near a major metropolitan area I #8217;m sure you can find a practitioner.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It #8217;s just one way to conceptualize your thoughts as a separate entity from your consciousness. It doesn #8217;t have to be directional, as though it #8217;s a cool way to see/describe it. For me, I watch my thoughts go by like I am people watching, or like sitting on the side of the road watching cars drive by. I don #8217;t follow or attach myself to any specific thought but instead let them go on by me, completely separate from me. Mine generally all go the same direction but I have in the last watched thoughts dart all around like meteors in the sky and have been able to achieve the same distancing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is what I would advocate for as well, but I would combine a dose of a tryptomine such as MDMA before dosing with LSD (both can be smaller doses if that feels better) which is a heart opener and will allow you to feel more connected to people  #8212; even just thinking about them  #8212; than LSD alone. It has a nice synergistic effect. Feel free to PM me if you want!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ultimately I believe you need to sit with your anxiety and learn that it #8217;s not going to kill you (or even hurt you). I promise you, it won #8217;t! You don #8217;t need to run away from it or avoid it. That only makes it stronger. Most people spend their lives avoiding their anxieties, especially their social anxieties, which is what you #8217;re picking up on. You can clearly see that neurotic defense mechanism at play in your social interactions, and it #8217;s making you neurotic yourself, trying to appease and avoid it. Everyone has this except the most evolved of humanity. I wish I could tell you to not let it freak you out, that you can use your insight to be more compassionate with other humans as you see the effects of the insecurities they #8217;re grappling with and their coping strategies written all over their faces, but I know that #8217;s too simple. Normally I would suggest you can work on sitting with your anxiety through meditation, but it sounds like your anxiety has reached apocalyptic levels, likely brought on by LSD. This isn #8217;t the most uncommon thing in the world so don #8217;t feel like a weirdo. Often a deep perspective shift takes place for people with psychedelics, and often it #8217;s quite positive. Yours has been negative, and I #8217;m so sorry for that, but yes, drugs are not all party time and fun visuals. LSD is powerful stuff and it will enable a sensitive person such as yourself to see behind people #8217;s masks. What you do with that newfound insight is up to you, but it doesn #8217;t have to be a monster hiding under the bed. It #8217;s just plain ol #8217; human insecurity. We are smart animals in many ways, we pick up on environmental cues, our goal is always self preservation, and we can evolved to live in social clans. Things happen along the process of a young person #8217;s life that hurt them, made them feel invaluable, like they can #8217;t trust others, and need to protect themselves. These formative experiences are instructional, and shape our protective layer. Therefor there must be some artifice in adult social interactions for us to keep going  #8212; our protective layer. We all have it. It #8217;s what enabled us to get where we are today. It would be great if we could all walk around with masks off and relate to each other as our highest selves. But guess what? There are jobs to be done, competition to be had, other people to get ahead of so that we and our families may eat. So we keep our masks bc for the most part they serve us. They are simple, they are obvious, and they serve us as far as preservation goes. You #8217;re seeing all these masks and it #8217;s freaking you out. Understandable. I would go deeper. Ideally, find someone to sit with you while you investigate, either via meditation or more psychedelics, if you #8217;re up for it. Read the latest Michael Pollan book, How to Change your Mind. Listen to some recent Jim Carey interviews and bus graduation speech. Watch The Mask and The Truman Show again with a new lens, while you #8217;re at it. Listen to Terence McKenna and Alan Watts. Feel free to PM me if you #8217;d like.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well as far as having hydrophobia or not, it #8217;s not a diagnosis by a medical professional, it #8217;s my own assessment (and likely an exaggeration) but I do have a latent fear of water (strong current, deep water, drowning). That said I do plenty of water activities and just came back from snorkeling off a 50 #8217; wall I had to swim very far out to, it #8217;s just that I need to focus on my breathing and sort of self soothe during all of these water activities when I #8217;m not touching the bottom or I need to swim underwater. I guess if you #8217;re truly hydrophobic you #8217;re not willing to go in the water, so technically I #8217;m not that, but I worry that with the anxiety welling up that I always need to tamp down, it would cause problems in learning to scuba dive.</TEXT>

Everything is truly ridiculously expensive, I think we spent like $60-$80 at the grocery store every day for dinner/food, which is maybe not so bad for two people who were eating about 4k calories/day each but it did add up. That and ferries were the only things we spent money on, along with the occasional hut at a campground ($50). Beer or booze was definitely out of the question, and we were grateful we didn't need petrol bc it was crazy expensive. The only cheap thing we found in that country was salmon, and it was incredible.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Generally a good answer but I have some tweaks and adds. Firstly, an open mouth pant isn #8217;t necessarily a sign of excitement, it #8217;s a sign of panting/being hot  #8212; panting is how dogs cool off since they can #8217;t sweat except for on their pads  #8212; however this often goes along with exertion and play which dogs generally enjoy. But not all open mouth pants accompany happiness. I #8217;ll add that panting can also be a sign of stress, so while that looks like happiness it #8217;s quite the opposite. (I can #8217;t tell you how many of my friends look at my dog in my car and assume she #8217;s  #8220;smiling bc she #8217;s excited to go on an adventure, #8221; when in actuality she #8217;s panting because she is stressed in the car.) Secondly there #8217;s a final smile you didn #8217;t describe  #8212; the [submissive grin](https://goo.gl/images/6p77Qr), in which a dog pulls back its lips and flattens its eyes to indicate appeasement. Interestingly, many monkeys and [apes](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/gorilla-grins) do the same thing, and there are some theories that this is the origin of human smiling.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>People unused to seeing the world, much less independent long term travel, just don #8217;t know what to say. They want to hear about your travels but have no reference point so ask stupid questions. Use it as a jumping off point to start sharing what *was* meaningful/fun/life-changing about your travels, and it will broaden their horizons. A simple  #8220;didn #8217;t meet a wife, but I did meet (...insert story of inspiring person or experience...) should work!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Any ideas? Needs to be Saturday night, close to the river would be awesome but not necessary. Close to Healdsburg awesome but not necessary. We can either tent camp or pull my Eurovan up to a sweet spot and spend the night. I know bc of the timing, proximity and the Napa fires, the pickings are slim.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don #8217;t think this tactic is going to work. Hear me out  #8212; number one, finding common interests is one of the joys of dating, and having those realization unfold over a courtship in an organic way keeps men (and all of us, really!) interested. If everything is on the table right away, a bit of the mystery is lost. Secondly, most people (and I #8217;d wager especially men) actually *like* it when a potential partner #8217;s interests are different than their own. It #8217;s sexy to hear someone gush about something their passionate about, especially if I don #8217;t know much about it! My passions are music, horses, animal rescue and gardening. If someone else I was just starting to date listed all those things as their passions too, it wouldn #8217;t be a turn on  #8212; quote the opposite. I actually think I #8217;d be pretty quick to assume they were desperate to show how much we had in common. It sounds like you have a lot of passions and exciting interests in your own right  #8212; talk those up! It #8217;s sexy and adorable to see someone with a zest for life, and if it #8217;s in unfamiliar topics (as long as their relatively accessible and don #8217;t seem *too* weird), all the better. Seriously.</TEXT>

I have a few days to work on my bike this year before heading out and wanted to get some proper BRIGHT lights. What (bright) lights do you use and/or love? Looking for brightness, ease of setup, hardiness, and long lasting battery. My priority is high visibility rather than a complex light setup. I have a 12v battery I can use to power them if an external battery pack is needed. Can't wait to see your ideas. Thanks!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Playa recipe time!</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-08-16 23:13:30</DATE>
    <TEXT>Gathering inspiration for favorite playa recipes for the second half of the week when fresh veggies and meat are gone. We will be out there for two weeks so we're looking for meal inspo with shelf stable/canned foods. We have access to a limited camp kitchen (Coleman camping stove, spices, coolers, and an oven in someone's shitty RV). Looking for ease of prep and cleanup, fillingness, general yumminess and if possibly, healthiness (but by week two we are less picky). Please share the best you've got!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I actually have a Mongolian SIM I might be able to dig up, I was there about 10 months ago. I will look and message you if I find it. If I don't, you should definitely buy there, not in NYC, although it's a bit of a pain. Do you have a host or friend or colleague who speaks Mongolian who can help you? I had to go to a few places and it wasn't easy to get the SIM activated, and then when it was activated, loading it was also a bit of a struggle. MobiCOM is the way to go. There's a big mall in downtown UB, on the second floor they have a place that will sell you SIM cards and data. There is also a small shop on your way out of UB by the veterinary supply shop and the small grocery store. Definitely have a Mongolian show you how to load minutes and data when you need to. I ended up having to use people's phones I came across. You should know that outside UB (and even in UB) most people don't speak English.</TEXT>

What is a fun way to use phenibut recreationally and safely? Increase the dose? Add something else?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Newly "disabled" burner looking for suggestions for playa-friendly mobility vehicles</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-08-18 23:34:57</DATE>
    <TEXT>I am heading to the playa this week, and just sprained my ankle badly  #8211; #160;I have a torn ligament. Criminy. I am getting a temporary disabled placard from my doctor for the event. I am looking for recommendations for small, preferably electric, playa-friendly mobility vehicles. (I believe the usual DMV restrictions won't apply to me since I have a temporary ADA placard.) I know a Rascal-type thing would be the best but I can't buy one of those, too expensive. What's looking most appealing are those Razor pocket quads made for kids  #8211; #160;they have a 120-lb weight limit but I weigh 115 lbs so I think it's okay, although it may sink into the unpacked playa (will need to just avoid). Have you guys ever seen one of those out there and if so, how did it perform? Any other bright ideas? PS: I know there are mobility camps like Hot Wheels but the intention of those is for temporary use of their rigs and I need something more or less full time.</TEXT>

I #8217;m also thinking of later in the week when you can #8217;t ride at night anymore bc it #8217;s too crowded  #8212; not sure a little scooter would be that helpful but for some reason it seems easier. Biking in a crowd really isn #8217;t possible but on a little kids quad? Doesn #8217;t seem so bad.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>What is the legality around covered windows when driving in an RV?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-08-19 07:00:38</DATE>
    <TEXT>My husband and I own an old kinda crappy RV we've taken out to the desert for about 6 years thus far (so, not one of the nicer, newer ones -- it's a 1980 Ford model with silly decals on the side from the previous owner). We inherited it from another burner and it already had pre-cut reflective window shades affixed to all the windows to keep the sun and heat out in the morning. The rear windows are covered, the side windows in the back of the RV itself, and the small windows in the loft. The only uncovered windows are the windshield and the side windows in the cab. We have driven this thing around with covered windows for 6 years (both on and off playa  #8211; not much but we've taken a couple road trips in it) with no issue. Now that I am hearing about all the traffic stops on 447, I am a rethinking the covered windows thing. Anyone know the legality of driving with covered windows in an RV? Since they're secured nicely I would rather not remove them if it doesn't increase the chances of being pulled over.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My husband and I own an old RV we've driven for about 6 years. We go on 1-2 road trips a year. It has reflective window shades affixed to the rear and side windows; the only uncovered windows are the windshield and the side windows in the cab. What is the legality of this?

    <TEXT>Is it possible for you to stay for tear down? If so, that really shouldn't be a problem. Just make sure to talk to the camp lead, express your honest regrets about not being able to help with anything pre-event, and let them know you will be there through tear down. If you can't help with tear down, that is a little iffier -- we generally don't like people camping with us who can't make it for build or tear down (which for us means staying through the end of Sunday), but we make exceptions. Talk honestly with the camp lead, express that you'd like to camp with them but are hesitant with your time limitation, and ask them what they think. If they say it's all good, ask what you can do to be maximally helpful while you're there (and then do it!). It's cool you're even asking this, BTW, lots of folks wouldn't.</TEXT>
