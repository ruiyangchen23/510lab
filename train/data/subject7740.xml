    <TEXT>The idea of 5/3/1 seems incredibly appealing - I've ran PPL programs, but on a cut they get incredibly tiresome and I'm teetered out by the end of a workout. With 5/3/1 (triumvirate) it's minimal volume with high intensity. Doesn't this make the most sense to run on a cut or am I just being lazy? I don't make linear progress on PPL anymore (for most exercises at least), and I have lifted on and off (but still fairly consistently) for a while, so I feel I could handle 5/3/1. Thoughts? Those of you who have done it? Seen others do it? I tried to make this a text post but I'm new to Reddit and don't have enough karma or whatever?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It may sound counterproductive but most people's maintenance calories are above 1200. I've found eating @ maintenance when sick helped me feel better, recover quicker, and have a ton of energy when I got better. And it doesn't delete your progress it just stalls it (since you're not gaining or losing). Feel better.</TEXT>

EVERYONE is looking to meet new people in college. Everyone's in the same boat as you. Just have a smile on your face, lower your shoulders, relax your breathing (write this down and refer to it if need be) and introduce yourself to people. Everyone's trying to make friends, and it will be easier than you think, I promise.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Help on protein pancakes</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-02-21 21:55:08</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi Fitmeals, This morning I tried making the protein pancakes. First off, let me start by saying the texture and the outside skin/shell was on point. The taste was pretty nasty though. What are some things I can do to improve? Here's my recipe: * 1 cup of greek yogurt * 1/2 cup of blended rolled oats * 2 egg whites * 1 egg * vanilla extract (1 tsp) * Baking soda (1/3 tsp) It tasting overwhelmingly yogurty. It's really close, and the texture was fine though - cooked up like any good pancake. I'm very calorie-minded so the substitutions should try to keep protein/macros good. I'm thinking of adding strawberries mashed up into the pancake as they are very low calorie. Thanks and all advice is appreciated.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;ve looked into RPT on a cut. From what it seems like there really is not much volume at all. Do you find your gym sessions only take like 20-30 minutes? Maybe I #8217;m missing the point here, but I just don #8217;t understand how it could be effective. The 31minutes AMA guy even came out after the fact saying he was spinning his wheels. I #8217;m really curious what you guys think and how many people actually do it. Thanks!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Switching to a lean bulk - need advice</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-08-28 21:09:10</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi friends, I recently got off a pretty long cut (dropped down to 12% bf) @ 145lbs, eating around 1800 Cals a day. I am trying to transition to a bulk (but slowly, don #8217;t want to lose my abs) and realized all I #8217;ve been doing is RPT. I am looking to increase the volume, and minimize rest times. I was wondering if you guys had any programs to share or advice? Thank you!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So that #8217;s around a 250cal surplus daily (250 x 4 x 7 = 2lbs/month gained). What #8217;s your particular routine or programming I could find? Any resources would be appreciated.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi guys, I have read through a bit on what Martin has to say about bulking and it seems like a 4x a week routine WITH hitting every muscle group 2x a week is the way to go. My only issue is i don #8217;t know how to squeeze that all in. Guidance or posting your routine(s) and rep ranges are appreciated!</TEXT>
