    <TEXT>I've read a bunch of spiderman growing up and a couple of story arcs here in there but for the most part I'm all about the movies. The MCU did you get me back into the comics and I've been trying to read them a lot more though. I do love learning the mythos and history of each character whether or not I've read their comics. I own the marvel encyclopedia and it's fun to flip through that as well as Wikipedia and discover new things. Of the handful comics I have read though, I have to say winter soldier is by far my favorite.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So when I plug my headphone amplifier into my interface via the headphone jack, the sound will only come out of my left ear. But when I unplug the quarter inch jack just barely, then I can hear through both channels. I've tried a different cable and another headphone amplifier but the same think it's happening. When I plug the headphones directly into the interface though I can hear through both channels no problem. Any ideas? My setup is in the album. https://imgur.com/a/0KuAa</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's not that harsh. Honestly the evaluation was fun. It's basically a bunch of people in the sound room listening to someone who is very prominent in the industry. The guy we had was super fun and approachable. The first half of it is going over the entire industry and learning a few basic techniques. Then they have you and everyone else get behind a microphone and read a few lines. I think if you put in an genuine effort the odds of them dropping you are slim. I definitely wasn't very good at the evaluation. These are the exact notes they gave me. "Here are some of your strengths: It was clear that you understood the general concepts of V.O. delivery that we discussed during class -- this is an important skill, since these concepts are a vital part of learning voice-over technique. And here are some things to work on . . . You will need to work on some general newcomer challenges. This includes the basic concepts worked on in class (using volume, pitch, etc). Further training usually helps work these issues out. Your reads lacked variety. Work on changing up your delivery to keep your audience interested. There were times when you didn't smile, so work on smiling more (and, if the copy calls for it, smiling more consistently). People can hear a smile in your voice." Yeah it may seem scary but what criticism isn't? I think it's worth it to get it down right honest opinion. Hell, even if they say it's not for you, that doesn't mean you have to stop pursuing it. You'll just have to go about it differently. And at the very least, you'll learn quite a lot at the evaluation which is definitely helpful anyways.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not dumb at all. Lots of quadriplegics have muscle spasms constantly anyways. Some more severe than others. Everything definitely feels numb. As far as putting a hotplate on my leg or feeling pain, my body feels it but I don't. It Triggers what's called autonomic dysreflexia. So basically since I can't feel it my body's response is to raise my blood pressure very high to the point where I get really bad headaches and I get cold sweats. And this usually doesn't go away till I find the cause of it.</TEXT>

Then if all the poop doesn't come out someone has to reach in with their finger, which is called digital stim, and scoop the rest out. Then we roll the chair into the shower and someone bathes me.

Ordinarily I do physical therapy in Baltimore at Kennedy krieger Institute but I'm doing it now in Richmond as a test run in case I get into VCU. The exoskeleton is good because it's good for my bones by weight bearing. I also use a FES bike for my legs. I attach electrodes to my muscles and it fires as I ride the bike.

    <TEXT>I don't where I have no feeling. This is actually a major issue. Because I can't feel pain my body's natural responses something called autonomic dysreflexia. Basically if something is going on my body can feel it but I can't. So my body will raise my blood pressure and I will get the cold sweats. I've had my blood pressure as high as 220/150. This will give me excruciatingly painful headaches. Usually the common causes are clogged catheter or bowel obstruction or even an ingrown toenail. I had to go to the hospital once because I had appendicitis and didn't know it and that's what was sitting off my autonomic dysreflexia</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Quite a few things. I have a strong opinion of inclines now. I have to be constantly aware of my body now. I have to do what's called weight shifts a lot. Basically my chair will lean back to 45 #176; angle to relieve pressure off of my ass. If I don't I'm susceptible to a pressure sore. I've had one last year it was the worst thing ever. You can feel your butt getting numv when you sit too long but I can't which is why have to do pressure releases. This also means that I have to be turned when I sleep in bed. So in the middle the night someone will turn me to make sure I don't have constant pressure on one spot. Another thing is, and this is me in particular this doesn't apply to everyone, I can't sweat. So I have to drink a lot of water and be careful in the heat. If I'm outside I usually have one with me to pour on my head to cool me down. And of course going to the bathroom which I answered in another comment</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Of course I feel despair. I still do to this day. It can be tough looking at your past life and thinking what could've been. It can be hard to adapt to a new life. I have plenty of dark days where I feel like I'm not good enough or strong enough for this life. I also hate that other people have to see me like this. Being in a wheelchair can also make you feel extremely insecure. It can feel like I'm a burden and it also sucks asking for help especially since I was so independent before. I am happy in life but there are a lot of times where I'm not. This is something I'm trying to change about myself. A lot of times I feel unaccomplished and like I'm doing nothing with my life and that I'm letting everyone down. Luckily like I've said another comments though I have the most amazing support group. Between my family and friends, They are really what keep me going. I want to be somebody just for them because they've done so much for me. Which is why recently I've put in a lot of effort to better myself. they are really what keep me going and give me hope. They believe in me. To help disabled people, just be there for them when they need it and treat them like any other person</TEXT>

    <DATE>2017-12-22 19:42:19</DATE>
    <TEXT>So here's my problem. I'm editing a video podcast. I recorded all the audio using Adobe audition and recording the video using a gopro. Last time I did this I edited the audio and moved over to premier And synced it up Manually by moving it a little bit to the left or a little bit to the right which was a pain. I'm just trying to find an easier way to do this. When I recorded on the go pro to I forgot to adjust the settings so it recorded in 12 minutes increments videos. So I just put them next to each other on the sequence so no problem. Should I edit the audio first before syncing up or do I import the audio to premier, sync, then edit in audition? I tried highlighting all the things on the sequence and right clicking then go to synchronize but it wouldn't let me. I have no idea what I'm doing! Any help would be appreciated!</TEXT>
