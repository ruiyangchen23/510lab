    <TEXT>I can have basic conversations in Spanish. Talk about my day and the things I like and make some what complex sentences with a few mistakes here and there. I studied for 1 to 2 hours a day for the past 8 months though, and I use other things to help me. I use lingq.com to read things and help me pronounce words correctly because reading is very important once you have a basic grasp on the language. Then you also have to speak more so I use conversationexchange.com to find Mexicans to skype with. This helps a lot I have learned so much from people in Mexico. Then I watch youtube videos in Spanish all the time constantly focusing on how native speakers speak. This helps my pronunciation and with more fluent speech. I can't tell you how I would be If I just used duolingo. Duolingo is amazing but it will just teach you the basics. How well you speak write read and listen is all up to you and what you use to supplement your duolingo course material. All this being said If you study your tree very well I think most people come out with an A2 level on average. Which depends if you have experience with learning foreign languages or not and many other variables. Language learning is really difficult to measure I think.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's the fluency meter. It never reaches 100% because duolingo can't make you 100% fluent in a language. The maximum it can get to is about 65%, depending on how often you practice. I got 48%, and can still increase it if I practice more.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Seriously? Cuba's GDP has grown annually by an average rate of 4.74% since 1994. In the years from the capitalist crisis until now (2008-2012) it has grown by an average of 3.6% - compare this to imperialist Britain, where it has 'grown' by an average of, ahem, -4.4%. Unlike in the imperialist countries Cuba's growth has not been sustained off plundering the world and squeezing the working class. Even in the worst years of the Special Period - the years following the destruction of the USSR, where 35% of GDP and 80% of trade was lost practically overnight - it didn't shut down one hospital or old person's home, nobody starved, and nobody was made homeless. And this is in the context of a 53-year blockade implemented by the US which had cost Cuba over $236bn by January 2011. Cuba has a 'high' HDI index - 0.78. It is the only country in the world to have sustainable development as measured by the WWF. Its healthcare system is universally understood as one of the best in the world - it sends more doctors overseas than the entire WHO. And this is in the context of it being a small Caribbean island which was as unequal and poor as any other before the revolution. If you want to see what Cuban socialism really means, put these basic facts in the context of a Jamaica (whose post-crisis GDP has shrunk by an annual average of -1.1%, has 17.6% of people living under the national poverty line, and is facing IMF-imposed austerity measures which include a 20% real-terms cut in wage) or a Haiti (where 78% of people live on less than $2 a day). It has economic issues it needs to resolve - an increased productivity to combat the dual currency, for example - but these problems would not even exist were it not for the US blockade, and it is already working on resolving them. To argue that it is completely stagnant is completely ridiculous by anyone's measure.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Is it weird that I used to have an imaginary sister when I was young?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-02-16 18:10:24</DATE>
    <TEXT>I am a male, currently 18 years old and I am the oldest sibling among my two brothers. When I was younger (about 8 years to 15 years old), I used to imagine that I had a sister (she was about 5 years older than me). Whenever I was feeling sad, depressed, lonely, angry, etc., I would always pretend she was there right next to me. She would smile and comfort me and tell me everything was going to be okay. She would always play with me, hug me and when I was feeling down she would make it seem like there was nothing to worry about. She was the best friend I never had when I was young. Nobody knew about her, I just kept her to myself. I never really *wanted* to have an older sister, I just thought it would have been nice to have one since I only have brothers. I just wanted to ask if this is weird or if it's normal? Please be honest. Thanks.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Help! I'm starting to have really vivid dreams after starting to meditate.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-05-27 05:03:59</DATE>
    <TEXT>Is this normal? Does anyone else experience this as a result of meditation? I've been using Headspace every day (~20 min) for the past 2 weeks and in the last few days I've been having really vivid HD dreams. When I have them they seem to last for a really long time, like I am actually living a real life in the dream and then suddenly wake up. They're also more memorable. Normally I forget my dreams the moment I wake up, but these ones actually stay in my mind. They also feel very... um.... "euphoric" - like the complete opposite of a nightmare. Is this supposed to happen?</TEXT>

    <DATE>2018-06-21 21:21:24</DATE>
    <TEXT>Meditation is difficult to talk about because it isn #8217;t a  #8220;thing #8221;. It #8217;s a changing experience that is unique to each person. The more we talk about meditation, the further away we move from the essence of the experience. To know that it #8217;s not a fixed experience and that it is unique to each person means that there is no fixed point. For some people this can feel unsettling or even a little scary. But it gives us a huge amount of freedom because there is no right or wrong meditation. There can be no fixed opinion about the meditation because everything is different and always changing. It is in that change we find freedom.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>When applying mindfulness to everyday life, have the sense that the body and the mind are allowing the action, rather than forcing the action.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-06-22 16:14:24</DATE>
    <TEXT>This is best demonstrated in sport when you see somebody in a state of flow. You can also see it in music, in video games, in art and so many different areas of life. When somebody is in that state of flow, there #8217;s no possible way they could think their way to that performance. They are simply in that moment. They #8217;re not thinking about it. They #8217;re not getting in their own way. They are simply allowing something to happen. You don #8217;t have to be a professional in any of these areas to experience this. It can be something as simple as walking down the street. It #8217;s a sense of allowing the body to move gracefully, easily and effortlessly rather than trying to apply effort and make something happen. If we can start to bring a little bit of that quality into each activity we do, we will naturally start to find a much greater sense of ease and flow. Not only in the body, but also in the mind.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There is no better or worse experience of meditation. There is simply the experience of now. It #8217;s quite common when we #8217;re learning meditation to discuss it with other people. Some of that can be helpful because it reminds us that we #8217;re all on this shared journey together. But as we speak to others we may start to wonder whether we #8217;re doing something right or doing something wrong. We may start to compare ourselves, and that can be unhelpful because we #8217;re not looking to compare any aspect of meditation to another person, not even to a previous experience we #8217;ve had ourselves or a future experience we hope to have. We are simply experiencing it in that moment. It unfolds so differently for each person. Discussing meditation with others can be helpful. It #8217;s important to discuss these things with others. But not to compare and to always remember that every one of us will experience it in a slightly different way.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You might feel that because you meditate on a regular basis, that #8217;s the time of the day where the magic happens. That #8217;s when you #8217;re the most attentive and focused. You may find that throughout the rest of the day, you don #8217;t necessarily apply a lot of awareness. But we #8217;re looking to create a sense of stability across each 24-hour period. You might not be very aware when you #8217;re asleep, and that #8217;s okay. But during our waking hours, apply the same level of attentiveness to each moment of the day. When you #8217;re walking down the street and see yourself getting distracted by something, you recognise it, let it go and come back to the feeling of the soles of the feet against the floor. Perhaps you #8217;re reading something, you get distracted, realise you #8217;re distracted, and in that moment, you come back to the taste of the food. Each of these activities throughout the day provide an opportunity for us to cultivate that quality of awareness so that we don #8217;t just experience it in one short period of time of the day. We get to experience it in every moment of our life.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No matter how much you try to supress challenging emotions, they will always find a way to the surface. It #8217;s better to make them a part of your journey. As we sit in our meditation and go about our everyday life, it #8217;s tempting to resist painful, challenging and difficult thoughts. We might think that if we can push them away for long enough or hard enough, they #8217;ll eventually disappear. But this flow of thought, emotion and feeling will only be taken in a different direction if we resist it. We can #8217;t escape it or run away from it. If it does go in a different direction, it simply becomes internalised. It becomes a part of our subconscious thinking and even our physicality. Through meditation, we learn to step back and to see the thoughts and feelings clearly. In seeing them more clearly, we understand that we #8217;re not our thoughts or feelings. We can experience them. We can feel them. And at the same time, we can learn to let them go.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2018-06-26 14:56:21</DATE>
    <TEXT>Like a flowing river, the journey of meditation does not have an end. At some stage we might flow out into the ocean and experience more spaciousness, but the journey continues nonetheless. Very often in life we begin things with an idea of a destination, of learning something until we master it. Meditation is a little bit different in that sense. The truth is that there is no end to the journey of the mind. When beginning meditation, we experience it in a small and limited way. It #8217;s not that the mind is limited. It #8217;s just that our perspective of it is quite limited in some way. We might initially see the mind as a swimming pool. As we continue to meditate, we start to see that there #8217;s a continuous sense of flow, so then the mind is more like a river. And then in time, the more we sit, the more we start to experience a sense of spaciousness. It #8217;s the equivalent of the water running from a stream and out into the ocean. The water in the ocean is still flowing. It #8217;s still moving. It #8217;s just that our perspective of it has changed and we start to experience not only our mind, but also the world around us in a very different way.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> #8220;Self #8221; and  #8220;other #8221; are not two different things. They #8217;re not separate. As we sit and observe the mind, hopefully over time we start to experience a bit more clarity and calm. We start to get a bit more understanding of the mind. Although that understanding is of our own experience, it #8217;s also of the human experience. We #8217;re not only getting an understanding of ourselves, but we #8217;re also starting to see how and why other people think, say and do the things that they do. And in that same way, we #8217;re also training our empathy and compassion. We #8217;re learning how to not only be more kinder and gentle to ourselves, but also how to be more patient, understanding and tolerant towards others because ultimately there is no separation between self and others. If there is kindness in our mind, it doesn #8217;t matter whether we direct our attention towards ourselves or towards others. If the inherent quality is kindness in that moment, then kindness will be the expression and the result. When we sit with that intention each time we meditate it not only benefits ourselves, but also benefits those around us.</TEXT>

So as much as possible, using meditation to approach life lightly and skilfully. Not trying to be a different kind of person or trying to live a different kind of way. Instead, simply being present and applying that quality of mindfulness of being present to each moment of your day no matter what you #8217;re doing and no matter how you #8217;re living your life.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is a challenging idea because even if we feel as though we #8217;re doing it free from any expectation, there is nonetheless a little bit of expectation. We might think that the very least somebody could do is be grateful for our kindness, perhaps show some appreciation, or at the very least be polite in some way. I remember when this child came up to me and asked for a pen. I had a spare pen on me and gave it to him, and he just took it and turned around and ran away. In my mind, I was thinking  #8220;wow that #8217;s really not very grateful #8221; and then I realised well actually that wasn #8217;t the point. The point was to simply give something that at that time had value to me. To give it to someone else who needed it more. It really didn #8217;t matter that it had nothing to do with me. It was more the thinking that I took away afterwards. So often in life we do these things with good intentions and yet still underneath there is an expectation that we deserve something in return. As we train the mind in meditation more and more, we understand that the point is to simply express kindness, to express compassion, and to allow nature to look after the rest.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>As we spend time with another person, are we seeing them as they are? Or are we judging them against what we would like them to be?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-06-30 18:37:52</DATE>
    <TEXT>This could apply to someone we recently met, to any type of relationship or perhaps a colleague of some kind. The temptation is to see that person against an idea of what we would like them to be. Rather than allowing that person to simply be who they are and express themselves in that moment, there #8217;s a part of us that #8217;s almost like a background commentary editing that person. Perhaps the things they say or the things that they do. It might be the way that they say them or the way that they do them. In our mind, this commentary is essentially getting in the way of the relationship with that person. Not only is it disrupting it for ourselves, but it #8217;s also disrupting it for the other person. We #8217;re no longer giving that person permission to be who they are. We #8217;re wanting to change that person. So as much as possible in life, try to recognise and realise when that #8217;s happening. Dropping that thought, dropping that editing, that judgemental narrative in the mind and just noticing what happens. Noticing what happens how we experience that other person and how our own experience of that person changes in that moment.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>It #8217;s impossible for certainty and curiosity to exist in the same moment. To discover new things, let go of the known and be open to every possibility.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-07-01 17:05:53</DATE>
    <TEXT>As challenging as this may sound as an idea, it doesn #8217;t mean we need to leave behind our old ideas or lose them forever. It #8217;s as though just temporarily we #8217;re putting them down and saying  #8220;okay, in this moment, I don #8217;t know #8221;. There #8217;s something powerful about not knowing. It #8217;s often seen as a weakness, however in not knowing there is a limitless sense of openness. When we #8217;re open to any idea, we see things differently. We stop looking at them in comparison and in side by side with something else. We see them in and of themselves. With that curiosity, there #8217;s a sense of discovery. It #8217;s not that we will necessarily embrace the things that we look at. But at least we seen them honestly. We look at them in and of themselves, rather than compared to other things and in judgement next to something else. At the end of it we could put it down and return to our previous way of thinking. But typically, over time, that way of thinking isn #8217;t fixed. If we really apply this approach, then our way of thinking changes and evolves. It becomes infused in some way by this new perspective. A willingness to be more curious in our life.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>It #8217;s the thinking mind that wants to become bigger, better or special in the world. The other part, our awareness, has no such desire.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-07-02 13:35:52</DATE>
    <TEXT>This is an interesting idea as we sit to meditate and watch the thoughts coming and going. Awareness is voiceless. It #8217;s simply witnesses and observes. It has no goal or desire to change anything, to be something more or to be something better. It simply witnesses life as it unfolds. At the same time, we need the thinking mind  #8211; the mind that plans and strives. That mind is typically quite busy. It #8217;s trying to change and reach for something bigger and better. There are times in our lives when that is entirely appropriate and even necessary. However, so often when we think about ourselves in that way, it #8217;s not very helpful. Rather than being happy and content with ourselves as we are, we #8217;re always trying to be somebody different. So much that we can #8217;t even experience that sense of contentment in the moment right now. In learning to rest in awareness, we rely less on the thinking mind  #8211; the mind that #8217;s always reaching for something else. Instead, we start to appreciate the value of resting right here in this moment right now.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Sometimes meditation is described as escapism but, in truth, everyday distraction is the real form of escape.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-07-03 17:02:47</DATE>
    <TEXT>In being present, meditation is by the very definition the opposite of escape. If we really think about what meditation is, it #8217;s about awareness of what #8217;s happening in this moment right now. It takes courage to sit with the mind as it is. Even when we #8217;re experiencing pain and discomfort of some kind in the mind. To sit with that rather than to chose distraction. It #8217;s easy to get lost in our phones, TVs, books rather than be present with an uncomfortable thought or feeling. Even when we #8217;re engaged in those distraction, we might still experience a gentle simmering of it still present underneath. It #8217;s not being attended to and it #8217;s not going away. We can #8217;t make it go away. We might forget about it temporarily, but at some stage we #8217;ll have to come back to that feeling. But in sitting to meditate, we create the conditions to not only experience that thought, but to understand it. To understand the feeling, and maybe to even make friends with it so that we no longer feel overwhelmed and swept away by it. Not all escapism is bad, but just notice the inclination and temptation to run away from challenging thoughts. And at that moment, chose to sit with them and just notice what happens when you allow the mind to be as it is.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>It's not that the quality of meditation itself is strange in any way. It's just so different from the way we live the rest of our life.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-07-04 15:25:53</DATE>
    <TEXT>Meditation can feel unnatural at first. This has nothing to do with the experience of meditation, but rather the comparison of that experience to the rest of our existence. Most of us are living very busy lives and have so many different things going on. So many different responsibilities. The temptation is to always be involved, always be engaged in doing. Even when we don #8217;t have anything to do, we #8217;re thinking about what we need to do or what we could have done. This experience of stepping out of all that and simply being present, still with the body and at ease with the mind can feel like an alien experience. It #8217;s not that the quality of meditation itself is strange in any way. It #8217;s just so different from the way we live the rest of our life. The beauty of it is that if we train in it consistently, we can start to bring that experience into the other areas of our life, so that all the busyness, the doing doesn #8217;t feel so stressful. It doesn #8217;t feel so hectic. Instead, it has a quality of ease about it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I know it may seem a bit  #8220;shameful #8221; to copy others, but why don #8217;t poor and undeveloped countries just copy exactly what the rich and successful countries do? A country isn #8217;t going declare war on you just because you #8217;re copying them. They might even take it as a compliment or as a sign of respect. By this, I mean everything: the laws, the culture, the infrastructure, the education system, etc. Poor countries don #8217;t just have less money, they also do things differently. They chose to be different and do things in their own way. For example: a poor country is usually more religious and has stricter punishments for breaking the law (except for countries like Saudi Arabia because of their oil supplies). I #8217;m not saying that if they suddenly mimicked let #8217;s say Norway or Denmark, they would suddenly become developed, but surely it would help and put them in the right direction?</TEXT>
