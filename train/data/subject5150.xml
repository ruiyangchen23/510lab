    <TEXT>Most of the communist cult of personnality isn't about the people as leader, but more as thinker and/or revolutionnaries, that's why there are lots of icons of poeple like of Karl Marx or Rosa Luxemburg, but none of Brejnev/Kruchev/Gorbachev, even though the first held barely (if not none for some) any political power. Also take in account the fact that communism have a real and dense history and culture, [with songs and books in every language](\https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0O9hSjYF2Hc) so obiously there are myths building around people and events. Also even though liberal democracy claim to oppose cults of personnalities, The United $tates still have it's founders carved in a f*ck*ng mountain and France  amp; the United-Kingdom still praise respectivly De Gaule and Churchill as heros and savior</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's a ultra-reactionnary system that aims to "save society from it's decadence", the means to do so are eliminations of political opponents on one side, and ethnic cleansing/eugenism on the other. The ideology promote a cult of order (the police, the army, the state, anyone wearing a uniform really) and purity (racial and religious) It is carried by the higher/middle class, who try keep their power during economic crisis (Lenin described it as decaying capitalism, because it appears as a symptom of unstability), post WW1 crisis for Italy and 1929 krash for Germany. Despite names such as National-Socialism it has nothing socialist in it, it's corporalist (not liberal) as it actively promotes monopolies instead of free market. I had my final exam on this exact question last week so i was prepared, hope this help comrade.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>But why wouldn't they work ? If you are not forced to take any shit job because you'll starve otherwise, and can take any job without thinking about financial consequence, you can take any job you love. Everybody, when they are young have a dream job, but can' make it true because being an artist is too uncertain money-wise or because they can' afford to take the studies to become a lawyer or a doctor. A lot of kids actually wish they coulkd grow up to do manual labor (my nephew dreams of working on construction sites), they are only disliked as job because of the alienation. You'll never find a kid who'll say "I wish i could do absolutly nothing all day, because i'm sure that won't become boring after a while !"</TEXT>

It also counts all the eastern front casualties in WW2, even though it was the germans who declared war. So every citizen that fell under the nazi genocidal war machine ? Communism's fault.

    <TEXT>Look at a map of the USSR before the annexion of eastern Poland, notice how close to the border the biggest cities are. Leningrad. Stalingrad and Moscow represent by far the vast majority of the soviet industrial power, even most medium-large cities (i.e Smolensk or Kiev) are also on the western side (and even closer to the border). Everybody knew that the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact was a pragmatic move and wouldn't last, so they needed to prepare for war with the germans, the first order was to get the most valuable land of country (russian/ukrainian/ land)the furthest possible of germany. Look at a map showing the operation barbarossa execution, this buffer actually saved them.</TEXT>

To give an example: housing. Everywhere there are more vacant houses than people, why is looking for a home so hard ? Because is someone hoarding a whole street worth of houses decides to put them to higg prices, all of the people who could have lived there must fight for affordable house where only one family can live, living the other on the street.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hitler used (and clearly says to have done so in his diaries) a lot of socialism related imagery to try and appeal to the mass. In 1920-30's Germany socialism and communism were really popular (look at the 1918 [spartacist uprising](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spartacist_uprising) ). He put the term in his party's name, and for example, used red as the party's flag primary color to make people curious about it. If you look at history, it is obvious that it was a ruse and that the reich was in nothing socialist : Privatization of the industry (Krupp, Volkswagen), of transportation (Highways (Reichautobahn)). [The night of the long knives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_of_the_Long_Knives)] was a purge of all of the members who were socialist to some extent. People who claims to be actual fascist socialist (nazi/nazbol) are just straight-up fascists using the same ruse as hitler to fool unsuspecting liberals/socdem into joining them.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Guerilla warfare is nothing like regular fighting. Most times it's even the rebels (without proper training or supply) that wins. What you need is experience, knowledge of your surroundings and the ability to make decisions as an individual/small team, wich are the opposite of what is required by a regular army. That is what gives them the edge.</TEXT>

But to still answer your question, a big part of it is trough lobbism (bribing politicals to stop/pass laws that would harm/benefit part of the private sector). Another big share is with the use of media, in most countries, even is there are dozens of TV channels or newspaper (that one would think brings diversity of opinion) are actually owned by a few people/company.

    <TEXT>This very question shows why the very existence of wage labour doesn't make sense. This is why we oppose it, because it would imply that we can estimate value for priceless things (how much should a doctor be paid, a teacher, or even parents at home who contributes to society by hundreds of hours of social labour) If you want to learn more about this, this will be one of the few time i would recommend [*The Conquest of bread*](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Conquest_of_Bread) by Piotr Kropotkin (the first chapter i believe, but it's rather short so read it entierly)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>When communists says they are against religions, lot of people think that it means to be communist you have to be a dedicated atheist (and sure a lot of us are). What it actually means, is that we oppose **structural** religion, because if there is a hierachy, it is a mean of oppression. So no: -no any kind of theocracy (califat, papal state or whatever the dalai lama wants to call his tibet). -No megachurches (they are the modern embodiment of religion used against it's own moral). All exemples of "why religion is bad" is an exemple of it used by powerful individual for personnal gain. As of itself it is very beneficial to society, it motivates such grandeur in all arts, unites so much people in celebrations and so on. No, being religious and communist are not mutually exclusive, quite the opposite if you're not a zealous b*tch.

Yes there is a consensus, but if you made your research you would know that the sources these """scholars""" used are books written by ukrainian nazis who fled to the us, such as "Black Deeds of the Kremlin" (Which honours collavorators, and uses fake photos as i said already) You can't just say somethibg happenned because nazi scolars said so without bringing any proof. That's why nobody likes anarchists, because you give in fascist propaganda recycled by liberals because you can't accept that the ussr was succesful.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The difference between the feudalism-capitalism and the capitalism-socialism transition, is that the first one keep a bourgeois state. Things were rebranded, but the class struggle is the same, as it has always been (Barons became Bosses and serfs became workers). A glaring example of this is when you check the past history of many notable families, lot of them were aristocrats, they lost the official power from feudalism, but kept everything else since unlike in the french revolution, feudal properties were not revoked, and kept their lands. This is a good question, better than "is passive reformism into socialism possible ?" as it forces to see the perpetuation of the class struggle. If you want to learn more, red the manifesto if you haven't already (the first chapter and the exposition of the concept of class struggle) and [*Reform or Revolution* by Rosa Luxemburg](https://www.marxists.org/archive/luxemburg/1900/reform-revolution/index.htm), as it is the whole point of the essay to show the inevitability of the revolution.</TEXT>

There is a difference between **private** and **personnal** properties. Personnal property is all your stuff, the appartement you live in, your bike, fridge, clothes and what not. Private property is a factory and the machines it contains, houses for rent, a field for agriculture, a giant residence (like some celebrities' ridiculously big homes) ,etc... The first is yours, legitimately, the possession of the later cannot be justified and is collzctivized.</TEXT>

It is high because you have to count the death from colonialism (wars for the conquest of India by the diffents powers, repression of nationalism, and general exploitation) as they are byproducts of capitalism</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The closest goverments to the textbook definition of technocracy are late 19^th century latin american positivist goverment. These countries were heavily corrupt as the presidents/dictator kept powerful industrial close to them and relied on heavy bureaucracy. Most of the good done was purely pragmatic to devellop a strong corporate economy (massive railroads skipping cities to link mine and factories). I think if we ever technocracies again it would be in Africa because i believe it is the goverment form that allow to transition from a *(neo)*colonial nation to political liberalism (like what happened in Mexico, with the [Porfiriato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Mexico#The_Porfiriato_(1876%E2%80%931910)) and the 1910 revolution)</TEXT>

So after the war when soldiers went back home, there was an increase in population (even if not as strong to the western baby-boom) but agricultural production took way longer to come back up as much of the civilian industry was either destroyed or had been converted to war industry for emergency weapon supply. The demand increased when the offer decreased, past the point of crisis.</TEXT>

Going back to your country after the war takes way longer than leaving for the front, by experience, i know by experience that my great-grandfather took 4 years to go back to france after being deported to Crimea. That's 3500 Km, on the other hand, a soviet feol Moscow fighring in Manchuria has a long 5500 Km to go ... Babies do consume food you twat, the most common baby food in rural areas was to boil wheat in milk... Plus milk from an animal means you need to feed said animal or if it's the mother's milk she needs more food because it is tiring. Of course there is an immaginable amount of destruction, what part of "Systematic mass murder by an advancing army of 4 million nazis" do you fail to understand ? If all the soviets hated the regime, why do the main collaborationist factions only had to barely 50K when there was at least a million partisan ?

    <TEXT>Since our comrade already brought a really good and detailled answer, i won't go in much detail, just wanna expand a tiny bit : The idea that Quebecois nationalism is invalid because it was founded on settler colonialism is ridiculous (united-states ?) and also object a lot of political history as opposed to the british colonial policy (wich sought to repel natives to "make room" for europeans) France settlers and natives [enjoyed much better relations](https://www.google.fr/amp/s/ancestralfindings.com/the-french-and-native-american-relations/amp/), wich was about peaceful coexistance with some cooperation (french offering technologies in exchange for guides for example) that's why there is still a pretty high amount of natives in Quebec. The other point i wanted to make is that Quebec nationalism is one of the few independantist movement in the first world based on radical left-wing nationalism. Compare it with some in Europe (to keep it french let's say Brittany and Corsica), a lot are based around xenophobia and reactionnary nationalism, wich is not the case for most of the Quebecois movements.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You using the word "Holocaust" around like that is bad, and undermining the meaning of the horror it really was. The books you're talking about, on the holodomor are the ones the most influenced by nazi collaborationist who fled after the war. The very concept of the holodomor has first been seen in Hitler's infamous Mein Kampf, as a way to create unrest in Ukraine (wich was already to be seen as part of the german Lebensraum) against the Soviets. The first apparition in the US was in press owned by W.R. Hearst, a nazi-friendly press-magnate. He published a series of articles by Thomas Walker, wich never could prove he made any trips to places where famine took place or deny that the photos he used where real (after they were proven to actually show the 1921-1922 famine). Still, most of the studies you will find will either quote this, or books from R. Conquest written with the help of the "Ukrainian Association of Victims of Russian Communist Terror" wich is actually a cover for letting nazis in the US) as the book makes an hommage to none other that S.Petliura, know for taking active part in pogroms, and R.Shukhevych who took active part in the holocaust as the commander of the Nachtigall Battalion in the german army. Is this enough or do you want me to go in more detail about how you are wrong ?</TEXT>

They are not "ex-nazi" they are nazis, all the people who loved hitler did not went to hating him in 15 secondes after they surendered. They went to the US because the US supported fascism many times (Chile, Spain, Greece, Nicaragua ...) as they hated communism more, and american officials were looking asking for them to discredit the soviets.

    <TEXT>Like in all revolutions, there is a mix of long and short term problem that led to it. The Tsardom of Russia was an absolute monarchy of divine right, the most archaic and oppressive goverment, coming straight up from the 18\^th century. It was so backward it couldn't reform itself so unrest built up over decades ([there was a first attempt at a revolution in 1905](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1905_Russian_Revolution)\]). On the short term, Nikolai II himself, a very reactionnary emperor, did nothing to try and appease the people, even after the 1905 revolution wich he resolved in a bloodbath. Also a an economic crisis that led a massive reduction of pursaching power (\~-75%) for the proletariat wich had to resolved to go back into virtually slavery. And of course, the war. Before the Soviets there was virtually no industry, so the war effort depanded onexpandable soldiers (i once read in a book the story of soldiers who mutined because they were sent to fight ... without ammo for their guns). They were not inept, well the opposite, they would have been very competent rulers ... if they were still in the middle-ages. They didn't actively butcher their own people, they were content to let them die. What ultimately led to their doom was their inability to reform the royal bureaucracy to reduce the weight put on the masses.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't have much time right now so just gonna answer the extra : I think Turkey is in good shape, the far-left is radical and present, and the tension created by Erdogan's administration didn't lead to a rise of far-right movement (unlike most of the western world sadly). I think his death before the end of his mandate might just spark a lot of unrest. Otherwise Venezuela, a US intervention could very well force the country to go all the way to socialism as a reaction to the reaction.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No, i know a lot of comrades with a very strong faith in their religious belief. When communism oppose religion as the "opium of the masses", it is as way of oppression and hierachy. We oppose structured religion (theocracies, justifying oppression on religion excuses, etc...), so no pope, no califate, no monarchy of divine right, no god-emperor. The bad aspects of religion comes from powerful people using it with ill intent: war not for the faith but for the interest of the nobles, racism and hatred spread to hide the real oppressor. [Here are some exemple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_communism) of religious communist movement. I personally believe that once communism is achieved, all would become atheist as religion would loose more and more importance and transition into being a purely cultural thing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The crisis itself is a product of US imperialism, it occured when Venezuela was nationalizing their oil fields and investing massively into it. The US decided alongside Saudi Arabia to drop the prices to destroy the venezuelan economy. The effect of said crisis have been wildly exagerated, [most shortage are artificial](https://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/Blaming-Socialism-US-Media-Distorts-Venezuelas-Food-Crisis-20170223-0053.html), people creating fake shortages to inflate selling prices of various goods. The country is being actively sabotaged from the inside, by hoarding as said earlier, [destruction of goods](https://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/Venezuela-Protesters-Set-40-Tons-of-Subsidized-Food-on-Fire-20170630-0017.html), [extraction of paper money](https://www.insightcrime.org/news/brief/paraguay-seizes-25-tons-of-venezuela-currency/).

    <TEXT>Across history the US exploited every opportunity to destroy any country with socialist intent, why would they spare Venezuela ? Plus crashing oil prices has already been used by the OPEC in 1979 as a mean of pressuring world politics. I agree that relying less of oil explotation would have prevented this problem, but it can't be denied that the US has spent countless time fiddleling in other country's affair, especially if they have socialist tendencies, or are in the Americas ...</TEXT>

It's all about materialism. An anarchist revolution would implie dismantling the state apparatus without abolishing the material condition that led to it's existence (the appropration by the few of the many). That's why there is socialism, wich collevtize property, before reaching communism.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There were fascist states after 1945 (funny, they were supported by the US). Spain stayed fascist until the 1970's (because they stayed neutral in WW2), same as Portugal (even if the Estado Novo being fascist can still be kinda questionnable). The US still supported the chilean coup against Salvador Allende (provided weapons and intels) the same way they did with the greek military junta after the civil war. Not forgetting that most of the regime they backed in the Cold War (South Vietnam/Korea for example) were also military juntas that could very well in a broader definition of fascism. But to come back to the main topic : I think it's kinda hard to talk about modern fascism, because every western nation is on the same slippery slope of an Overton window skewing to the right. The fact that's it's really much slower of a transition than in the 1930's makes it almost impossible to point out fascist tendencies before they become "the new normal".</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Most likely you heard this talking about the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact, it wasn't an alliance, it was a non-agression pact, they wouldn't sign an alliance with the country that swore to destroy them. Why did they sign a non-agression pact even though they were mortal ennemies ? As of 1939, the USSR was not in a position to fight the Axis forces alone, after the Allies had refused to join forced at the USSR's demand to crush the Nazis before they had time to militarize (1935 if i'm not mistaken), the soviets knew they were on their own. They accepted to partion Poland to move the border forward, thus earning more time to : -Fortify strategic position -Deploy troop to defend said locations -Move industry deeper in the land in case the ennemy approches. Looking back on the eastern front, all of this was key for the soviet success. So yes, a pragmatic diplomatic move, but anything but an alliance.</TEXT>

The indicator or economic health in capitalism is production growth rate. Capitalism rely on never ending increase of profuction. Even when it's useless, it created programmed obsolesence wich sole purpose is to waste natural ressources to increase sells. "It doesn't value creativity" Look at Micheal Bay or Adam Sandler, and dare look me in the eyes and say "Capitalism rewards creativity and innovation". "Mass murders" The Khmers Rouges weren't remotely socialist, they were backed by the US to oppose the viet-minh.
