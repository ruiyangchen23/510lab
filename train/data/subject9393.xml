    <TITLE>Is my mom emotionally abusive?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-08-22 02:50:43</DATE>
    <TEXT>I apologize if this isn't the right place to post this, but since there isn't a subreddit simply about abusive parents in general, this seems to be the only place to turn. My mother is definitely insane, but is she abusive? All the things she does is technically because she loves me "too much." She's always been extremely overprotective. Some of the things she's done include: -invading my privacy consistently in my teen years. She stalked my social media (once I was allowed to have it) and read more than one of my journals. This always resulted in me getting in trouble for things no one else would ever get in trouble for. Everything I did was bad in her eyes. -I wasn't allowed to have Internet on my phone for about 2 years (14-16). Doesn't seem like a big deal, but it really closed me off from the outside world. -wouldn't let me listen to certain music, two times she took my iPod and listened to almost every song on it deciding whether it was appropriate or not, and deleted the ones she found inappropriate. (I was 16) -at one point she had about 3 trackers on my phone, which she checked regularly. They were inaccurate and I got in trouble for apparently being places I never went to. -she often hated my friends without valid reason, and wouldn't let me do things with them when she was in one of her moods. She was certain there would be boys and drinking (there never was.) Asking to hang out at a friend's house could turn into a 2 hour debacle. Sometimes I canceled plans myself because I was too scared to even ask my mom. -when this became too much I told her I was going to live at my grandma's (her mom). She threw a fit and threatened legal action against me. (I have some health issues and she said she would take me to court and have me forcibly hospitalized if I didn't stay with her) -told me no one cares about me like she does (seems manipulative to me?) -has told me repeatedly she'd be surprised if I even lived another year, month, or something even a week. Low and behold, I'm still here. -after her first breakdown I started living with my dad in his basement suite (he was working on moving out officially) and I planned to move out with him. When I told my mom this she had a psychotic break, started hauling some of her belongings up the stairs, throwing things related to her marriage down the stairs, screaming/crying, hyperventilating, telling my dad and I we were ruining her life, etc. Said other horrible things to my dad. She seemed to be a danger to herself so my dad called the police. She started freaking out more. -wouldn't let me get a job because "my health" and also that she needs my disability paycheck. (I'm not disabled, but she needs me to pretend to be or we won't have a home because she apparently can't work). -wouldn't let me drive because I'm apparently not in the right mental state. -told me she can tell I'm losing my grip on reality (gaslighting?) -became convinced I had tried to scam 20 dollars off of her. I had borrowed money from her (she offered) and I didn't end up using it. Obviously I planned to give it back to her, but since I didn't transfer it back immediately, it was clear to her I was being dishonest and trying to steal it. What I'd done was apparently so bad that she wouldn't bring it up for 2 days, she just kept me wondering what I did wrong. She just kept alluding to the fact that I "knew what I did." When we had the conversation finally, I told her my side, but she wouldn't listen and had this complex conspiracy on all the things I did wrong. I left and went to my room, where she started pounding on the door and threatening to take away everything I own, and then threatened me further but didn't specify with what. I packed a bag quick and ran out the front door. She called the police and and threatened to have me put in the psych ward. Funny enough it ended with her being in the psych ward, and not me. Other than all that (and that's just a small summary) all she does is lay in bed. She only gets up to go to the bathroom, sometimes get something to eat (though usually I get it for her), or drive somewhere if she absolutely has to. She's talked horribly to me about my dad, uses me as her personal therapist, and after all this gets mad at me for not treating her right.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>TOCD or actually transgender?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-09-06 01:14:42</DATE>
    <TEXT>Okay. So I know OCD definitely plays a role, but I have to wonder if there's more to it. I'm female, as in biologically female. But I experience extreme discomfort when being perceived as such. I have never considered myself to be trans for a number of reasons. One of them being that I love the benefits of being female, being allowed to enjoy whatever I want without society telling me it's not manly enough, or that I'm gay. Socially, women have it easier, and for that reason alone I feel "okay" with being female. Aside from that, I feel legitimately embarrassed by my gender. Being referred to as female makes me feel incredibly uncomfortable. When people ask for my pronouns (I appear mostly androgynous) it stresses me out because I have to respond with she/her, even though I don't identify that way. It's not so much that I identify as male, but that I DON'T identify as female. I have these thoughts so often that it definitely feels like one of my obsessions, as I've experienced HOCD before and it feels similar. So, could I get another opinion? Is this dysphoria, an obsession, or both? And if it's dysphoria, why do I feel so unsure about it? Please respond, I really need to hear someone else's take on this.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>"OCD isn't real"</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-09-21 12:01:43</DATE>
    <TEXT>I have this problem where my opinions can be easily swayed if a person sounds sure enough in their own argument. This only lasts for a short while before I go back to my actual opinions (all of which are typically very strong). However, lately I've been seeing people arguing that OCD doesnt exist. How is this possible? Would they also argue that other illnesses, such as DID or Schizophrenia, don't exist? I personally wouldn't question the existence of either. So why is it that when people say OCD doesnt exist, I wonder if they're right? Is this my OCD making me question not only if I REALLY have OCD, but if OCD even exists in the first place? I now see myself as weak minded for letting this supposed imaginary illness control me. I fucking hate myself for having this and not feeling able to control it. I can't stand this doubt. I feel like I'm making it all up now.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It seems as though every fall/winter, I become allergic to all the skincare products that work perfectly fine any other time of year. My face becomes incredibly dry and every product I try causes major irritation and I HAVE to scratch. Are they simply irritating my skin because the cold weather dries it out? And if so, why is it that certain products will work a few times, until it seems as though my skin has built up an immunity to it? Please help, every colder season is miserable for me as I'm constantly scratching my face. Are there any products you would recommend me trying? Any tips would be appreciated. (Natural products affect me as well, it's not the chemicals or anything like that.)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Unintentional weight loss</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-10-07 07:55:43</DATE>
    <TEXT>I posted this same thing about a month ago, but no one responded. I apologize for the repost, but I'm desperate for answers. Age: 19 Sex: female Height: 5"4 Weight: 80 lbs Medical issues: anemic, non diabetic hypoglycemia, overactive thyroid (?), apparent borderline lupus Medications: Zoloft and Trazadone So when I was 14 I started having trouble eating. Let it be clear that it was NOT an eating disorder of any kind, nor is it now. I simply couldn't bring myself to eat. Even the smell of food made me sick. In this time I dropped from just over 100 pounds, to somewhere in the low 80's. Over time my appetite has gotten slightly better, even to the point that I'm able to eat a normal amount of food every day, like the average person. I still have a hard time now and then, but there's no reason that I shouldn't have gotten back to my previous weight by now. I've been hospitalized for this reason 4 times, trying to find out the cause. However, the doctors never believe me when I say I'm not purposely restricting food, and that I would love to gain weight if I could. In the end they all come to the conclusion that I'm purposely starving myself, which is very upsetting considering that has never been the case. The only problem they came up with in the hospital was an extremely over-active thyroid, which you would think would be the cause. However, they later applied some kind of filter to the blood results (sorry I can't remember the technicalities, this was a few years ago) and that caused them to come back as completely normal. (I have my doubts, but since I'm not a doctor I obviously can't refute this). During my time in the hospital, I've been put on a high calorie diet, feeding tube, etc. All of which worked for a short period of time before I lost all the weight again. There is no humanly possible way to maintain any weight by normal measures. Other potentially related symptoms include somewhat frequent diarrhea (probably at least a few times a month, nothing crazy), and dizzy spells. I'm not sure of anything else. My final question is whether anyone knows if my medications could be related to this weight loss. I lost it all in the same period of time I started taking them, so I thought it was worth considering. I'm taking zoloft and trazadone which I've heard can cause major weight change in some people, though usually it's weight gain. If anyone has any idea whatsoever as to what could be causing this, please tell me. I keep losing weight little by little, and I really don't want to get under 80 pounds.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So I have a bit of a problem. I consider myself an animal lover but I know that's not even a possibility as long as I continue to eat meat and animal products. The issue is that I'm only 80 pounds and I'm a picky eater as it is. There are very few things I feel I'm able to eat in large amounts, and most of them include animal products in some way or another. I hate myself for eating meat and animal products but I'm afraid that if I don't I'll waste away. What should I do?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[TOMT] [BOOK] YA novel about a roadtrip</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-11-29 04:10:24</DATE>
    <TEXT>The cover, IIRC, was beige/cream in color with a design of a map on it. It also had other images, such as a dog and a compass. In summary, it was about a young guy going on a trip with his father, soon to be step mother, best friend, and I think maybe a younger sibling. It also consists of flashbacks involving two different characters named Amanda (one nicknamed "Amanda Sandwich), an online friend nicknamed "Carrots," etc. Along the way he catches his friend getting frisky with his step mother, witnesses a dog being torn apart in traffic, and finally meets the long awaited "Carrots" (who turns out to be a disappointment.) There isn't a lot I remember about it, but for some reason I feel the need to find it again. It's possible that the title consisted of numbers, which may be why I can't remember the name. I can't be sure though.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've been an atheist for about 5 years now, and yet I can't drop the lingering feeling that maybe I do believe in God. My whole life I've been taught that the only reason atheists "don't believe in God" is because they don't want to be held accountable for their sins. I genuinely don't believe in God but my thoughts keep telling me I'm just a bad person and I'm in denial. It's a really lonely feeling because Christians think I chose not to believe and the average atheist just wouldn't understand.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Isitbullshit: naturopath technology bullshit?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-01-02 03:54:04</DATE>
    <TEXT>EDIT: I found the machine: http://moosejawnaturopathicclinic.ca/diagnostic-tools/ I feel dumb for even asking this question, but here goes. My mom is one of those people who believe in holistic healing. The amount of bullshit she still believes in is insane, but thankfully I've realized by now that most of the things she believes in have nothing to back them up. Now to the point. About 5 years ago I started getting really sick. We'd tried many doctors and specialists and they just couldn't come to a conclusive answer. So, my mom decided to take me to a naturopathic doctor. Essentially all he did was hook me up to some "state of the art" equipment (put on this headphone-like device) and it was apparently able to read everything that could possibly be wrong with my body. JUST by putting a pair of glorified headphones on me. According to this device, I had Candida overgrowth and an irregular amount of mercury in my body. There's no way this shit was real, right? And please, if anyone has any idea what this bit of technology might have been called, please please tell me so I can research it myself. My mother swears by it and while 99.9% of me thinks it's a load of crap, I can't actually find the proper evidence to prove her wrong.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Interesting. I won't knock all natural remedies as BS, but I've had a lot of experience with them and unfortunately none of them have worked for me. I'm glad you were able to help yourself with them, though. I had no symptoms of candidiasis besides the ones concerning mood or fatigue, but I believe those are separate issues altogether. He told us that the cause of my severe weight loss (that was my primary problem) was the result of candida overgrowth. He put me on this counterproductive diet where I had to cut out sugar, dairy products, and anything high in carbs. He said that in the long run this would help me to gain weight lol. I also took garlic capsules as this would apparently kill the candida and help me to gain weight. As for the whole mercury thing, funny enough no one paid it any mind. Since no one made a big deal of it, I never bothered to look into it either. Chances are it's non existent anyway.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My situation wasn't quite as bad as yours, but I can definitely relate. My parents debated me (well they tried, I didn't argue), for hours when they found out. To this day, 4 years later, my mother still acts as though I believe in God. As much as it sucks, my advice to you is to go along with whatever your parents want for you. Let them think you finally realized God's existence. You only have a year or so before you can get out. Start looking for other jobs if you can and save up some money. It'll get easier. Also, it's very admirable that you and your girlfriend have been together this long and have never let your separate beliefs become an issue. If only everyone could be as rational and mature about these things as you.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It sounds like you could have NPD, but obviously no one here can diagnose you. Plus, I don't think there's a need to put a label on something you don't need to. About being scared, read what you just said. You said "I am still myself." Despite having these traits, it doesn't sound to me like you're a bad person. If it did turn out that you have NPD, there's no reason anyone but you would have to know. And adding a label to it wouldn't make you any better or worse than you are now. The people you're close with will still see you the way you are, or at least the way you portray yourself. You're not a bad person.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm tend to be attracted to girls at least a little more extroverted than me, aren't stereotypically feminine, and don't take things too seriously.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have a few characters like that of my own, but I mostly project on already existing characters. It really helps for some reason.</TEXT>
