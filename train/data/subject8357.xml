    <TEXT>Hey I used to work at Hershey centre. The hours were limited but you got to make you own schedule. Being in school. I had to work around exams and assignments. But from just working 4 hour shifts on some weekends I was able to rake in about $200-300 a month. Jobs such as usher and guest services depend on the event schedule. However building maintenance can provide steady and consistent hours. I would try with Powerade centre or Hershey centre for a create your own schedule type of job! Hope you have some luck!!</TEXT>
