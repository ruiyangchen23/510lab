    <TEXT>While in the isles of Scotland, we stayed in a B amp;B. It was owned by a couple. The bedrooms were extremely well done and beautiful, but on everything there was signs to not "touch". To use the shower, you would have to ask the couple and the Internet ended at 11pm. The woman would also check on everyone at random times in the night, we would hear creeping in the hallway to make sure "everyone was sleeping" and not doing any illegal things like using the Internet. When we checked out of her B amp;B, she came into our room and said that we "stunk", and opened the window to prove this and demanded for money immediately. Another traveller was kicked out of the B amp;B because the checkout time was 10am, and they were forced to stand outside (she wouldn't even let them stay inside) in the thunderstorm while their taxi came. Another traveller had to go a check (we were in an isolated place) to pay for the room and she took their bags and wouldn't give them back. But on the way out...she asked everyone if they enjoyed their stay! EDIT: so I took a look at their trip advisor page and the ownership seems to have changed to a much nicer couple since we visited it in 2015. However all of the negative reviews are from before the change. Location was Isle of Skye, Portree</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The stereotypical "I went to Africa and helped kids". Since I go to a private school, lots of people talk about going to Africa just for the college cred. But let's face it, while it's a good cause, there are so many people doing the same thing and colleges can't distinguish if your only achievement/essay is going on a service trip. And if it's not funded through a scholarship or such, just hints at how much money your parents have (which makes college admissions expect more of you).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>From taking a look at your previous posts, it seems that nothing will change your mind...  gt;I'm more talking about how leftists, atheists are generally people who sheepishly believe everything science, media, and government authorities tell them. When one questions events on the news, scientific ''facts'', and geo-political events the people who bash conspiracy minded people are usually atheist humanist types. They will call you a wacko, tinfoiler, and other buzzword names for not believing that a man in a cave in Afghanistan pulled off the biggest most complex terror attack of all time. I have literally had these types of people say ''they have no reason to lie to us''.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well not my story, but my parents did have an arranged marriage (India). These days, it's much much more common for the to be bride and groom to meet several times before their marriage. My mom and dad had almost an year before the marriage to make sure they were good for each other. My dad worked in Singapore, and my mom would call him daily and talk for hours. Their parents also worked in the same policing district and they knew each other before the original fixing. Other couples I know have had a similar situation. Now as for the sex, I'm not really sure. I was born two years after their marriage...so that's something? My mom would not even tell me how I was conceived, she tells me that she wished for me and boom I was planted in her stomach. You'll notice that more conservative cultures, sex is not openly discussed. These are also the cultures where most marriages are arranged. In India, sex is a HUGE taboo, and I will guess that the first sexual experiences were very awkward. There is no thing such as sex ed in India, and parents do not ever bring up the topic. I know mine haven't.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It is interesting. If someone mentioned the idea of sex to my grandparents, they'd probably have a heart attack despite how common it is and the fact that they would have had to have it. The fact that sex is taboo also leads to many men looking for love online quite inappropriately since they are so curious.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was acquainted with someone who always asked me about what "drama" was going on and always wanted to gossip about happenings. I never really responded to her as I don't enjoy that type of talk especially with near strangers. A few months later I find out that she sends lewd messages to minors on Facebook. She lives in a different country than most of the people she messaged so it's hard for her to be reported. She would often send messages to people about her sex life and asked if people were virgins. She also advanced on someone telling that she'd be willing to do it with someone to prove that the person she messaged was bi. Glad I never responded to her.</TEXT>

People said bank robber, carjacking, etc. But I said maybe it's a school shooting. People said no, that can't happen here, this is an extremely safe town. 15 minutes later, we get to know that there was indeed a school shooting at Noblesville West. That was creepy.</TEXT>

While it's not entirely a scam, it's a way for these for profit organizations to pocket parent's hard earned money to watch a surgery over Skype and sit in a lecture hall of 1000 people.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My dad and I switched phone numbers a while ago, but I still get a few of his texts. A month ago, I got a text from a guy who rarely works or contributes (according to my dad) saying that he had fallen in the shower and hurt his arm and back. Now, I have always taught falling in the shower was a myth, so I didn't think too much of it and forwarded it to dad. Turns out, he'd broken his arm and collarbone. A pretty embarrassing way to break the two...</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I went to a Montessori school for a few months as a child. There was a "room" in this school where misbehaving children would be put, and whenever they came out they would be crying. However, they were not allowed to talk about it or they'd be put in the room again. I believe that room was where teachers would hit the kids as a lot of my friends were traumatised. As for me, I remember having my shoelaces untied once and one of the teachers berated me by calling me useless (I was 3). I would cry every single day I went to that "school". I've looked the school up, but I can no longer find it, so I'm hoping it's a sign it's been permanently closed.</TEXT>

He also wore heavy belt buckles and joked about using them as a weapon. When there was a school shooting recently, he was like "oh cool!". Didn't talk to him after that. EDIT: So a lot of people are replying to me why I didn't report him. The school already knows about his issues and he's been referred for anger issues to the counselor for lashing out at a teacher. He doesn't believe he is a threat though - I believe that he had some mental issues since he didn't understand how creepy his behavior truly was</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Our plane was having a *huge* delay in getting on the runway, we had been sitting motionless for over 2 hours. At this point, everyone on the plane is super agitated and cannot wait for the plane to start, when on the final inspection, the plane has technical difficulties that cause it to be delayed yet another hour. So most people turn on electronics, including myself, when a middle aged man SHRIEKS that electronics are dangerous and literally rages that everyone turn off their phones. He continues that we are setting a bad example for his children. But when his family calls in to ask why the plane hasn't departed yet, he obviously answers his phone. The plane was not even moving, nor was it even close to get on the runway.</TEXT>

During school, the tornado drills are done at least yearly, and I've been caught up in one tornado while at school. That was an annoyance due to the fact we were held in school after dismissal due to the tornado raging about. Houses here have basements too, so it's not something people worry about.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've been to eight schools since kindergarten. In fourth grade, I remembering becoming friends with a girl who I'll call D. D was seemingly from a mysterious family, she moved to the school for fourth grade and had a sister who did not look anything alike and a father...well no one exactly knew what he did. People said D's mother was in jail, D's father was actually kidnaping D and her sister, or that D and her family were spies sent from another country. Now, it was probably people's overactive imaginations, but I want to know, what was it *really*? Never got to find out since I moved the next year.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Some job postings in the tech sector are fishy, and created specifically for *H1B candidates* to get their PERM filed so they can start the green card/permanent residency process. The PERM shows that that the H1b holder is the only one with the specialized skills to do this job. These fake ads seem real at the surface, but really they don't need anyone. Frustrating thing is that they look legitimate.</TEXT>

While on the train, there was a man who had his head out, probably looking to get off the next exit. There are many poles next to the railroad, and these poles are very close to the actual train. The train was moving very fast, and the man who had his head out....didn't survive.</TEXT>

One fly told me that he was escaping from a house where he had constantly been swatted at. He was looking to start a new life and hopefully get married and have kids, as many as possible. He had a dislike of owners of houses, and wanted to spite them by having his children invade them.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ay, this might be controversial but I'll go on. If you mean the original Uggy, she died (of pneumonia) I believe in December 2015. Her friend Horseygal3326 (the #1 player who's changed her name to LoveUggyToInfinity!) apparently hacked her and stole most of her RCs. LoveUggy got docked down to 2 karma I believe and was banned for a while. There was a huge argument in the event forums too which led to a few people getting perma banned from the forums. I don't know tooo much, but that's the gist of it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Alexander Graham Bell. "Invented" the telephone, but wanted to stop the "contamination" of deaf people in society. He attempted to stop intermarriage between deaf and hearing people, and advocated for the ban of sign language. He also was a fan of eugenics to eliminate deaf people. EDIT: Informed that Meucci actually invented the telephone but Bell had the money to patent and so took the credit.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2018-07-03 17:24:29</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hello, We are writing you today to bring you some information about a change in the account sharing feature that will go online in a couple pf weeks. First, as a default for after the maintenance period, the co-management feature will be active for everyone who has shared their account via the feature until the account owner logs in. You will still keep the same number of co-managers and how to add them won #8217;t change either. So, what #8217;s going to be different? It will no longer be possible to have more than one person logged into the account at any given time. To allow your co-managers to access your account while you #8217;re offline, you must activate the feature each time you #8217;re in-game before you log out. The activation will last for 30-days as long as the owner doesn #8217;t access the account. If a co-manager is logged into the shared account, and the owner wants to access it, the owner will get priority. This means the co-manager will be booted to make room for the owner. Warmest Regards, The Howrse Team</TEXT>

    <TEXT>More emphasis on real world skills. Too much of what we learn in school isn't directly applicable to the outside world. There needs to be more focus on the things people must do to live in society - managing credit cards, taxes, voting, civic responsibility, distinguishing whether something is trustable, etc. The student loan crisis is a huge example of how the education system has failed us.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I want to add reading great books to this list. A lot of schools in high poverty areas don't stress reading and there's many students who aren't able to read at 5th grade level even as a graduating senior. Reading expands vocabulary, teaching how to construct sentences well, and builds on your memory. The skills you gain are transferable to the adult world and these skills are essential for thriving as an adult.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Top players aren #8217;t just disappearing from UK server - they #8217;re disappearing from all servers. I used to actively play on Int. and was ranked in top 10. But due to the threat of the spring cleaning, apathetic mods and admin, and now the co management change, I #8217;ve distanced myself from the game. The team atmosphere is also very toxic with certain people flouting the rules by using bots to script blup and the like. The few times I go on is to  #8220;riot #8221; and  #8220;create discord #8221; in the forum - which is just really disagreeing with the changes. Yesterday there was a large events forum riot due to the co management changes. They docked/warned several people for complaining about the admin/mods. You #8217;ll see a lot of once addicted players leaving. The best way to signal disapproval is with your wallet - since they are so money hungry. They tell us  #8220;we will look into it #8221; when we give them our opinions on new and upcoming changes, but change nothing. The co management change was announced a month or so ago, and the admin had heard SO many players #8217; opinions. They did not take one suggestion into account. Is the test forum just a formality now? The mods have become brainwashed pawns of the admin too. Hell, most mods are not even competitive players so they do not understand how important co management is. Another issue is that players are no longer allowed to have fun anymore. Simple joking on the VIP forum will get you a reprimand by a moderator. A moderator told a player,  #8220;May I suggest that if you have run out of sensible things to say you could go and do something useful. #8221; This comment was extremely rude and the moderator has not of yet apologized. Of course the admin took her side and will not be taking action against her. The vibe in the community is so negative. People are afraid of joking with someone and god help you if you say anything bad about the admin. And last of all, of course the spring cleaning. You're screwed if you get caught trafficking - 8 karma dock immediately. They have even docked some players for selling horses for 500e in bulk to their friends! They say it is to reduce scams, but it is really to line their own pockets. By forcing players to buy their overpriced passes from the game, Cowlient thinks they are doing a genius move. Owlient is also going to be taking away the pass horses. They are making this entire game pay to play. What's a player to do? Leave, or at least stop supporting the game with their $$$. It's no wonder why the UK server players left. You can be certain more from all servers will be joining them.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In first grade, we had daily journal entries. One day, I wrote an entry about a pair of pants I had. I was really proud of it. I drew a nice picture of pants to go along with it, and colored it with a plush pink color crayon. It looked beautiful and was a nice break from my daily stories of going to the supermarket or playing with my beads. Well...a few days later I find that the teacher is reading out our journal entries. She gets to one that sounds familiar. I listen in. It's my entry. She reads out the description - soft and fleece. It's quite a change from the other entries about going to the pool or grandma's house. The class is silent. She comments that it was terrible, and promptly goes onto the next journal. I'm still proud of it.</TEXT>

"He makes things up. And he's making that up, as he has other things." I think he completely hits the point. Trump just isn't fit to be a politician, much less the president.
