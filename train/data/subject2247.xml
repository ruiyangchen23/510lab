    <TITLE>Are there any areas of British history that you think are underappreciated or not taught enough etc.?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-05-18 12:43:45</DATE>
    <TEXT>I ask because I was watching The Last Kingdom which is about the Kingdoms of Wessex and Northumbria (before "England" was a thing) and their fight against Danish rule in around 700 - 900 A.D. and I realised that I know nothing about it at all. I had heard of King Alfred the Great in name, heard of Viking invasions but no detail. I think most people know about the ancient Britons, Roman rule and then there's about 1,000 years of pretty empty space (like, what was going on in 500 AD? No idea.) before you're taught about King Harold and Willy the Conqueror, leading into the medieval ages with the Tudors, the Elizabethans and so on. What's an area of British history that you are interested in or you feel is unknown to most British people.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>What does Jim do for a living? I don't think he has a job, I think his back story is a lot shadier than he lets on (although unknown to him too). We know he has a brother, and we know that Jim looked after his cat while he was "well, not in prison...". We also know that Jim does not understand when people are giving him things to look after, rather than to keep (Buggy). I have a theory that Jim's brother is some kind of bank robber / money launder and regularly turns up at Jim's house with money to hide, that Jim just assumes is for himself and splashes it on luxuries, like an elm bath. He also learned Chinese in Japan... Some sort of Yakuza/Triad thing going on there? Am I in too deep?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For example, if you are doing business with the Japanese, silence is considered golden and adds to your credibility. They have a proverb, "the duck who quacks is the first to be shot". If a meeting is particularly stressful or detailed, they will often sit in perfect silence in order to relieve the tension, maybe even for a few minutes. In the UK, silence in meetings tends to *add* to the tension. If you try and fill the silence, they may consider you to be foolish or lacking credibility and therefore unlikely to reach an agreement.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Reminded of the chap who proudly showed us his crab paste sandwiches with a side of wine gums and beef flavoured monster munch. M'lady loves a shit meal... Fish fingers and pasta is a favourite of hers but she's recently started the following: - One tortilla wrap - Two Dairylea triangles, spread over the wrap. - One potato waffle placed on said wrap. - Two turkey dinosaurs on top of the waffle. - Roll it up and eat. Personally, I think that sounds like utter shite but she works longer and harder than me so I understand not wanting to cook a proper meal. Do you have any shit meals that you love to make?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Question to the room: World Cup ideas.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-06-08 12:49:45</DATE>
    <TEXT>Now I know that football isn't massively popular on this subreddit but it is still undeniably the biggest sporting event in the world and England will be the sole member of the United Kingdom representing in Russia 2018. We've been mulling over in the mod chat about what to do for the World Cup and I think it's best if we hear your thoughts on the matter. /r/Soccer gets a huge amount of attention during the World Cup and as they're just shy of a million users, it's often hard to keep up with the discussion as the match threads will get thousands of comments, which is why we'd quite like to do something for it too. **ideas so far** - We will probably have a daily sticky thread to chat about the events of the World Cup that particular day, starting from the opening ceremony next Thursday. This will not impact the regular stickies like Monday Morning, WASDnesday etc. - We're thinking of hosting match threads for the England Games and we'll sticky them. I am going to be in Volgograd for the first one so if anyone here is up for running a match thread for England v Tunisia, that'd be fantastic. What do you reckon, is that a decent level of coverage? We'll try and contain all World Cup chat into the daily sticky and the England match threads so those of you who cannot stand football can easily avoid it. Any other ideas and suggestions are welcome. Cheers!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I see it happening quite a lot these days, especially on the tube. When I was a chiddler my parents always told me to give up a seat for a grown up as they've probably had a longer day at work whereas I was looking at bugs in the garden. Not overly keen on the new arrangement, kids have bags of energy and usually end up not sitting in the seat when it's given to them, but instead clambering all over it. Have you witnessed this growing trend? If so, what are your thoughts?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hello! When I play Skyrim, all I want to do is sneaky sneaky archer my way around a cave/castle or whatever, kill all the baddies and then loot all their stuff, before returning to my Riverwood starter home to store it in my chest. It's a bit ridiculous, in an old save I had around 1,000 jewels, unique armours/weapons and various items just collecting dust in my chest. I am a Skyrim hoarder! **Mods I have so far** - Immersive creatures as I enjoy a varied baddie (although some of them look dumb as shit). - Immersive armours / weapons (although there doesn't seem to be too many of them?) - Immersive loot (seems to add a few things like jeweled cups/horns) - Rich merchants as sometimes you just have to sell your shit - A mod that makes jewelry look a bit nicer / more unique. - Sounds of wild life / civilisation (which are great!) Is there anything else you would recommend to make my archering/looting/hoarding even more fun? My main problem is that I still feel that there is not enough "stuff" in terms of weapons/armour/items/baddies and I'm not sure if that's because the 'immersive' packs do not have *that* many new options, or I am just overzealous and will never been content.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2018-06-14 02:18:14</DATE>
    <TEXT>**Welcome to /r/CasualUK's first ever World Cup thread!** In line with our post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/comments/8piwgt/question_to_the_room_world_cup_ideas/), we will be posting a daily World Cup thread where everyone can pile in and talk about the matches being played that day. Let's crack on with day one! __________________________________________________ **Fantasy World Cup** If you haven't already joined, /u/aCNDerivative has put together a Fantasy league for the World Cup. [Details in here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/comments/8qrlap/casualuk_world_cup_fantasy_football_league/) __________________________________________________ **World Cup 2018** Host: Russia 2014 Champions: Germany 2018 Bookies favourite: Brazil __________________________________________________ **Opening Ceremony** The 2018 opening ceremony will be kicking off at 15:30 UK time and will feature a bit of Robbie Williams, which I am thrilled about. ITV have the broadcasting rights to the first game so you can watch all of it unfold there. __________________________________________________ **First Game - Russia vs Saudi Arabia** Russia and Saudi Arabia are in Group A, along with Egypt and Uruguay. Not a group that has captured the hearts and minds of football lovers but there could certainly be some interesting results and it's pretty hard to guess who is going to join Uruguay in the next round. **Kick-Off**: 16:00 UK time. **Venue**: [Luzhniki Stadium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luzhniki_Stadium) **Channel**: ITV1 (or ITV Iplayer) **Need to know stats as follows:** | Russia | Saudi Arabia | ---|---|--- **Manager** | [Stanislav Cherchesov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanislav_Cherchesov) | [Juan Antonio Pizzi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Antonio_Pizzi) **Captain** | [Igor Akinfeev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igor_Akinfeev) | [Omar Hawsawi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osama_Hawsawi) **Top current goalscorer** | [Fyodor Smolov (12)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fyodor_Smolov) | [Mohammad Al-Sahlawi (28)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammad_Al-Sahlawi) **Current FIFA ranking** | 70 | 67 **How they qualified** | Host country | Second in Asian Group B (round three) behind Japan **Odds of winning the World Cup** | 40 - 1 | 1,000 - 1 __________________________________________________________________________________ **Gentle Reminder** Throughout the World Cup, please remember the rules of CasualUK as all of these rules will be in place as usual. Let's keep politics out of it, let's treat everyone who we want to be treated and let's have a good time. To the seasoned football fans, let's make it a positive environment for any newbies watching their first tournament or for any non-Brits who fancy coming over to join us. To newbies, IT Crowd memes will be met with swift vengeance. **It's time for the World Cup!!!**</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was in Russia for the World Cup for just over a week and had a fantastic time. All of the Russian people I met were so friendly, so welcoming. Your cities were so clean, the metros are so much nicer than back here in London. (The driving was a little scary but you get used to it). I hope you are all enjoying the World Cup so far and the large numbers of foreign fans have not disturbed you too much!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Credit Card fraud - a few questions.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-06-25 18:18:29</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hello! My credit card expired in June and so I requested a new one to be sent to my new address. I have learned that Barclaycard then sent this new card to my old address in a different city. Brilliant. Unfortunately whoever got their hands on it then went and spent about  #163;800 on contactless payments all over the city. They managed to get away with it for about 7 days because I was out of the country and wasn't checking my online statements. When I realised what was going on back in the UK, I called Barclaycard to urgently cancel the card because the person was still going mad with it. Barclaycard admitted that they had fucked up and refunded me within a few days which was good of them. Questions are as follows: - As the card was sent to my old address, will they be able to just tell the police to go and knock on the door and have a word with whoever was going mad with my card? Should I email my old landlady and say "not sure who you're renting the place out to but they are a prize helmet". My understanding is that I am not privy to the investigation when I really want to be! - As I was in Russia when I called Barclaycard, I have clocked up a phone bill of  #163;113 which is far from ideal. Is it worth sending Barclaycard the invoice and asking them to pay it / reimburse me, or should I just chalk it off as a loss? - Will this fraudulent activity have any effect on my credit score or will it be fine as the money was refunded by Barclaycard within a matter of days? Any guidance you could provide would be fantastic. Thank you!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Realistic goals for the 18/19 campaign.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-06-26 11:14:06</DATE>
    <TEXT>Our fourth campaign in the top flight and we are yet to beat our points tally from the first season under Quiche. Just wanted to gauge your thoughts on how you reasonably expect the team to perform this season, as well as your own personal ambitions for the season. Personally I think this will be the toughest season we have faced yet. Wolves and Fulham are coming up with cash to spend and points to prove. West Ham have onboarded a top class manager, Everton have hired the snake, Southampton will not want another season languishing down the bottom. All three promoted clubs last season will want to consolidate their position in the Premier League although 'second season syndrome' has hit clubs before, like Hull and Wigan. I want us to make a real push for a top ten finish and I think our midfield, wingers and full-back positions are in the top ten. Realistically, without a Premier League quality goal scorer, a top centre-back and a shiny new keeper, I can see us leaking more than we score, as things stand. For me, I think we'll finish around 15th on 40 - 45 points. Standard season of beating a few of the big boys and languishing in defeat away at Cardiff. What do you think, feeling more optimistic under Gracia and the current squad than I am? I want to get carried away and say "we'll finish 8th!!!" but based on prior seasons I'm not going to get ahead of myself. **Other predictions** **Winners**: Manchester City **Top Four**: Manchester City, Manchester United, Chelsea, Tottenham Hotspur. **Relegated**: Huddersfield, Brighton, Cardiff.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2018-06-26 15:46:46</DATE>
    <TEXT>I don't know if you have a favourite office toilet cubicle but I do, and I am growing a little tired of finding it obliterated whenever I fancy a little sit down. Everyone you speak to hates finding the toilets in a state but there must be at least one person in each office who enjoys ruining it for everyone else, otherwise this wouldn't be a problem. So the question is, why do you do it? Is your diet so horrible that a solid log is out of the question? Are you scared of toilet seat germs and hover, spraying liquid shit all over the cubicle? Is it a power thing - maybe the boss called you out on something and you decided "I know, I'll shart all over the toilets, that'll team him". Help me to help you.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>The Hammersmith Ghost and its effect on UK law.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-06-27 12:00:41</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hello. I did a degree in law but now I don't work in law but I have many interesting cases to share so I'm going to force you to read about some of my favourite cases that you may or may not be aware of and I hope you enjoy them because It's becoming a weekly section. __________________________________________________ **The Hammersmith Ghost** The year is 1803 and trouble was afoot. If there is one thing that the Georgians enjoyed more than Evangelicalism and warring with the French, it was ghouls and apparitions. One such ghostly ghoul haunted Hammersmith, supposedly a man who had committed suicide the year prior and was buried in a church graveyard, a big no-no. Supposedly two women on two separate occasions had been grabbed by the fiend causing them to die of shock. Other witnesses came forward to claim that they too had been grabbed by the ghost which caused much stirring. As London did not have a proper organised police force at the time, local residents formed groups of armed patrols (or 'Ghostbusters', if you will). __________________________________________________ **Francis Smith and the Hammersmith Ghost** Francis Smith was a 29 year old taxman turned ghostbuster. He wandered the streets on his usual patrol late one night, probably whistling a jaunty tune and doffing his cap to a busty wench, I don't know. He did not expect to run into the Hammersmith ghost that night, but he did. Across the street he saw the apparition sauntering along, dressed completely in white from head to toe. Francis did what any of us would have done. He approached the ghost, and shot him in the face. __________________________________________________ **What happened next?!** You're on absolute tenterhooks here aren't you, all credit to the writer for the suspense. Don't worry, I'll tell you. Turns out the ghost that our brave hero had shot in the face was actually just a regular man called Thomas Millwood. Thomas was a labourer, wearing his usual labourer clothes and heading home to meet his parents. __________________________________________________ **The Trial of Francis Smith** Francis was tried for wilful murder. The deceased's wife, Mrs. Fulbrooke, stated that she had warned the deceased to cover his white clothing with a greatcoat, as he had already been mistaken for the ghost on a previous occasion (don't you hate it when that happens).  gt;On Saturday evening, he and I were at home, for he lived with me; he said he had frightened two ladies and a gentleman who were coming along the terrace in a carriage, for that the man said, he dared to say there goes the ghost; that he said he was no more a ghost than he was, and asked him, using a bad word, did he want a punch of the head; I begged of him to change his dress; Thomas, says I, as there is a piece of work about the ghost, and your clothes look white, pray do put on your great coat, that you may not run any danger - Mrs. Fulbrooke's testimony at the Old Bailey. After a lengthy trial it was decided that Smith did not act in self-defence, nor was it reasonable to shoot a ghost in the face without trying to apprehend it initially. The Judge reminded the jury that the defendants good character meant nothing in this case, for he shot a man in the face. He encouraged the Jury to find the defendant guilty of the murder of Thomas Millwood. The jury, comprised mainly of idiots, returned a verdict of manslaughter which enraged the Judge. "He is either guilty of murder, or he is to be acquitted" he boomed, boomingly. "That Smith believed Millwood to be a ghost was irrelevant, as he was not a ghost". The Jury found him guilty of murder and thus Smith was to hang. However, due to much public outcry the sentence was commuted to one year hard labour. The huge publicity given to the case had meanwhile persuaded the true culprit to come forward #8212;John Graham, an elderly shoemaker. He had been pretending to be a ghost by using a white sheet to frighten his apprentice, who had been scaring the Graham children with ghost stories. __________________________________________________ **Effect on UK Law** Interestingly, this case left a gap in the UK law from 1803 all the way through to 1984. Is it reasonable to do a thing under mistaken identity? R v Williams (Gladstone) settled the case when Gladstone witnessed a man dragging a young man through the streets, while the latter screamed for help. Believing an assault was taking place, Gladstone tackled the assailant, injuring him in the process. It transpired that the young man was actually a burglar who was being placed under a citizens arrest. Gladstone was found guilty of ABH but requested an appeal. The Judge said this:  gt;In a case of self-defence, where self-defence or the prevention of crime is concerned, if the jury came to the conclusion that the defendant believed, or may have believed, that he was being attacked or that a crime was being committed, and that force was necessary to protect himself or to prevent the crime, then the prosecution have not proved their case. If however the defendant's alleged belief was mistaken and if the mistake was an unreasonable one, that may be a peaceful reason for coming to the conclusion that the belief was not honestly held and should be rejected. Even if the jury come to the conclusion that the mistake was an unreasonable one, if the defendant may genuinely have been labouring under it, he is entitled to rely upon it. In layman's terms, the defendant had every right to believe that the young man was suffering at the hands of an abuser and thus intervening was the right thing to do. The conviction was overturned.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My mum loves ancestry and got right into doing the family tree a few years back. Whenever I move she'll always say "oh my great-great-great-great Grandfather owned a butchers near there" or words to that effect. The only interesting ones are the recent ones. Old man was an MP, his old man ran the Inland Revenue, smart pair of lads. A *lot* of military personnel fighting in WWII, WWI, the Boar War, all the way back. A lot of family who emigrated to the new world, Canada, New Zealand etc. Some did it as young as 16, completely on their own! Just boarded a ship and sailed off into the sun set, mental. My mum doesn't touch the family ancestry anymore. She found an ancestor in the 1700s who was hanged for committing a highway robbery. "Our family doesn't do that sort of thing" she muttered, slamming her ancestry book shut and never touching it again. Mum mate, that was 300 years ago. It's not a reflection on you as a person. Any of you chaps know much about the family tree, any stories to tell?</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; I would have thought they were on the teachers side? Definitely was the case in my parents generation and to some extent mine too. If I fucked up some coursework or something my parents would tell me that it's because I was a lazy bellend, which I absolutely was. These days it seems that the parents blame Spencer's poor form on the teachers ineptitude rather than their own terrible parenting and their child's poor attitude. My good friend's missus is a teacher in Hastings, which is not a nice part of the world and she's astounded by how many children can barely read and write, well into upper primary, years 5 and 6. Apparently the parents, for a most part, do not give a shit about that, they even find it funny. Awful state of affairs.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Truth be told, he hasn't played for us since 2014-15 back when we were in the Championship. He hasn't played any football at all since the end of the end of the 2017 season, when he did his cruciate ligament in and spent the whole of last season injured. Honestly not sure what you can expect, been 3/4 years since I've seen him play. I think it's safe to say that he'll never make it at Watford or in the Premier League. Hopefully he can find some sort of form in Scotland and rejuvenate his career a bit.</TEXT>

Now, I was in a flat share two years ago and all bills were paid for by the landlord, I just paid rent. So who are these chumps, what do they want and how do they know where I live? I feel like calling them to profess my innocence will just prove to them that I do live at the address that they sent this letter, and will just open up a big can of worms where I have to somehow find my old landlady (who lives in Malaysia) and sort it all out.

These people have literally never travelled outside of the UK if they think Europe is the utopia that they think it is, where racism and crime does not exist! Right now I am sitting in my team of twelve, two of us are British and the rest hail from France, the Czech Republic, Poland, Germany, the United States and Hungary. All of them love it here, all of them have met lovely British partners and made their lives here, none of them want to go back to their home countries and none of them have ever told me that they've been racially abused anywhere in this country.

This is a challenge to them. "Don't want me sitting next to you?" they think, "Well I am plonking my bum down beside you" like you are Little Miss Muffet and they're an awful arachnid. Instead, when you see them, start patting the seat next to you. Give them a wink, a raised eyebrow or two. Start guffawing to yourself, a proper "hurrr hurrr" laugh as you're just patting this seat, going mad for it. Maybe drool a bit to show how serious you are, you need this person to join you.

    <TEXT>Have you ever seen Lord of War? The intro is fantastic, one of the best introductions to any film I reckon. It shows "the life of a bullet", being created in a factory and then crated and sold, then it skips and it's on a ship heading to an unknown location, then it's in the hands of a child soldier in Africa, before being loaded into an AK47 and fired into someones head. [Here it is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHn1zogeyO4). Wonder whether doing the same for hard drugs would have any impact. Showing some impoverished Colombian stirring his petrol / battery acid concoction, before being swallowed and regurgitated in a small plastic bag as it gets smuggled into Europe. Probably not, but it would be interesting to see.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Growing up in Eastbourne, ours was a homeless lad called Big Dave (he was actually called Alan... No idea where the nickname came from). Spitting image of Father Christmas, big white beard, big red face, big old gut. Come rain or shine, he was always sitting outside the train station, big bag of cans and a glint in his eye. Once thought he was going to die of laughter when some kid face planted off his skateboard in front of him. It used to be a bit of a tradition after pre-drinks when you're heading into town to have a sit down and a can with Big Dave, talk about his life and all that. Lovely man. He died a few years ago, heart attack while he slept. The town was gutted and his obituary was front of the Eastbourne Herald. Who is/was your local celebrity?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm generally pretty happy with Deeney, Gray and Pe #241;aranda as strikers. The beauty of having a midfielder like Will Hughes is he can completely unlock a defence and then put the ball on a plate for the strikers. I don't think our strikers are good at making their own chances but as long as Pererya/Sema, Hughes and Dellyfaeo can set them up, I'm confident that the strikers can put enough away. I'm play a midfield five with Chalobah as a defensive midfielder, Doucoure more box-to-box, Pererya and Deaolifo on the wings and Hughes behind the striker, setting them up for Deeney to finish, or Gray when we're playing teams with a higher line. Basically, I wouldn't say no to another striker but I won't be too concerned if we don't. Defence on the other hand... Happy with a bit of depth at full-back but we need a proper centre-back to join Kabasele.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Is she sending *him* the money? If yes, then it's a massive con. She is perfectly able to complete his immigration documents and all that by herself. To be fair, it is pricey to import a non-European spouse into the UK. You have to sort their visa, their flights, you have to prove that you either earn X amount of money per year (think it's about  #163;35k) *or* have enough savings to prove that they aren't coming here to leech off the state. It could be she earns  #163;25k a year and needs to have  #163;10k in her bank account, in which case this does make sense. My good friend has a Vietnamese m'lady (who is so far out of his league it's unbelievable). She's coming over for two weeks in August. He started the process back in January, had to get her a visa, had to write a letter with references to send to the Immigration authorities to basically prove she was going home after two weeks. He had to book her flights in and out, prove he had  #163;3,000 in savings and provide an itinerary of day to day things they have planned. Basically cost him about  #163;5,000 all in for a *two week holiday*. So basically  #163;17,000 is a stupid amount of money. If she hasn't sent it abroad to him, it might be legit. If she's sent it to him, it's a con.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>PSA: The no politics rule and general casualness!</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-07-30 12:08:23</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hello! We have many new faces on the sub which is brilliant but thought it wise to have a quick refresher on the rules of the sub. - Please, no politics. This means no politicians, no policies, no moaning about the Government, no comparing the purchasing of crumpets to leaving the EU (honestly, some of you are obsessed). We have set up AutoMod to automatically remove any references to various politicians, policies and all that jazz. The list grows longer and AutoMod will publicly scold you. Repeat offenders or those who knowingly break this rule may get a temp ban. - This is a casual sub for casual people, we'll have no trouble here. The topics are supposed to be light-hearted, interesting, helpful and fun. If you're looking at a photo of Blackpool beach and arguing with another user about poverty rates in seaside towns, maybe it's time to go and grab another cup of coffee. - Let's not look down on people. I've seen a spike in users calling people 'chavs', whether that's a man in a tracksuit, a contestant on Love Island or people with tattoos, can we just not? Let's be as lovely as we can. After all, this is a subreddit that has founded relationships, friendships, donated thousands of pounds to charity and strongly advocated mental health awareness. So much we can be proud of here in this community! - Be friendly to our visitors! So often I've seen an American pop in and ask a perfectly reasonable question about British culture, to be met with "fuck off Yank! This sub isn't for you!". None of that! - Please do report stuff that breaks the rules! We average a new comment every 5 seconds and we can't keep up with everything. __________________________________________________ **Submissions** - We love questions but some of them are a little *too* specific/dry and the mod team will request that the OP moves their question over to /r/AskUK. Questions that are interesting, unique or fun will stay! - We're not too keen on moans about energy suppliers, mobile networks and the like. We do appreciate that you don't like Three Mobile or Yodel but we've seen it a million times before. We'll ask to move this to /r/BritishProblems (and tbh, they're actual problems rather than "I tripped and now I have to leave the country"). - We want to encourage more written OC. Whether that's a unique story, an experience, a fun question or whatever else, you'll find that we sticky your OC for the day if it looks good! __________________________________________________ **Your sub** Goes without saying that this is your sub and we're just here to keep it tidy and try and provide content that you all enjoy. If there's anything you think you want to see that's within the rules, or anything you want to see *less* of, please do let us know. For example, we've introduced the TVesday Thread but maybe there's another weekly thread you want to see?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My apartment block has communal bins. I think there's 70 flats here and we have about 10 massive bins and a few recycling ones too, just chuck it all in and the trashmen come and take it all away. From my time in Russia, I didn't see a single house. Just tower blocks. Assuming it works the same way there.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah that was a fun week, that's all okay. The big problem with those kind of posts is that the original one gets 100,000,000 upvotes and so everyone and their mum thinks "I'm going to do the same thing, but worse" and we end up with 50 odd posts about the same thing (see ducks).

Love the girl but she spends an entire film looking at her instagram, rolling around and sleeping. Then at the end she'll proclaim "it was alright but I didn't really get it?". After that I kicked her out and watched Final Space, it's a cartoon about final space. Sort of Futurama meets Rick and Morty but doesn't rely on disgusting noises. Really really good, thoroughly recommend. Plot is fantastic and it's got an insane voice cast.</TEXT>

I watched it so that I could have something to chat about at work that as there's nine women for every one bloke in this office and football doesn't really get talked about. I'm *hoping* that the producers see that this series was a little dry and fully revamp it up for next year. Also I think the first episode is the best, where they're picking their partner as you can tell who finds who attractive right off the bat and where the drama is going to come from.

    <TEXT>It is indeed a Ferrert Armoured Car. Hasn't been used by the British since 1971 but it's still in active service with a lot of our former colonies in Africa, as well as the Middle East. As the wheels are made from rubber, you just have to disarm the gun and you're good to drive on public roads. You can get one of these for around [ #163;6,000 which isn't too shabby](https://tanks-alot.co.uk/product/ferret-armoured-car/).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm at work but it's a slow day today. Only had 12 emails waiting for me and only 2 were things I needed to action. Had a couple of quick calls, made a couple of coffees and just dossing around until 1pm when I'll head to the gym for an hour / hour and a half. The afternoon gets a bit livelier as the US wakes up (work for a US company) so I should have more to do then. Tonight is the work pub quiz, then I'll go home and probably play some more of my Football Manager file where I randomly decided to be Molde FK in the Norwegian league.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Still playing FM17. Scout pops up and tells me to take a look at this 17 year old Bulgarian left-back currently at Espanyol, Matteo Stamatov. Never heard of him but he's got a 4 star potential and costs about  #163;80k. Nice. Google him as he's 19 now (IRL) and I wanted to see how he's progressed IRL. Doesn't have a wikipedia page. First link is his Facebook page. Go on his Facebook, see he's friends with loads of other 18 - 20 year old football players from Bulgaria / Hungary / Spain etc. Spend the next two hours looking these people up on FM and scouting them to see if they're any good. Basically a *real* scout now. Also a stalker.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;You are arguing that politicians referenced in non-political matters are still political. Doug is simply pointing out the Queen falls into the same area. We disagree with Doug. This is a conversation we have had many times and the entire mod team is in agreement that we do not consider the Queen to be a political figure. We've closed the book on that one long ago and it will not be changed.  gt; acting as if people pointing it out are fanatical republicans who should sod off to /r/unitedkingdom is distinctly uncasual. I know Doug well from my time on Reddit and I know that he likes to bring up his disdain for the monarchy *a lot*. I have absolutely no problem with that whatsoever but this is not the subreddit for him to air his grievances, it goes against the whole ethos of this subs existence, which is supposed to be for light-hearted and good natured content. /r/UnitedKingdom *is* the platform for someone to delve into whether the Monarchy should or should not be disbanded because they enjoy a debate and they are welcome to get as political as they like. Pointing someone towards a subreddit where their argument would be allowed to stand is not being uncasual.</TEXT>

Secondly, they spend more time talking about her rat (fnar) than her property. Not complaining, pet rats are cool. Wouldn't be thrilled about spending  #163;1,100 on a studio flat but if her loan covers most of it, not too much bother. Also, pretty clean / tidy which is a rare treat for these segments.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think the problem with the Anti-Zionist movement is that they are too quick to invoke Godwin's Law into any argument they form. It isn't *valid criticism* of Israel when you froth at the face and screech "u aRe tHe nAzIs" and it completely invalidates any argument you had. Israel is a nation state and you can criticise nation states for their actions. Whether that's Israel, Japan or Tonga, it's fine. Comparing them to Nazis isn't really fair at all and does nothing but attempt to turn Israel into an international pariah of subhumans, something that the Jewish people have experienced many times before.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I ask because whichever team I choose, I more often than not seem to be paired against my rival club in the domestic cups. Currently managing Spurs in my fourth season and I have played Arsenal 6 times. - 3X League Cup third round. - 2X FA Cup third round - 1X FA Cup fourth round This has happened in many other files too, particularly where the opposing team is in the same division. Liverpool, always seemed to play Everton 10 times a season, Newcastle always playing Sunderland 10 times a season. Basically, is it just in my head and I am the unluckiest sod in the world, or is it actually a thing that the game does for the drama?</TEXT>

That said, I'm not a big fan of /r/Vexillology as I feel they've run out of flags and now have "here is the Prussian third infantry division's 1803 flag, but I've coloured it blue rather than the original yellow".

    <TEXT>Used to live in a house share in Southampton with 4 others. Three of them were a bit bland but one of the other boys was really into football, loved a night out and gaming and stuff so we got on brilliantly. One night I had some work drinks, went home about 9pm and fancied going out out, so I tipsily booted his door in to say "come on mate, we're going out". And there I find him, this football mad "lads lads lads girls girls girls" geezer sitting in a darkened room, Lord of the Rings music coming out of his Laptop as he's painting this little figurine of a dwarf warrior in front of his massive terrain. He sheepishly goes "... It's just a hobby". Anyway, we got a big bag of cans in and I helped him paint his models until about 3am, it was great fun! His missus found out about that night and roared with laughter in our faces. Like you, I'm well into my military history and now I collect/build/paint models of tanks. Oh the fun I've had with my Panzer IV Ausf. H.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2018-08-02 16:40:18</DATE>
    <TEXT>I ask because washing up causes much strife in households and every bugger seems to have a different way of going about doing it (if they even do it at all!) I have a dishwasher but I don't really like to use it as it breaks my fancy wine glasses, and it stinks sometimes. Also nothing worse than forgetting to turn it on and then the next day you have no stuff. So for me, I wash up as I go. Compulsive washer. If I've made something delicious in a pan, I'll then get that on my plate and *will not eat* until I have washed up that pan and any other utensils that were used in the process. Then I can eat in peace. The minute I've finished my food, I have to wash up my plate/glass. I find it *so* much easier. Nothing is congealed, nothing has gone hard and grim, no elbow grease is needed. You can basically run it under a tap with a sponge for 5 seconds and you're good to go. Therefore people who pile their dishes up manky.</TEXT>

I remember a post about how in Norway (I think), Christianity in children had dropped to around 1% or something. The comments were praising this news as it meant that education, science etc. were all triumphing and this backwards ideology was dying. Why is that a good thing but hoping that people fall out of love with Islam is a bad thing? Is it because the people who follow Islam are more likely to be foreign, and therefore need to be mollycoddled? Genuine question, no snark.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Genuinely think that Deeney and Gray will come good this year. I would probably play a classic 4-4-1-1 with wide midfielders (Kiko and Sema), Deeney up top and either Gray or Penandindada behind. Central pairing of Doucoure/Chalobah/Cleverly and Hughes to provide some anchorage and some of Hughesies lovely through balls to the strikers or pinging out wide. Lovely stuff, I'll happily take on the first team duties when Gracia is sacked in December. Think we've got one of the best mid-fields outside of the top 6 and Foster and Navarro are solid additions, and I think Sema is genuinely going to be signing of the season for us (for  #163;2m as well). Genuinely really excited about him. Not sold on Masina as I've seen all his old club fans laughing but hey, maybe he'll fit right in. Issue is, we have too many players collecting dead wages. Gomes, Zeegalar, Britos, Holebas, Capoue, Dja Djedje, Foulquier, Janmaat... Just think these are players we should be looking at upgrading now but they are all raking in millions between them which means we can't sign anyone else, and no one wants to sign any of them. We're just running down the clock until their contracts expire and we can free up some cash.</TEXT>

There is only one occasion where we play any of the top 6 back to back (Spurs then Man Utd in September), other than that we have some delightful run of games. Even the first three, home to Brighton, away at Burnley (3 days after they play against whichever Turkish side it is) then home to Palace. If we can get 6 points out of the first 3 games, I'll be feeling confident that we're going to be fine this season.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not poor taste at all! It's encouraged! How else can we prove that our legal system is fair and just, without the layman attending to see the process himself? Whenever I had a free morning at Uni, I would always pop over to Canterbury Crown Court to see what cases were going on that day. Depending on the case it can be very somber, as you can imagine. A murder case where the victims family are sitting next to you in the box is a very uncomfortable experience but an eye opening one, you are literally witnessing a small part of legal history there and then. I hope you do go and experience a case or two. Just remember to be respectful, as I am sure you would be!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Some of my favourite ever players for Watford. (Add yours too).</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-08-10 17:08:53</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hello! I grew up an Arsenal fan. My old man hates football so I didn't really get to watch any and when I did, it was the red cannons (their nickname) as they were good. My cousin was also not a fan of football but he was studying his degree in Watford and he started following them and has since become a massive fan. He started dragging me along with him to shake the Arsenal out. First game I ever saw was when Watford beat Southampton 3-2 back in 2006, two late goals from Darius Henderson and I decided that yep, I am now a yellow insect. Thought it would be fun to put together an XI of my favourite players since 2006 and see how ours all compare! Particularly the fans that have been around for decades, and the youngsters. Going to do a classic 4-4-2. **Goalkeeper** Manuel Almunia for me. Big figure in goal, great shot stopper and the story about him having to move into Arsene Wenger's house because he thought his own house was haunted cemented his place in my heart. Play-off hero, saving Knockaert's penalty. Yes Manuel! Notable mentions to Jonathan Bond and Richard Lee. Saw a big future for Bondy and Lee was spectacularly acrobatic for his short stature as a keeper. **Defenders** Lloyd Doyley. Saw him running away from a bee once, nearly pissed m'self laughing. I was there when he scored his first ever goal, hero. Jay DeMerit. What a story. Seventh tier to the Championship, to Watford captain. Fantastic commanding centre-back, and the kind of personality that our defence needs at the moment. Gabrielle Angella. Genuinely thought he was quality, such a danger from a set piece! Seven goals in a season from corners was incredible. Can't actually remember why we shipped him off. Did I overrate his defensive qualities? Ashley Young. Best youngster I've seen play for Watford. Never got to see him play live as he left the season before I became a proper fan but you could always tell he was destined for the big time and at 33, he's still going. Very disappointed with his return to the Vic the season just gone though, scores two goals and starts cupping his ear? Bit of a dick move. **Midfielders** Ikechi Anya. Talented lad, always felt like he was going to work a bit of magic on that left wing, shimmy past the defender and put the ball in the box. The Scottish Aaron Lennon, unfortunately too light-weight for the PL but served us well in the Championship. Almen Abdi. Loved a set piece. Plonking one right on Angella's big head, 1-0 Watford, cheers mate. Gutted that it didn't really work out in the PL but I think I would have kept him around nonetheless. Nathaniel Chalobah. Perfect loan spell back in 2012 and I was delighted when we made it permanent last summer. Perfect box-to-box midfielder and surely bound to receive a cap this season. G'wan Nate. Roberto Pererya. When he plays well he plays *very well*. Has that bit of class, flair and *luxury* that feels out of place for Watford FC, as if we do not deserve him. He does, however, need to turn it on a little more often. Hopefully this will be his year! **Strikers** Troy Deeney. Easy one considering the fucking dross I've seen up front for us. Watford legend, possibly deserving of a statue when he retires. Feels a pleasure to have witnessed his entire career with Watford. Although fading now, he'll always be the player I tell him kids about. Danny Graham. Considering we bought him for  #163;200k from Carlisle, 41 goals in 98 games was a very solid return! Especially considering those were the years pre-Pozzo when we were out of cash and heading for League One. Only two years at the club but made a huge impact. Always have a little smile when I see he's still banging them in for Blackburn. **Manager** Gianfranco Zola. Delightful man, had us playing some brilliant football with some brilliant players. Loved the fans and they loved him. Shame it fell apart but can't thank him enough for his impact. _______________________________________________________________________________________________ That's it! That's my list of favourite Watford players since I became a fan. There's a few I would love to add, especially from our current crop like Kabasele, Doucoure, Gomes and some of the older lot like Priskin, McAnuff, Mahon etc. but the list would be too long! Probably a few more of the older lot in this list because they were with us when we were struggling financially, and then rising to the Premier League which have had more of an impact on me but I'm hopeful that if I did this in a year or two, the likes of Dellyfeow, Hughes and others will make the list! Looking forward to hearing yours!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Love a weird beverage. At Uni, when I was invited to parties where I only knew a couple of people, to break the ice I would buy a really weird bottle of drink which would usually strike up a conversation. The more disgusting the better really. Worst one I found was Pomegranate Liqueur from some Eastern European country. Brought that along and soon I was in *the inner circle* taking it in turns to do shots of the most horrible drink you've ever consumed. Coffee liqueur sounds pretty decent, is it like Tia Maria?</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; The pride event encompasses a lot more than just rights for homosexuals. I would agree but the particular post was a bus with its number painted in the rainbow flag colour and some comments from gay people stating "I am looking forward to going to the Pride event". Nothing that directly broke the rules. If we look at *things that are encompassed into the political sphere*, we would not have a single post on CasUK as *everything* is within that sphere. The top post right now is someones lawn returning to its former green loveliness which is wonderful but looking at what caused that photo to be taken, it could be argued that it's a piece of commentary towards the changes we are experiencing in our global climate due to the rises in CO2 blah blah poor decisions from former Governments blah survival of the human race. We have to draw a line somewhere and colourful buses wasn't quite there. Earlier this evening we did remove a link to a Government petition advocating greater rights for Trans people. The likes of Moonflower didn't see us removing that link but she would agree with its removal as that is *too* political.</TEXT>

She has a very enjoyable style of writing too, very readable. Unfortunately she flies too close to the sun with her views on CasUK which led to her ban.

    <TEXT> gt; However, I think it #8217;s important to think why something is politically charged and what the motivations behind each post is. This is a good point and something that we do try to do. Last month we moved 3,997 posts. I think I personally removed around 2,500 of them. Things are always going to slip through, like the post from the OP. I saw it earlier on the train and thought "ha, Space Raiders". I didn't actually think it had anything to do with Donald Trump as I had not seen his Space Force news. I have since removed the post. I do think that the OP could have said "this is political because..." rather than jumping to calling us cunts in the modmail.

    <TEXT>I have actually removed the post now that I understand it. I briefly saw it on my commute home and didn't realise it was about Donald Trump. I have been in Edinburgh the last week and left moderating duties to my friends. I have not seen anything about Space Force until this evening so I wasn't sure it was about. If I'd known it earlier, I would have removed the link on sight. Last month we removed 4,000 links under our 'no politics' rule. Don't forget that you only see the very few posts that slip through the net. When you were banned, if you had said "I shouldn't be banned, the photo I commented on was a political post and I was highlighting that", we would have unbanned you and removed the post (we have Automod set up to register, remove and ban people who use words like Trump, Theresa May, Bojo, Tories and all that but the title didn't have any of that). Instead you called us a bunch of cunts which didn't really go down well with anyone, which I think is fair enough. Genuine question. Would you like me to rescind your ban and to let bygones be bygones?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Going to watch England in Volgograd is pretty high up on the list. There were only about 1,000 Brits there and I don't imagine that anyone will ever pay a visit to Volgograd again. Even looking back on it seems like a weird dream. I guess being adopted is up on the list too. Haven't met any other adopted people, I'm sure there are a fair few floating about though. Also I have red hair and green eyes which puts me in something stupid like 0.001% of the worlds population (and in the middle ages was the main sign that someone was a werewolf or a vampire).  gt;Those whose hair is red, of a certain peculiar shade, are unmistakably vampires. It is significant that in ancient Egypt, as Manetho tells us, human sacrifices were offered at the grave of Osiris, and the victims were red-haired men who were burned, their ashes being scattered far and wide by winnowing-fans. It is held by some authorities that this was done to fertilize the fields and produce a bounteous harvest, red-hair symbolizing the golden wealth of the corn. But these men were called Typhonians, and were representatives not of Osiris but of his evil rival Typhon, whose hair was red. Gee, I wonder why the red hair gene is so rare.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Some interesting facts about Watford FC</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-08-13 11:43:30</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm sure none of these are a surprise to the old guard but the new faces might enjoy them. 1. Watford was founded as Watford Rovers in 1881. It then changed its name to West Hertfordshire, before ending up as Watford in 1898. 2. Watford played in blue and white until 1959 where it changed to gold shirts and black shorts. In 1976, a splash of red was introduced and the shirt was changed to yellow which has continued until the present day. 3. Watford and Arsenal have adjacent training grounds, separated by a fence. Troy Deeney could often be seen peering over the fence and bellowing "where u cajones?!" at Arsene Wenger [citation needed]. 4. Watford enter the pitch to the theme tune of Z-Cars from the popular police show 'Z-Cars'. This was manager Bill McGarry's favourite television programme. Everton also enter the pitch to this theme tune, dubbing our matches with them 'the Z-Cars derby'. (If you were the manager, which TV programme theme tune would you go for?) 5. We play Darude - Sandstorm at half time. I'm not sure why but it's good for the memes. 6. The player with the most appearances for the club is Luther Blissett on 415. Lloyd Doyley *almost* managed to beat that, leaving Watford on 402. Blissett left Watford to join AC Milan in 1983 and it is rumoured that the AC Milan manager stated "I want that black chap from Watford", referring to John Barnes but got confused and ended up with Blissett. He then came back to Watford, then left for Bournemouth and then came back a THIRD time! 7. Ross Jenkins made appearances for Watford when they were both 1st and 92nd in the Football League. 8. Aidy Boothroyd is the only ever Watford manager to suffer defeat in the first three games of a season. 9. John Barnes and Luther Blissett are the only players to receive an England cap while on the books at Watford. Can Will Hughes and Nate Chalobah join them? 10. Watford and Brighton  amp; Hove Albion met in the FA Cup in four consecutive seasons in the 1920s  #8211; an occurrence unique in the competition #8217;s history (apart from seemingly every Football Manager file I make).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was expecting a lot more of Brighton. They must have spent around  #163;60m this summer. Granted they were playing their old guard but they looked bad, really bad. Was impressed with Kabasele and Cathcart to be fair, I wasn't thinking "uh-oh" whenever Brighton were on the ball. I don't know much about Masina but *surely* he is more defensively minded and may be used against the better sides while Holebas can meander around against the weaker ones.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Watford loan army - where are they all this season?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-08-13 13:02:48</DATE>
    <TEXT>Don't know why I've posed the title as a question, because I'm going to tell you. (Work is quiet today, can you tell?) **Cucho Hernandez** Our lad is doing another season with SD Huesca where he tore the league up last season. VERY exciting for this season as SD Huesca were promoted to La Liga, meaning we'll see him on the top stage this year against the big boys. If he starts brightly, I can see him picking up a full cap for Colombia which will grant him a visa to play for Watford next season. Fingers crossed! **Tommie Hoban** Tommie is playing at Aberdeen. He has not yet made a first team appearance, although the season is very young. I think we all know that he is probably not going to make it though. **Daniel Bachmann** Oh Danny Boy is at Kilmarnock in the SPL. He is sitting on the bench. Not much else to say really. **Dodi Lukebakio** Dodi is at Fortuna Dusseldorf in the Bundesliga this season, after impressing against them during the pre-season friendly. Fortuna have just been promoted to the Bundesliga so they are probably in for a tough season, hopefully Dodi helps them out! **Jerome Sinclair** On loan with League One Sunderland for the season. Started against Charlton on the opening day and missed an absolute sitter. As in, I would probably have scored it. As in, so would my actual Nan. Still, looked lively and was getting involved a lot. Didn't even make the bench against Luton though, injured or are they fed up of him already? **Randell Williams** He's the lad we picked up from Palace a season or two back. 21 year old winger, we've sent him to Wycome Wanderers back in Jan 18 until Jan 19. He seems to play every game for them, primarily as a striker or an inside forward. I think at 21, League One is probably his level but you never know. **Alex Jakubiak** Striker on loan with Bristol Rovers. Hasn't featured in either of their opening games, hasn't even made the bench. Not sure if he's injured or just a bit poo but it's his 22nd birthday next week and I don't think he'll ever have a future in the Premier League. Contract expires in 2019, I imagine that will be that. ____________________________________________________ **The weird ones** You know, that group of players that you've never heard of but are on our books. **Williams Vel #225;squez** Erm, Venezuelan centre-back who plays for Real Valladolid B in some really lowly Spanish division. **Pervis Estupi #241; #225;n** Ecuadorian left-back who played for Almeria in the Segunda division last season and is now on loan with RCD Mallorca in the same league this season. Actually heard decent things about him and I believe he will be eligible for Spanish citizenship in 2019. Be interesting to see what happens with him. **Jorge Segura** Colombian centre-back playing for Independiente Medellin in Colombia. I'm not going to pretend to know anything about him, or his football club but I do know that Pablo Escobar was from Medellin. Hope that helps. There are quite a few others but they don't have Wikipedia pages so I'm struggling a bit...</TEXT>

To be fair, lots of Spaniards are quite rude, in my experience. I have been nearly pushed in front of a tube train thrice in my time in London, each time has been a Spanish student trying to push their way on, or swinging their backpack around on the platform at peak time, oblivious to everything. And now the UK themed subreddits will be chock full of people belittling and mocking an elderly disabled woman because The Mirror have spun her words a little.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Future features - a wish list.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-08-13 15:03:20</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hello! Avid player for 13 years now, wanted to write a few features that I often dream about when it comes to creating some top notch immersion into Football Manager. Let me know what you think / add some of your own wanted features etc. **Agents** I don't think that players agents cause enough trouble at the moment. Sometimes they pipe up and ask for a new contract for your player at grossly inflated wages but I feel like there could be more drama. Agents leaking bullshit news to the press, claiming that you hate players from Africa or you didn't get your star striker a birthday card (basically anything Yaya's agent has ever done). I don't really get into spats with other managers but I would love a war of words with an agent. **Social interactions with players** Basically a useless feature at the moment.  gt;"Hey you played well today, keep it up!"  gt;"Fuck you". First and foremost, if you want me to chat to my players and or the media, give me some proper real life sentences structures, and base the outcome on stats/personality. I would like some more random events that I can either take charge of, or ignore. Perhaps my U23 player is getting a bit too big for his boots, bought a Lamborghini and it's annoyed my first team. I can have a chat and tell him to wind his neck in if he wants to succeed. Maybe the press have criticised my players' new tattoo and I can back him in the press and tell the media to let his performances do the talking. Maybe you can encourage your players to visit a children's hospital, a school or something on their day off. Maybe that could build some team harmony, or annoy the more selfish players who were looking forward to playing FIFA on their day off. Just a thought! Get the fans involved a bit more. I like the social hub with the twitter feed but the comments are basically all the same. Perhaps you could make a player hated, or loved by the fans. Maybe you lose 3-0 and your players all go and clap the travelling fans but one of your players storms off down the tunnel, always a guaranteed way for your fans to hate that player, and subsequently slag you off for picking him. **3D match engine and features for it** Not a big fan of the 3D but it is growing on me. I think it could be used to revolutionise the training mechanics. Like FIFA, it could be fun to actually watch the training every now and then. Set some drills and properly compare your players as they dribble, shoot, take free kicks, tackle etc. etc. Training is how real life managers select their squads, a feature we don't really have but the potential is there. Doesn't have to be every training session, just whenever you feel like watching and seeing how X is developing, or if someone is having an absolute mare. **Travel / Accommodation** Probably beyond the remit of a Manager but an interesting potential feature. Let's say you're the manager of Burnley. Thursday night and you're playing away in Italy, and then have a Premier League game in England on the Sunday. Game finishes at around 2200hr, it could be fun if you could choose when/how the team gets home. Maybe you opt to fly home that night so that the players can all sleep in their own beds, do their usual routine and get to training in the morning. Maybe you opt to stay in Italy for the night, fly home on Friday and then do your training session on Saturday instead. Either option could provide their own benefits / hinderances which you have to weigh up, depending on who/where you're playing on the Sunday. **Policy** I would like to be able to control policy a little more and to do this I would like the weight / physical parameters to go up and down quicker. Maybe after the off-season, my player with poor discipline comes back 10lbs heavier which has caused his pace to drop 4 points or something. I can then put him on a strict diet, make him do twice the amount of running and shift that 10lbs by the time the season kicks off. Maybe I can add more clauses to a players contract to state that he is not to consume alcohol during the season or I can tear up his contract for  #163;0 (especially if he has been in trouble for going to a nightclub before match day before). Basically I want to have the option to be a colossal wanker (Di Canio at Sunderland) or lenient and loved, but could end up with chunky players. ____________________________________________________ That's all for now! Whenever I close my laptop lid and jump into bed, these are the things that I think of as I drift off to the land of nod. I love the game but I want to feel more *immersed*.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah I think out of all of them it would be my favourite. As things stand we get reputations for being a "good" or "world class" manager who is known for being "media shy" or "outspoken" but I definitely think there could be more in-depth character building. In the real world when a new manager joins your club, you can read pages and pages of material on what his style is, the kind of person he is, what you can expect from the season etc. When I take over a new club, I want the media and the players to know that I am strict dietitian, someone who *will* fine you a weeks wage if you get sent off for a reckless challenge, that I love an inside forward and the for players to think "shit, I don't fit his usual system, I'd better get to the training ground or find a new club". Immerse me, SI!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Disabled elderly woman has a bad holiday in Spain. The Mirror claim that this is because there were 'too many Spanish people', rather than focusing on the fact that she is disabled. /r/UK has a field day with it.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-08-13 18:04:08</DATE>
    <TEXT>What I know of the Mirror is that it is in the same tier as The Sun, not worth anyone wiping their arse on it, filled to the brim with hyperbole and lies, not welcome on /r/UK (unless they're running a story that /r/UK agrees with). Step up to the plate, 81 year old Freda Jackson. An elderly, disabled person who spent  #163;1,100 on a holiday to Benidorm through Thomas Cook. Freda Jackson argued that the hotel was not up to scratch for a disabled person, with too many stairs / floors that Thomas Cook did not mention when she booked the holiday. Thomas Cook changed the date/time of her flights with only a weeks notice. She also found that the Spanish people on holiday in the same resort were unfriendly, with one of them nearly knocking her to the ground. Lastly, she implies that she wanted more English people around. Presumably because she's old and fancied a natter with people, rather than being unable to speak to the locals. Naturally The Mirror has focused on the last point as a way of saying "bigoted old lady HATES Spanish people and wishes they would all fuck off", to the silver trumpets of /r/UK. [Here is the news article](https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/british-woman-81-claims-benidorm-13075153) [Thread on /r/UK](https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/96x2fj/british_woman_81_claims_benidorm_holiday_was/) One point I would like to note is that Thomas Cook have offered to pay back 50% of the cost of the trip. Surely they would not be offering a part refund because "there are too many Spanish people in Spain". They would only be doing this if they felt liable for something (probably her disability, or because they alluded that the hotel would be predominately British). Naturally this is ignored and instead we have the following comments: - Roll on Brexit - Could have bounced down the stairs on your fucking perm, love. - stay in Little England then - Three guesses as to which way this moron voted. - She definitely voted leave. Just makes me wonder how these people can tear into an elderly disabled person who didn't have a nice holiday and then think "we're so progressive". Just read the article and don't form all of your opinions based on the headline of a worthless newspaper.</TEXT>

He just kept repeating "this is not what I would do with my Saturday!!" and "What about the Nazis?!". Makes me wonder how he can watch a war movie without frothing at the mouth.

    <TEXT>Yeah that's the one. Episode one of Series 1 is one of the best pilots I've seen (after Lost). I'd definitely recommend watching the first series. You'll either love it or find it dull and repetitive. I'd say that the characters are a lot better than the story line.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There are a few brilliant ones: - Pablo Escobar tour in Medillin where he meets Pablo's old bodyguard. - Turkmenistan. Really interesting as the dictator there has a weird fascination with collecting Guinness World Records for things like "worlds largest indoor Ferris wheel" and "most marble used in construction". - Benin where he meets a tribe of Voodoo worshipers who just beat each other up for their God. - Myanmar where he meets people who have dinner parties with their dead relatives and stuff. Weird. He usually goes to two places per episode and I found that one is brilliant and the other is a bit naff.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I remember in History in about year 9, we had to do a presentation to the class for about 15 minutes on an interesting person from history. Someone notable, respected, just someone that you thought, they're a cool person and I want to write / talk about them. I love history, particularly the more recent stuff, 1800 to 1950, I'm your man. Naturally I dived right into this project, I was researching, I was practicing my presentation, I was doing slides, the whole works. Presentation day comes. Now, not everyone shared my keen love of history or presentation. The cool kids were up first and their presentations were on the following people; - Michael Jordan. - Steven Gerrard (wtf) - Arsene Wenger - Elvis Presley - ABBA I had strongly misjudged the tone of my classmates and who they considered historically notable. Up steps muggins here do to his presentation on... - Erwin Rommel The blank fucking looks I received when I was presenting on the Desert Fox, fawning over his tactics in North Africa, his plot to kill Hitler and his resultant suicide to ensure his family received his full military pension etc. The only word that anyone picked up on was "Nazis" and I spent the last 5 minutes defending the fact that I was not a Nazi, I just thought Rommel was more interesting and more notable than Steven fucking Gerrard (who, at the time, was probably about 25 years old). I left with the nickname "history boy" which is still thrown my way on the odd occasion when I visit the hometown. Cringe.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have another one from about two years ago. Was at a bonfire night house party with some friends I used to work with. The host is our good pal but he's a fair whack older than us so he's got kids, his brother has kids etc. so it's a mixed bag of 20 somethings getting hammered and kids running around. We were reminiscing about this bellend of a manager we had called DMC. He was called Damien, and he had a massive cock, hence DMC. (Basically he used to stand about a foot away from the urinal so you always got an eyeful when you went into the toilet, so everyone had seen it). One of the girls was asking who DMC was and what the initials were to which my pal says "He's called Damien, and he's got a massive cock!!" Turns around, there's a four year old girl stood there with her Dad, both blank faced. She turns to him and says "massive cock!". Thankfully everyone laughed it off but at the time you could cut the atmosphere with a knife, a proper laugh cringe.</TEXT>

Instead he started cracking out "banter" that just wasn't his to dish out. Calling my mate "a fat cunt" and stuff. The rest of us call him that but that's because there's years of backstory to it, previous holidays, previous times in restaurants where he's described himself as a fat cunt and all that, so when one of us does it everyone else is laughing and reminiscing about where it all started etc. When new face did it, it just put everyone's back up.

    <TITLE>[Pre-Match Thread] Burnley vs Watford</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-08-15 19:09:04</DATE>
    <TEXT>**When**: Sunday 19 August **Where**: Turf Moor, Burnley **Time**: 13:30 **Televised?:** No (fuck off). Potato stream it is. _____________________________________________________ **Watford** **Form**: W **Team News**: Chalobah and Doyleyfeu should be back soon, not sure whether either will make it for the Burnley game though. No injuries sustained in our opening game so I would imagine that Javi will field an unchanged squad. What do you think? ____________________________________________________ **Burnley** **Form:** D **Team News**: Burnley drew 0-0 away at Southampton on the opening game. Looking at the highlights reel, they really should have won if were not for some last ditch defending from Southampton. They have their home game with  #304;stanbul Ba #351;ak #351;ehir F.K. on Thursday. They drew away 0-0 so really they should be looking to win in normal time, or risk being completely knackered for the weekend. Mee, Tarkowski and the fullbacks have started the season well, with new signing Joe Hart in goal. They've also signed Matej Vydra, hopefully he doesn't come back to haunt us. ____________________________________________________ **Whiff Predicts** 1-0 Watford. Doucoure or Capoue, from outside the box. Pererya has been in top form for a while. I predict that he'll end up being marked out of the game by Matthew Lowton who is class, and I imagine that Mee and Tarkowski have enough about them to keep Gray and Deeney out of the game too. Therefore, a long range bombardment is in order and I reckon an absolute rocket from range will see this one through.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The worst part of this thread is that I recognise a hell of a lot of usernames and now I'm realising that I clearly spend my off time at work chatting with children. My only advice for you young'uns going to Uni is, do everything! Get involved with your housemates, join a society or two, or even three! This is a solid chance to reinvent yourself, get off reddit and live a bit. There'll be plenty of time to doss around on the internet when you get a full time career :D Now go and celebrate with a big bag of *cans*, not a bag of *cannots*.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I didn't do a repeat year but a few friends did. One of two things will happen. He'll either get a proper kick up the arse and come out of Uni with a top grade, or he'll do the same thing again and leave with nothing. It's entirely up to him. One of my friends did the kick up the arse route and now works for Jaguar Landrover, sitting on 50 grand a year at 25. Another friend did shit all *again* and now works in the pub that was next to our uni halls. Nothing wrong with working in a pub of course but it's not great when you have  #163;30k of loan to pay back. I would say don't be too hard on him, Uni can be a horrible time, especially if you don't like your course or you haven't made many connections with people. It's a time where you're still transitioning into 'adult life' and this influx of responsibility, all while people prod you and say "so what are you going to do with *the rest of your life?*.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Over on CasUK we've set up AutoMod to flag utterances of political words like BoJo, Trump, Brexit etc. etc. Recently added 'Chav' to the list and honestly, I'm pretty shocked by how often it gets flagged. At least a few times a day. Chavs on estates, in their tracksuits no less! Surely the 'chavs on the estates' are the people that the Labour party and its supporters are supposed to want to help, to encourage them into education and provide some kind of future for them, away from drugs, gangs, violence etc. rather than constantly mocking and belittling them. The way I see Corbyn supporters on reddit is this sort of naff Robin Hood approach of wanting to take from the rich, but slip it into their own pocket.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I am obsessed with butts, they're all I can think about when I'm in public. The grocery store, on the sidewalk, in line at the airport, I'm always aware of every single fit booty within a 50 ft radius around my balls and sack. The first thing I do when I enter any room or walk down an aisle in a store is scan for butts and if I find a good one then I will formulate a quick strategy for looking at that butt as much as possible in a reasonable time frame, of course so as not to seem like a weirdo. I never say anything to the butts owner, I never make more than normal eye contact and a brief smile perhaps, my only goal is to rack up the amount of time that my eyeballs absorb the light that is bouncing off of quality butts. I'm fucking consumed by this and the force that powers my affliction or gift is seemingly never ending.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>How did we all do ladies and gents? I'm sitting pretty on 65 with Salah, Mane and Tomkins to play tonight so with any luck, that could creep into the 80s. Pleased that Will Hughes paid back my trust as my 5.0 midfielder, but annoyed that I kept Ings on the bench for Obamayang - Especially after the latter's *howlers* this weekend. Whoever is leading the CasUK league is sitting on 200th in the World! Used any chips yet? Wildcard still an option? Anyone you want to ship / have your eye on?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's a good moan but it's completely and totally wrong. The fact that clubs have a Category A, B, C and D for every fan to buy tickets goes to show that the clubs themselves very much care about how 'good' and loyal their fans are. Been to 20 games in the last two seasons? Well done, as a reward, you get to pick your seat first, before anyone else. It is nice that there are fans in the United States waking up at 7am to watch their team on the telly but there are other fans waking up at 5am to get a coach to *Burnley* for their team. Their effort should be rewarded, and it is.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Players get a  #163;10 fine and an additional  #163;15 fine for every 5 yellow cards received. The club can also impose a further fine on the player if they want to. For example, Galatasaray tried to fine Sneijder  #163;1.96m for picking up 11 yellows in a season (80% of his annual salary). Whether they were successful or not, I'm not sure. The club will get a  #163;25,000 fine if they pick up 6 or more yellows in a single match.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Recep Yazar for my Spurs team. Half English-Half Turkish, a natural goalscorer. Loaned him out to Burton Albion in the Championship. He scored 22 goals in 35 games at the age of 17. Next season I toyed with keeping him at Spurs but I had Kane and Arkadiusz Milik and was worried he wouldn't get enough games, so I sent him to Stoke in the PL. He scored 4 goals on his debut and ended the season with 32 goals. 54 league goals in 2 seasons and he had just turned 18. Kept him for my Spurs team forever after that, he retired as the all time Premier League top scorer on 338 league goals, including a season where he scored 48 league goals. He also had 150 caps for England and 110 goals. I was beyond gutted when that file got corrupted, never seen a striker like him since. Poor Recep, gone but never forgotten.</TEXT>

Randomly popped up on a scout report at 17, Colombian lad playing in the Colombian league.  #163;180,000 spent for his services and by 21 he was the best central midfielder in the world. By 23 he told me that he felt that he had completed everything he could with my side and wanted a fresh challenge. I had a lot of respect for the way he approached it and so I sold him to PSG, for  #163;165m.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;People who voted Brexit don't hate Europeans,  gt; gt;Of course they bloody do. It was an anti-immigration vote. You can definitely have a more stringent immigration policy without hating foreign people. I have previously dabbled with the idea of doing a year or two in Canada before and their point based system is incredibly stringent. At no point when I was looking at the immigration policy did I think "they hate me and don't want me in Canada", but rather that they wanted to ensure that I would have provided them with skills that would benefit their country.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah absolutely, I think for the Visa I was looking at, you needed a clean criminal record and 2,500 CAD in savings, which is about  #163;1,500. Don't tell /r/UK I said this, but that isn't too demanding. The hardest part is that you need a job offer to be granted the visa, and it *is* difficult to land a job offer in a country that you're not based in. Unfortunately when applying for jobs and met with the question "do you have legal right to live and work in Canada" there is rarely an option to select "not yet".</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I remember a lady on Pointless suggesting 'Paris' as an answer to the question, 'name a country that ends in two consonants'. I do think that a lot of women are pretty bad at Geography and I think a lot of it comes down to football. If you're a football fan, you end up seeing all sorts of interesting flags, you learn about teams from all around the world, countries and continents, the works. There is no reason for my missus, for example, to have heard of Qarabag. Because they play in the Champions League, I know that they are an Azerbaijani team based in Baku. It's just a theory but I do think football helps georgraphical knowledge *a lot*.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It looks like the ultimate origin is unknown but the theory is that it comes from the Proto-Germanic word "raub" which was "to break" or "rob" which leads into the Anglo-Norman "plunder" and "destroy". Proto-Germanic tribes were largely based around modern day Bremen, Hamburg and the Danes, all up in the north. As the Romans and the Germanic tribes didn't get on too well, I wonder where it came from... Did the Romans take it from the Germanic peoples, or vice versa? Quick ~~batman~~ That-There, to history! *Do do do do do do do*. Edit: Hang on, the Goths sacked Rome. *Surely* that's where it comes from for the Latin root.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2018-08-22 11:43:13</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've played a few thousand hours on Football manager but there are still things that I have seen in the real world that I have not seen in the game. - Never seen a goalkeeper score a goal (in 90 minutes, had one take a penalty before). I know it's a rare accomplishment in real life but it does happen every now and then. - Never seen a player score from his own half. Again, a rare feat but I remember the likes of Matty Taylor, Beckham, Xabi Alonso and Wayne Rooney all doing it. - Never seen a goal direct from a corner. I used to go and watch non-league football fairly often where it would happen every now and then (rubbish keeper and windy stadium). - Never seen a big team relegated from the Premier League. Biggest team I have ever seen go down were Everton. I have seen some of you with files where Man Utd are in League One/Two! I'm sure there are others but that's off the top of my head. Have you seen any of the above? Anything else you would add that you haven't seen in FM?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thought this was actually a good article from Sky Sports, few facts and figures thrown in, an all round good read. This 4-4-fucking-2 clearly works, as it did with Ighalo and Deeney all those years ago. The only concern is whether they can keep it up all season. If one gets injured, I'm not sure we have a suitable replacement. Okaka is a bit naff and Success is the Nigerian Welbeck. Could probably see Duleafeo and Deeney working if Gray was injured but not sure about any other combination.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Usually if they don't ask for one. If I feel pressured to leave a tip, I won't. Don't put service charge on the receipt, don't ask me if I would like to leave a tip, I either will or I wont. Horror story from a few years back, had a few drinks with dinner and then I was passed a card machine. Punched in my pin and thought job done. Then the machine went to "enter your pin"... What the hell did I enter? Turns out that the first screen was "eNtER yOuR tIp aMoUnT" and I had entered my pin number as a tip. Lucky waitress got 3 grand. Thankfully it was easily reversed although I did have to wait 5 days to get it back through the bank but fuck me, I thought I was going to have a heart attack when I realised what I had done.</TEXT>

Sounds like kicking the shit out of the terrier was justified here, maybe not killing it but I'm sure anyone would kick a dog a few times if it was trying to kill a family pet.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>He's a friend of a friend. A warrior online but apparently pretty meek and pleasant in person. I never had an issue with him on reddit, he seemed nice enough, a little odd but definitely fell of a sharp cliff and started seeing fascism everywhere he looked. Then there was that chat about how he was planning on sending some kind of malware to the users here, if you remember that. Try my best to just ignore him now. Pops up in CasUK every now and then but we just pass it on to the admins to deal with. RIP /u/Bell_Whifff, /u/TommyIsAPaedo etc. The sad thing is that because the reddit admins have decided they don't want him and that lot around, that just proves to him that it's because they are Nazis. I met Spez at a party about a month back and he's just a nice man who made a website with his friends. I asked him how he deals with being called a Nazi every day and he just said that he doesn't read comments or pings, just lets people scream into the ether while he continues to do reddit CEO things.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[Pre-Match Thread] Watford vs Crystal Palace</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-08-23 16:14:52</DATE>
    <TEXT>**When**: Sunday 26 August **Where**: Vicarage Road, Watford **Time**: 13:30 kick off **Televised?:** Yes!! Sky Sports, live from 12:30. _____________________________________________________ **Watford** **Form**: WW **Team News**: Still no real news on Chalobah and Doyleyfeu other than, they should be back soon. No injuries picked up against Burnley, could well be another unchanged squad. What do you think? ____________________________________________________ **Crystal Palace** **Form:** WL **Team News**: Comfortably beat Fulham away on the opening day but succumbed to a 2-0 defeat at home to Liverpool. Don't let the defeat fool you, they looked very good! Wan-Bissaka will be out, having picked up a straight red against Liverpool. ____________________________________________________ **Whiff Predicts** 1-1 draw. I have never seen a fluid game vs Palace, it always descends into a dirty game of rugby. I see Palace going 1-0 early on, before Deeney bullies their defence enough and we bundle the ball over the line from 1 yard out. Can't wait to see how many foaming faces are visible when Harry goes over to the away end to say hello, and Zaha gets booked for diving.</TEXT>

They'll probably have to fill out some extra paperwork. I had to jump through a load of hoops to go to Russia but I did it, because I wanted to go to Russia. I appreciate that's it's a mild inconvenience but you'll do it if you want to do it. Would never suggest that someone can't moan about it though, I would if I had to do it again to go inter-railing or something.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2018-08-27 23:15:39</DATE>
    <TEXT>This sub is comprised of many wonderful users. Unfortunately, some users are colossal fuck-ups and are happy to take things from hard working people. Remember [this chap](https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/comments/9adwng/hello_rcasualuk_im_looking_for_fellow_uk_dwellers/)? We have substantial evidence that he is a well known reddit scam artist. When we confronted him with the evidence, he has deleted the post and his comments to try and cover his tracks. **If you were planning on sending him anything please do not**. If you have already sent him something, my advice would be to contact the Admins. We're approaching the admins from several fronts, across multiple subreddits where he has operated. All I can say from the mod front is that I am truly sorry that some of you fell foul to this colossal cunt, I am sorry that we did not catch him early on. No idea how he can look at himself in the kitchen mirror. In the interest of transparency, some of the evidence can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/badkarma/comments/9aryxi/uwewantjojivlogs_alt_of_scammer_uxjonlove1993/). Several users know him well.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>**When**: Wednesday 29 August **Where**: Madejski Stadium, Reading **Time**: 20:00 kick off **Televised?:** No. Doubt you'll even get a stream for it tbh. _____________________________________________________ **Watford** **Form**: WWW **Team News**: I am imagining that Dahlberg will get his first game for us which will be fun. Masina, Quina, Navarro and Sema to start? Chalobah and Deaioulafeiou to get some minutes? ____________________________________________________ **Reading** **(League) Form:** LLLDD **Team News**: Started the season *very* badly. Not sure how they'll line up but they have plenty of players that you'll probably recognise! Tyler Blackett, Mo Barrow, John O'Shea, Paul McShane, Sone Aluko, Vito Mannone and others. Also my friend Sam Walker is their second choice goalkeeper. He is very tall. ____________________________________________________ **Whiff Predicts** 3-0 Watford. Don't think Reading will give a flying fuck about this game as they're already joint bottom in the Championship. I think we have plenty of fringe players who will want to impress on a run out.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I sat in the little corner bit of the Elton John vs Brighton and there were about 10 Brighton fans sat behind us. Little bit annoying but they were well behaved (probably helped we battered them). Just sad that we can't fill our ground with Watford fans but the tickets were  #163;40 and we do have a small fan base. Saw that the Pozzos have made the Elton upgradeable into a two tiered stand but I think we're a decade off needing that. Half the time when I get the train from Euston it's full of Americans coming to their first ever PL game, as Watford is the only 'London' side with seats going spare.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not going to be too critical because I imagine that you were absolutely knackered after sleeping in a field for a few days BUT I do think that *everyone* has a personal responsibility to pick up whatever they take along with them. I get that the tent is fucked and probably unusable ever again but it's still your problem that someone else is now dealing with. I'm not going to lie, I used to be a right bellend and I would go drinking with my friends in parks or whatever and just leave bottles or cans lying around. Looking back on it makes me cringe, especially after seeing all these documentaries with animals dying, literal floating islands of trash in places like Indonesia and all of that and now I go out of my way to bin any rubbish I see, even if it's not mine. Can I be really cheeky and recommend that you do that one day, sort of make amends for leaving an old tent in a field? Just pick up an empty can and bin it. Good karma and all that!</TEXT>

I think "anti-war" is kind of a bullshit term anyway as I do not believe that *anyone* can truly be a pacifist for every global conflict, ever. ISIS, for example, are objectively bad and should be destroyed. The fact that they stand for war, death and destruction means that if you *don't* believe that they should be destroyed, you kind of agree with their philosophy and also do not believe in 'anti-war'. Think I've explained this appallingly, I'll try again later.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That poor fella who was on the floor clutching his noggin, then took a bar stool to the back of the head! Just needs someone playing an out of tune piano in the back as bottles smash around his head, someone sliding another person across the bar while a couple of patrons lift their drinks up. Bonus points if the slidee ends up inside the piano, legs dangling out. Then the ~~Sheriff~~ Policeman comes in and ~~fires a Winchester rifle into the ceiling, causing rubble to fall on his deputy~~ taps his baton in his palm and says "what's all this then?"</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That does sound particularly awful. I have a friend who is in underwriting. Small office of 15, they're all in their mid to late twenties, and they're as Essex boy / more money than sense kinda people. Each Friday they have a 'full kit wanker' day where they have to go into the office wearing a full replica football kit. Whoever has the most obscure or impressive kit wins  #163;1,000. So if you ever see someone wearing a full Maccabi Tel Aviv kit (with smart shoes) on the tube at 8am on a Friday, that's why.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah most of it is just clients from my time in the Big 4. I was on 'middle markets' so I had about 40 smaller clients, rather than solely sitting on one massive client like HSBC or something. As a result I worked with these smaller underwriting / insurance companies, smaller banks, media companies and tech companies. Met a load of interesting people with these weird office rituals. For example, the fella who runs JustEat has the title "Lord of the Onion Rings".</TEXT>

The American M2 which is still in service in *most* countries was designed in 1919 and in service from 1933.

    <TEXT>Absolutely size of it. Literally just the one ever built, the Soviets used it to ferry their space shuttles over to modern day Kazakhstan. My understand is that the Soviet Union Airforce basically created a commercial cargo freight company which used this beast to ferry cargo about everywhere. When the Soviet Union broke up, the airline company operating this was in Ukraine so this no longer belongs to the Russians (suckers). Wonder what it's bringing to / taking from the UK.

    <TITLE>The best and worst names.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-08-30 12:18:30</DATE>
    <TEXT>I like names, titles and all of that jazz. The idea that your parents look at your lumpy potato face and decide that you are to be known as *name* for the rest of eternity. Such a personal thing that is not decided by yourself, how odd. Also how close you are to your parents but it is rude to call them by their names, instead having to give them all this generic title of "mum" and "dad". It's all rather interesting. Here are some of the best and the worst names, and a story or two. __________________________________________________ **The time I was in a spy film** Went for a fancy job interview at a fancy law firm. Greeted the busty secretary with a tip of my hat, a wink and a "m'lady" (none of that happened) and then sat down ready for my interview, and buried my face in a copy of the Financial Times (the DOW Jones was down that day, couldn't believe it). Then in comes the slickest rick you've ever seen, dressed to the 9s, absolute swagger and he approaches this lady.  gt;Ah, Mr. Bond? We've been expecting you. Took everything in my will power not to stand up and yelling "YES!!!" in their faces. It was perfect, I bet she was practicing that all morning. Bond is the best surname, I am envious of all the Bond's out there. __________________________________________________ **Unusual / amusing names** - Friend of mine is called Christopher Packett. Chris Packet. - Gary Neville's dad is called 'Neville Neville'. Ha. - Had a boss once called Teresa Green. She never changed it to Teresa Orange during Autumn :( - Adolf. No, seriously. Fella from Zimbabwe who went to my Uni. Adolf. He realised that it wouldn't go down well with the chicas so he told everyone that he was called Justin (he liked Justin Timberlake). An actual Adolf. __________________________________________________ **People whose surname is a country but not the country that they are from.** People with the surname 'Welsh' who are from Kent, or 'English' but are American. Does this happen in other countries? Is Italia a surname? Are there people in the Czech Republic with the surname "Slovakia", and is that a problem? Let me know xx __________________________________________________ **People whose last name is a first name. I don't trust them but I'm not sure why**. People called 'Harvey Thomas' or 'Paul Simon', 'George Lee'. It doesn't sit well with me, particularly in a professional environment when people say "can you reach out to this guy" and you're not sure which is their first name. Nahh, it's not right. __________________________________________________ **People who are named after the thing that is opposite of what they are** Never met a girl called Grace who acts with any of it. They're always the one is covered in bruises because she fell down the stairs, or is dancing like an inflatable tube man in an American car park with her skirt over her head. Knew a girl called Faith. She is both an athiest and an adulterer. Wonder if there are any women in North Korea called Liberty. Probably not. __________________________________________________ **Names that have been ruined by historical people** - Napoleon. It's a pretty cool name, ruined by French imperialism and now reserved as a name for your fat, lazy cat. - Rudolf. Used to be many a Rudolf. Unfortunately, a lot of them ended up joining the Nazis (Hess and H #246;ss spring to mind) and now that's another name that's disappeared. - Rupert. There are some great Ruperts, like Grint, Everett and Bear. However, I am expecting that Murdoch will see the end of Rupert, how sad. __________________________________________________ Yeah I've just rambled on about names for a while. Thanks for listening. Add your name stories and lets make this a party.</TEXT>

Water was pretty undrinkable in the medieval ages (as people didn't understand that defecating in your own well wasn't good for you) so most people drank weak ale. Rumour has it that people who couldn't afford beer were called 'drinkwaters'. It's a pretty shit joke really... It's also a thing in Germany, Trinkwasser is a surname there.</TEXT>

Our atmosphere is PERFECT, the best in Europe we are not matched by any Brexiteer I can think of, we haven't lost to other Tommy Robinson ultras in 20 years. Our mental strength is the greatest it has ever been - from 2 years of mediocrity to this wonderful remainer army marching down to Parliament square with Jeremy Corbyn opening up the Brexiteers like Moses parted the sea.

    <DATE>2018-08-31 10:32:53</DATE>
    <TEXT>**When**: Sunday 2nd September **Where**: Vicarage Road, Watford **Time**: 16:00 kick off **Televised?:** Yes! Live on Sky Sports. ____________________________________________________ **Watford** **(League) Form**: WWW **Team News**: Fresh off a 2-0 win at Reading in the League Cup and adding to the three league wins won in a row, Watford rotated their squad wisely and should have plenty of options to pick from. Chalobah played in the League Cup and could be an option to partner Doucoure in midfield over Capoue if necessary. Other than that, I imagine that Gracia will pick an unchanged team from the side that won their three league games. ____________________________________________________ **Tottenham Hotspur** **(League) Form:** WWW **Team News**: Despite making *no* new signings this summer, Tottenham have also started the season brightly with solid wins away at Newcastle and home to Fulham, before destroying Manchester United 3-0 at Old Trafford. Harry Kane has been scoring in August, Lucas Moura has been dancing past defenders for fun and Hugo Lloris has been dancing through traffic in his car after a night on the wine. ____________________________________________________ **Whiff Predicts** 2-1 Spurs. I'm enjoying the Deeney and Gray partnership and I think we are more than good enough to score on the counter against the big teams. However, Moura vs Holebas is already consuming my nightmares and I think he'll be pinging balls to Kane all game.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah we tend to win two games against the big 6 each season. Last year was good for it, despite a pretty average overall season. Beat Arsenal and Chelsea, drew with Liverpool and Spurs. Think this year I'd feel confident against current United and current Arsenal.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Always been with Barclays and always been very happy with them. Had a panic when I was in Russia because some helmet back in the UK intercepted my new credit card heading to my address and went on a spending spree, as in I had my mobile app open and I could see the tappity tap transactions going ( #163;29.97.  #163;28.00.  #163;29.17) and so on, they rinsed over a grand out of me and I was stuck in another country. Called them up and they were so professional, cancelled the card there and then, handled all the police investigation and that, reimbursed my card within three days *and* to top it off, they paid my  #163;200 phone bill for me as I was calling India from Russia and it was fucking expensive. Go on Barclays!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It is annoying for a lot of people, traversing London is difficult. From my house it takes about an hour to get over to Hammersmith (even though as the crow flies it's 10 miles), which is the same amount of time it takes for me to go home to Brighton. There are plenty of people who have bought or moved to places on the Crossrail line to make their lives a bit easier and now they'll have to have a rubbish commute for 9 months.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If a grown adult wants to be morbidly obese, go for it, absolutely no dramas there. Please do not try and convince the world that it's beautiful, healthy and glamorous, because it's none of those things. I don't think that obese people should be *shamed* for being fat. They also shouldn't be told that they're gorgeous and healthy. There needs to be a middle ground where we say "you're more than welcome to eat and drink what you like, however, it is damaging your body". It's weird how it's accepted that overfeeding your child is tantamount to child abuse, but when you're an adult it's beautiful?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I guess you could argue that most major breakthroughs in medicine come from necessity. Artificial limbs and physiotherapy developing in leaps and bounds due to the horrendous injuries that many soldiers suffered throughout the 20th century, for example. I imagine that the obesity crisis is probably assisting with knowledge/treatment of things like heart disease and diabetes. Although they are damaging themselves, medicine as a whole advances. Then again, I might have just made that up completely.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; Have you perhaps considered that such antagonistic responses are the reason plus-size people have chosen to "fight back" as it were, in such a way? The only reason to promote such body positivity is because they've been subject to such negativity. Completely agree, I really can't get on board with shaming fat people and I am delighted that subreddits like /r/FatPeopleHate were closed down. People are usually quite sympathetic to those who suffer from alcoholism but treat people with dietary problems as almost sub-human despite it being the same root cause, an unhealthy addiction. On top of that, if you call someone a fat cunt, you're going to make them feel bad. To stop themselves from feeling bad, they'll do the thing that makes them happy, eat more  gt; get fatter  gt; cycle repeats. It's not constructive at all.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In my twelve years as a fan, I'm not too sure I *hate* anyone. I mean, I hate Marlon King because of who he is as a person but I cannot deny that he wasn't a great player for us, and his problems weren't related to anything Watfordy. I thought Jordan Stewart was a shit twat but hardly hate him. Same with Holebas too, although he's doing everything in his power this season to make me like him. Is there someone obvious I'm missing who is hated?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Massive shout out to Isaac Success. After him not playing last season and having rampant hooker parties, I was pretty sure he would be sold this summer for pennies on the pound that we bought him for. Perfect super sub so far, and a goal in the cup to boot. He looks fit, hungry to throw himself about and make a right nuisance of himself when we're running the clock down in the final 15. Well done big man.</TEXT>
