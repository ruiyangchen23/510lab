    <TITLE>[SPOILERS] The foreshadowing of The World's End.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2013-08-24 21:23:27</DATE>
    <TEXT>First Post - The start of the Golden Mile. Old Familiar - The gang meet Sam, an old friend. Also a bit of wordplay as it looks strikingly the same as The First Post. The Famous Cock - Gary was barred in his teenage years. The Cross Hands - The first encounter with the Blanks, who use their hands as weapons. As a bonus, the logo has five hands, and there were five teenagers. The Good Companion - Everyone agrees to stick to Gary's plan, being good friends to him in a time of doubt. The Trusty Servant - Reverend Green tells the gang about the Blanks. Two Headed Dog - The twins attack Sam, Steven and Gary. The Mermaid - The Marmalade Sandwich seduce Andy, Peter and Gary, to gain their DNA, much like the Greek sirens. Also, the logo shows the Marmalade Sandwich as mermaids, or sirens. The Beehive - They kick the hornet's nest, metaphorically. Before the King's Head, the gang reunite at the bowls club, like they said in the introduction, and where "things went f*ck up". The Kings Head - Gary continues the Golden Mile on his own, to Andy's anger. The logo of the pub is in the likeness of Simon Pegg, or Gary. The Hole in the Wall - Steven drives into the wall of the pub to rescue Gary and Andy. The World's End - Well... Also, Oliver and Peter die where they stopped the last time on the pub crawl. With foreshadowing to that during the conversation about 'The Five Musketeers'. Minor things include Gary's mum, Oliver's birthmark and the statues face is the same shape as the Network's form.

    <TEXT>The idea is that all of these episodes are in the near future, right? Well for context, the way British number plates work is that that the first two letters are a local identifier, the two numbers are the date the plate was printed, and the final three letters are random. So for instance, 'BD06 GHA' would mean it was made in Birmingham in 2006. Now look [here.](http://i.imgur.com/kvNflpp.png) The police car's number plate says '17'. That plate is by definition, one from the future. The ambulance one, which I can't get a good screenshot of, says '69' (which means the second half of 2019). Nice little touch that the directors added. :D</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I know this sounds petty but it is a really irritating bug/feature. I use the keyboard to control the videos, like using: J for going back ten seconds K for pause L for jumping forward ten seconds M for mute But whenever a video loads, it selects the search bad so whenever I try these commands it just ends up searching shit like "lllljljlkjklj" with the suggestions blocking the video. Is there any way to fix this or am I stuck with it? I don't have any extensions that affect YouTube either, if that's any help.</TEXT>

A show about professionals actually working towards something that they really want, like cooking for a royal or something, but it's not completely about the drama. All the contestants are Michelin star level chefs and basically always know each other, so there's a nice atmosphere as you get to learn the proper ins and outs of gourmet cooking, because the judges **really** know what they're talking about in this one!</TEXT>

If you view sin as inherently human, then no, God sees all sin as somewhat equal as you will still be condemned to the same place for not repenting said sin. However, that thinking doesn't really scan in the tangible world, where killing is absolutely worse than something like adultery. It's a bastard to unpack and is just overly complicated.

    <TEXT>I loathe Kill the Moon. Not even a big fan of Day of the Moon but it's got my vote as a matter of principle. Rose/Voyage of the Damned was actually quite a hard choice for me. Rose has the notion it's the pilot of the reboot, but hot diggity that's some aged CGI. Voyage is also quite good, although it was way too focused on the guest star (Kylie). I think for having the guts to say to the audience that sometimes you don't get to choose who you save, and that the ones you save can be dicks, I'm giving it to Voyage. It's a good episode, I feel!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Breaking Bad did not glorify meth-making. It showed a complete story of how a meek chemistry teacher was so corrupted by the new criminal life he sought that he destroyed everyone #8217;s lives around him. Shows can portray a bad thing without glorifying them. 13 Reasons Why showed how suicide was the smartest thing that this girl could have done to get back at her friends. Ergo, glorifying it. If they showed how suicide was destructive to everyone even remotely involved in it, you #8217;d have a point. 13 Reasons Why shows suicide as being a trump card instead of a final solution. That #8217;s fucked up.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Honourable Mention: **Heaven Sent/Hell Bent**: If I'm gonna group two-parters, then I can't in good conscience put these two in the top ten. Heaven Sent on its own merit would be placed at a roundabout 3, possibly 2, but Hell Bent drags it down so much. I do not like that they subverted the return of Gallifrey, a running theme for 10 years prior, for more melodrama with Clara. Together, they just miss the list... x. **Blink**: It's good, but I don't think it's as good as what young me might say. It's not like it's not 'held up', it's just that my opinions shifted a bit. Still great though! ix. **The Zygon Invasion/The Zygon Inversion**: This gets its place for the acting alone. Jenna Coleman as Bonnie was sublime and Capaldi's speech is an all-time great. Might have been higher if it had been more than just the speech, but the speech is mighty fine! viii. **Twice Upon a Time**: Great concept, great characters, great "villain" and the best last words for a Doctor yet. Just could have lost the overt mockery of the 1st Doctor's sexism. Too on the nose to be considered that funny. That and the inclusion of Bill started great but it really started to peter out by the end. The good outweighs the bad, but the bad is still there here... vii. **The Beast Below**: Really nice episode with some good themes, I think it's highly underrated vi. **The Husbands of River Song**: It's got a funny first two acts that are just fun to watch, and a delight, but that last act is some kind of spectacle. It is just so, so good. Moffat botched the middle of River Song's story, but he nailed the beginning and the end, which bring me to... v. **Silence in the Library/Forest of the Dead**: An introduction to an enigmatic character, wonderful sideplots and a villain that was genuinely quite scary. Kudos, I enjoyed it thoroughly iv. **The Day of the Doctor**: Yeah it's shlock, but for the 50th, did we expect anything else? It's a delight to watch again and again because it's weirdly both nostalgic and forwards character. I like it! iii. **The Girl in the Fireplace**: It's timeless (ha!). It's so complicated and Moffat really showing the meat of what he and others can achieve with the concept of time travel! So much good character work and nuances, like the idea that Reinette is fine with the Doctor also loving Rose because of the flexibility the French upper-class had with consorts. It's just brilliant. ii. **World Enough and Time/The Doctor Falls**: Where to begin, with the perfect first-parter and an admittedly not-quite-as-great second part (not to say it isn't bad, it's still amazing). The chemistry that flies between all the characters is nothing short of flawless, and the fate of both Bill and the Doctor, and potentially Nardole, being heartbreaking. This is a tragic set of episodes, and I couldn't have asked it to be better. i. **The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances**: If number 2 had a perfect first-parter and only a near-perfect second part, then here is perfection throughout. It's been said enough why these episodes are amazing, so I'll leave it to them to say why. Whatever the subject matter is in production, this episode is perfect doing it. I love it. It's so good.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Match 25 is interesting, and I do quite like it when two episodes I don't like go up against one another. Flesh and Stone helped ruin a perfectly good villain, and Closing Time helped solidify the problem Doctor Who was having at the time which was this constant motif of "love conquers all". Based on what I do like, I did like Bob as a concept, or a vassal for the Angels to communicate. That was interesting. I also liked more of Craig, because he's a fun character. Ultimately, it boils down to what I enjoyed more, which by all counts is **Closing Time**, simply because it was a subpar episode of its own merits, rather than Flesh and Stone which is subpar and drags other things with it. Match 26 is also interesting. I like Army of Ghosts, but Doomsday is better. Army of Ghosts is genuinely enjoyable but the scale of the issue doesn't feel finale-worthy until the final 10 minutes. A fun romp until shit gets mega-serious, maybe, which is a nice change of pace and I do appreciate it for what it is, but maybe I like the scale being given to us from the get go. Partners in Crime is the way to do a fun romp, as it really allows the reintroduction of Donna to shine, and it knows what it is from the first scene. A genuinely amazing companion introductory episode, with The Doctor's and Donna's chemistry being there like it never left. **Partners in Crime** gets my vote</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ooooo. Match 31 is kinda cool. It's a shit episode against a dull episode. ItFotN is pitifully bad. Nothing happens and then nothing happens. It's preachy to the point of indolence and I loathe it. **The Doctor, the Widow and the Wardrobe** gets my vote for trying. Although it's still terrible and in my bottom five episodes of all time. It got lucky this round. ItFotN is straight up bottom. Match 32 is also cool! Dalek is the first episode I truly loved and rewatching it is always a genuine pleasure. Face the Raven had a Clara arc end well (I'm ignoring Hell Bent for now)! Holy shit! Clara's series nine arc is so underappreciated, I feel. She becomes utterly reckless because of complete grief. The only solace she finds is trying to be like the Doctor and it bites her in the arse in the most severe way. That's fantastic storytelling with a fitting "end" (I'm still ignoring Hell Bent!). Dalek as a standalone episode is brilliant. It shows the Doctor's personality, it shows Rose's compassion, it humanises an unforgivable monster. Oh! So good! Love it! But I gotta give it to **Face the Raven**. I cannot fathom how good that episode was. Yeah it was neutered by Hell Bent but hot damn, for what it was, it was ballsy and new and I fucking love it. ADDENDUM: Letitia Wright, who plays Anahson in Face the Raven, is electric in Black Panther, and I'm so happy for her. If you enjoyed her performance in Doctor Who, you'll love her performance in that even more.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>\#1 [William Onyeabor - Fantastic Man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBZltuHcpVo) Review: This was nice and upbeat! I genuinely quite enjoyed this. Proper song that'd lift my spirits on a bad day. I was bobbing my head throughout! Aaaaaah this was so good! **9/10** \#2 [Tinariwen - Oualahila Ar Tesninam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCU_jXs827M) Review: Well this was different. Which is good because I f'kin like different kinds of music. This had great vocals, which made the song great to listen to. I would say the bassline got a bit repetitive at times, but it didn't diminish from my enjoyment! **7/10** \#3 [The Kinks - Act Nice and Gentle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZU-1Fjb_TA) Review: My dad's favourite karaoke band! Hell yeah! You've got great taste, /u/LivinDavideLoca! I can't say I've heard this one, but it was The Kinks. I love me The Kinks. Has a Beatles twang to it! It's nice. And gentle. Heh. **8/10** \#4 [Marvin Gaye - This Love Starved Heart of Mine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq1HmQIzkJI) Review: Marvin Gaye's vocals are just straight up incredible. I could only wish to have the same vocal range as that man. This is no exception. My favourite of the bunch so far. It's technically sound and stunning to hear. Love it! **9.5/10** \#5 [Bombay Bicycle Club - Overdone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nzztt2NimXc) Review: And Marvin got beaten immediately. Woah. Mix of genre is risky but Overdone did it perfectly. The interludes are incredible, the vocals are brilliant. This song was immediately bought by me. I'll be singing this one for years to come. Thank you for introducing me to them! :D **10/10**</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Match 51: I vote for **Last Christmas** on account of it being not Sleep No More. Match 52: I'm not actually a fan of the overall arc of Series 6. I found it to be a bit too whimsical, which is strange seeing how they were trying to make it gritty. I do like the Silence's design/concept and this episode is intriguing as an introduction for them, so as a standalone, I do quite like this episode. **Planet of the Ood** however, deals with themes that I didn't really expect from Who, though. The concept that the Doctor was morally wrong about this race he'd met before, and that they actually do suffer. The whole idea of the Ood being empaths (with a neat callback to The Sensorites) was nice, as it gave a lot of character to them. I genuinely think this episode is really underrated. Donna has a good showing as well!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This week for me is sponsored by /u/insanityarise **Anthroprophh - Dead Inside** I weirdly like distorted songs. This fits a real niche I enjoy. Really liked this one! **Rivers of Nihil - The Silent Life** Again, I wouldn't say I'm a metal fan, and while the vocals are a bit too much for me, this has a killer riff and drums. I wouldn't protest listening to this, but I wouldn't jump up and down to hear it again. Surprise sax was real nice, though. I might end up warming to this, come to think of it **Clown Core - Hell** It's insane. It's bonkers. I love it. I really am a sucker for weird... **I Poisoned Your Guide Dog So You Would Walk In Front Of Traffic - Cumbomb** Nah, if I'm honest, a bit too much for me... too much going on for me to enjoy individual parts... :/ **Vero - Somali Yacht Club** It's an anthem, and the best on this list. Genuinely bought this as soon as I finished hearing it. Might have found a new band to follow. Thanks for this, man! It was great! :D</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Its whole shtick is about how it's sex-positive and beneficial for men to use it, but any company that acts as a sideline for men to actually see a doctor about erectile dysfunction, 'saving' them from the 'embarassment' of going, is anti-sex positive in my eyes. It perpetuates this idea that men have to go through other methods of obtaining drugs like Viagra. That and I find it very suspect that they use their own doctors to evaluate whether or not you need a prescription. Their own staff will want to sell their own product, which I think is a huge conflict of interest.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes I'm sure they planned this baby meticulously and it wasn't just a mistake that happened. They wanted this baby. Absolutely looked at Emily Blunt's ovulation cycle to find the best day to conceive. As for not trying to terminate? I can believe that they wouldn't know how to terminate safely. And if they did, the drugs that might be necessary wouldn't work as well as they should, or at the least pose a huge health risk because of the effectiveness of drugs wearing off because of best-before dates, with coathangers being insanely dangerous and painful, which would make her scream. You saw them give grace before dinner. Maybe it was a religious decision? A wrong one? Maybe, but since when were humans infallible in a constant stress environment?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>*Match 6:* I'm doing this one first because it's somewhat easier, yet still kind of hard. The Day of the Doctor is a fantastic romp. Doomsday is a fantastic tragedy. They are good in different ways, but if I had to rewatch one like right now, it would be **The Day of the Doctor**. I think it's just a bit more enjoyable than the other. *Match 5:* This is the kind of thing I love because this, by design, has to have more thought put into it as they are two halves of a whole. There are *very* few two-parter episodes where I could definitively say where one was better than the other, because they feed off of each other. World Enough and Time is an episode that really played with the concept of time travel in a way that we haven't seen since The Girl in the Fireplace, with time displacement taking a central theme. The way they did this with the black hole was nothing short of genius. That and the CG for both the ship and the black hole itself were stunning. Aside from that, and the interesting concept, this episode was straight up terrifying! I'm somewhat glad I was an adult when I was watching it because child-me would have basically shit himself. Adult me nearly did. The painfully slow reveal of what the cloaked patients were was agonising, in more ways than one, as we saw them scream in pain for all of their waking hours and watch them slowly evolve into what we know as the Mondasian Cybermen. That was nothing short of a story-writing masterclass from Moffat, and I'm not normally one to praise his showrunning tenure. It was sublime. Pearl Mackie's performance was absolutely incredible in this as well, I truly believed she was clinging to any shred of hope she could. A minor drawback was Simm's performance, because I saw through it immediately, and I think I would have had I not known the reveal beforehand... The Doctor Falls is brilliant in a different way, because it went in a completely different direction! The balls to do that in a finale is immense. Heaven Sent/Hell Bent did it, I suppose but Hell Bent kind of fell flat from doing that, while The Doctor Falls completely thrived off of it. The universe isn't in danger, the world isn't going to blow up, it's the Doctor doing what he can to save a single ship of people from an oncoming threat, to the best of his ability. The speech he gives sums it up perfectly, I feel. He's not going to win, but he'll die trying, because it's simply the right thing to do. Bill was heartbreaking, and I like that they kiiiinda (key word here, I'm not too hung up on the Heather return, but it did take some of the impact away) stuck with the idea that she's a Cyberman now, and there's not a lot the Doctor can do. The Missy/Master arc was great, with a fantastic metaphor for how they will be their own undoing, and the tragedy that the Doctor will never know that Missy wanted to stand with him instead of against him. Tying up a character arc that's lasted for *46* years is no mean feat, and it was done to the best of their abilities. Nardole was a nice foil, and being left behind to fight the unfightable was really heartbreaking, but what was necessary for the chance to survive. The Doctor's story tying into Twice Upon A Time was nice, with him not wanting to change again because of fatigue was a really interesting character touch, and I kind of liked it. Both are near perfect, but typing it out, I have to edge it to **The Doctor Falls**. It just did so much *right* in such a short amount of time. What an episode. What a two-parter. Damn this tournament for matching them together because that was HARD.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'll answer what I can... I'm certainly no final authority, but here's what I'd say for a few of the questions. * I think it'd be fine if you found your own accommodation. * Spare time is what you make of it, really. Do the work necessary and don't prioritise your free time to the point where it's all you're doing, but you should have a fair amount of it I should reckon. * Part time work? Piss easy to find, my friend. Retail's always accepting somewhere. * For a pool/snooker society, I think they're common-ish. My campus has a grand total of about 500 people and we're getting one next year as far as I know. At the very worst, you could make the society yourself.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well this is somewhat disturbing. There's a lot of questions here, like: * Why would you post a picture of someone you (allegedly) know and then declare "I MASTURBATE TO THIS PERSON"? * Why should they have to prove they know the person? That's asking for doxxing and is the only thing the OP has going for him. Not that it matters, because he thinks sharing images of his friends on a massive public forum and declaring masturbation is a normal thing to do. * Why is this so vitriolic and fast moving? Why is this the hill they're dying on? * ...why? This is insanity.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm gonna go for **Human Nature** on this one. I think the human element of the Doctor being fully explored was such a wonderful concept. David showed a hell of a range with this episode. This isn't to detract from Silence in the Library, though. It's a great episode with another great concept being added in the form of an out-of-sync companion! I just think fundamentally delving into the Doctor's psyche is somewhat more interesting than a new face we haven't seen. It's a 9/10 vs a 10/10 for me, though. It *was* close and they *are* both excellent.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Seasons 9 and 10 were outstanding. Yeah Hell Bent fell flat on its arse, but I'll be damned if I don't say that everything that preceded it was excellent (except Sleep No More, never Sleep No More). And then Season 10 had the greatest finale since Parting of the Ways, which is an incredible achievement, and I really only hold Parting of the Ways over The Doctor Falls because of the impact it had on me as a small child. Objectively, The Doctor Falls is not only the best finale, but one of the best episodes. I maintain being a skeptic to Moffat somewhat because I wasn't a big fan of Season 5 because it wasn't my kind of show. I recognise it was good for what it was though, it just... wasn't my cup of tea. With seasons 6-8 however, it got worse and worse. I'm glad that Moffat managed to end on a high, and what a damn high it was too, but the high shouldn't have taken 4-5 years to get there...</TEXT>

Matt Smith's era is the weaker to me for the script problems I believe it to have. But Matt was told to act it that certain way and he delivered. What we got was good in terms of acting, but it also should have also been a lot better in what it wanted to present.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It sounds weird, but I think this is perfect for him.

After that he #8217;s used that fame to do his own thing even better than before and create new opportunities. Now he #8217;s done that, he can come back for a good pop as well. I don #8217;t think it could be much better. If he stayed all the way through, he may have been overexposed and become a bit of a dud.

    <TEXT>Well shoot. I was hoping for Midnight to go against The Witch's Familiar so it could go to the final. What a run it had in this tournament. It truly is an immense episode. The Doctor defeated in all senses. His curiosity twisted into fear. His leadership contorted into vitriol against him. His alien nature being a divisive nature. His talkativeness literally thrown back at him. They say curiosity killed the cat, but this time it was the hostess who brought him back. I love that it was an unnamed 'no-one' who saved the day. The Doctor tried to make a name for himself to quell the situation and he was targeted from all sides because of it. It was the hostess, who no-one knew, who was the deciding factor. But... **The Doctor Falls**. The Doctor doing what he can for a doomed people, not because he has stakes, but because it's just the right thing to do. It's low stakes compared to every other finale, but it hits harder all the more for it. Bill dies. She is a tragic story and she suffers. The Master/Missy dies. They are a culmination of a 46 year story and it's ended perfectly. The Doctor dies (for all intents and purposes). He saved the people of the Mondasian ship some time, but had to sacrifice himself to do it. Tragedy is poetry when you do it right, and to me, this is one of the most poetic episodes not only of Doctor Who, but of all television. It is near-perfection.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't like a TV show that they do and that's why they're fucking with the character. No really. There's no connection between the two. No grand story that interweaves how my enjoyment of Stargate is essential to the campaign. We had a discussion about how I watched Stargate's first season, and I wasn't impressed and wasn't planning on watching any more. They were adamant I'd like it if I watched the entirety of the show, but I told them I didn't really like the idea of committing to a show I didn't like. Anyway, it's irrelevant. Their response was to declare that they're gonna fuck with my character because I was being so 'stubborn' about it. I think it's a weird way to bring me into their line of thinking, or punishing my 'wrong' opinion... Am I going crazy? That's not fair, is it? Casting aside who's right or not in the argument, bringing D amp;D into an unrelated argument to punish me isn't right, surely?</TEXT>

Other than that, a fair few years of hope because it looked a good squad on paper, but then squandered it, with a season so bad we pitch-invaded at not getting relegated sprinkled in for good measure.

    <TEXT>Despite being 13th, I'm not gonna sit here and complain overly at being undefeated. We've got some points we straight up did not deserve because of some super-subs. However, Karanka needs to sort this defence out, and it's annoying since defence is supposed to be his thing. We're good on paper, but we're not gelling right, and it's starting to get annoying. The Birmingham game was just a straight up bad performance and I hope to never see us play like that again.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; It's this type of mentality that keeps people who have suffered abuse to stay quiet. I don't think that equates to this context. Mikey is a content producer, which to me is another word for public speaker, and he's putting his content, or speech, on a public forum which should be open for discussion. Limiting that to the point wherein I have to use the reddit search bar to find an obscure subreddit so I can talk about the video is incredibly limiting. Say what you want about the toxicity of a fanbase or the state of the YouTube comment section, removing that choice is only ever going to backfire. It's like if someone on reddit decided to post a discussion thread but then got the mods to lock the comments so that no discussion could be had. Mikey said in the opening that he knew that this video would be divisive. He shouldn't try and stifle that, that never ends well.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If you ever get the chance, I recommend subscribing to /r/panelshow and looking out for when tickets for when Taskmaster filming are available. It's relatively easy to get them and they're free. Two of the best days out I've ever had. You might even see me in the second episode, I was on the balcony! :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sentimental value always means a lot, so I can see that. I'm glad that it means a lot to you. Just because I don't like it, it doesn't mean I can't see the value it has in others. :)</TEXT>
