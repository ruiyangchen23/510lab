    <TEXT>It might be slight off topic, but I remember Mahela Jayawardne first saying in 2012 that he would never appeal for Mankading when Ashwin tried dismissing Thirimane. Later in 2014, he defended Mankading when Sri Lanka dismissed Jos Buttler in this manner. I lost a lot of respect for him that time. You can't just call it against the spirit of game and then defend it when your team does it.

    <TEXT>Taxi Driver is the only answer for me. It captured the feeling of loneliness like no other movie, without relying on physical isolation. And of course, Robert de Niro killed it as Travis Buckle. The scene where he's watching TV with a gun in his hand is really epic. It really conveys the confusion and aimlessness that comes with loneliness. Side note : Late for the Sky is an amazing song which really complements the tone of this movie.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It was a 10-over match for a club when I was 12 or 13. I opened the bowling and got the opener caught at mid off on the first ball. Then came back to bowl the last over and got a hattrick to finish of the tail. I remember the sequence of the hattrick was caught at slip, bowled and the last one was lbw. My final figures were 4-4 in 1.3 overs. The opponents were dismissed for 63 all out in 9.3 overs. Later, I was sent to bat when we needed 2 runs off the last ball as the top order collapsed. I was not a good batsman at all and a bad runner, but I managed to take a single and tie the match. Great times!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>And it's not just her. A lot of the times, the covers of songs used in recent movies do not do justice to the original song. For example, for such a music-focused film, the cover for 'I Ran So Far Away' used in La La Land sounded too much hipster-like and it essentially lost the classic 80s charm of the original song by the A Flock of Seagulls. I must say this, I don't have anything against covers and it is certainly okay for artists to have their own take on classic songs. It's when these covers are clearly uninspired and generic that bothers me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not sure why you're being down voted. I guess people don't even care much about comics and they just want their favorite actors for every role. Bryan Cranston is an excellent actor, but Lex Luthor is not that much older than Superman, whereas Bryan looks old enough to be Cavill's dad. I would have liked Joaquin Phoenix for the role.

    <TEXT>Sobers is not the most balanced all-rounder in any way. He was an all time great batsman who was a very decent bowler. But he was not someone who could make the squad on his bowling alone. I'd say Keith Miller would be the most balanced all-rounder ever. Or maybe Botham in his prime years.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Viv Richards was once given man of the match for taking 3 catches in an ODI. He did not bat in the WI innings and had bowling figures of 0-21 in 4 overs. So the award was given solely for fielding. Edit: [Here's the link for the match.](http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/65931.html) Haynes and Richardson scored fifties and Walsh took 3 wickets, so it's not like there were no other choices.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>They should have picked Bhuvi/Kuldeep. Hardik Pandya is an okayish bowler who can slip in 5-6 overs in limited overs, but he won't be threatening in tests at all. Plus, he'll be batting at 8, so not like India will need his batting, especially with Jadeja already there. This seems to be a defensive approach for India when they should've looked for good bowlers to take 20 wickets on this pitch.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Help In Finding a Justice League story</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-07-30 13:24:25</DATE>
    <TEXT>I remember reading a Justice League story which has the Justice League (Superman, Wonder Woman, Flash, Green Lantern and the Atom) shrinking and going inside a little boy's eye who has a tumor or something. They discover a civilization is living inside the kid's eye. Then they are captured and a bunch of shit happens and it ends with a throwback to the destruction of Krypton. It was a short story (about 30-40 pages I think) and it was definitely published in the late 90s or early 2000s. Can anyone tell me which story was this?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>These are the batsman I have seen play so it's only from 2000s onward: **Sachin Tendulkar** - Kind of an obvious choice. Scored runs almost at will for decades. **Brian Lara** - Another obvious choice. Possibly the greatest test batsman I have seen playing. **Ricky Ponting** - Really loved the way he used to dominate attacks from the get go. **Rahul David** - Who can forget the 180 in 2001, or the 148 in 2002, or the 233 in 2003 or the 270 in 2004. He really had a hand in most of India's memorable victories during his time. **Graeme Smith** - Kind of a personal choice. Really loved his mental toughness and his ability to score runs under immense pressure.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In the 2000s, the Australian domestic First Class matches used to have some of the best players in the world playing (due to the small number of teams and high number of world class players). So, your argument should not be restricted to only T20s. International matches are international at the end of the day. You can't really count a domestic match in international rankings, no matter how important the league is.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2018-01-18 12:25:00</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi, so I have been thinking about starting New Vegas because of all the good stuff I have heard about it. The thing is, I am kind of worried about the graphics and game mechanics being a little outdated because the game is 7 years old. Can anyone tell me about a few essential mods I can install to make the experience better. PS: I have a half-decent gaming PC, so I don't really need mods which are too demanding. I mean, I was able to play Prey and Titanfall 2 on it, but couldn't play Arkham Knight or Witcher 3 on a decent fps. So even if there are mods that make it look like Skyrim, I will be happy with that. I don't really need the graphics to look like Fallout 4 or something.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is one of those scenarios where just looking at the scorecard doesn't tell the whole story. Dravid came to bat at 17-3 and ensured that they reach a respectable total with his 66 which was a turning point in the match. On the other hand, Rajasthan were already reeling at 28-5 in 9 overs when Kumble came onto bowl. The match was already out of their hands at that time since they needed 106 off 66 balls with just 5 wickets in hand. The only recognized batsman Kumble dismissed was Yusuf Patha (next best was Jadeja). So you really need to look at these performances in the context of this match.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Enemies Not Dropping Blood Samples</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-06-25 19:03:08</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I've been playing Vampyr for the past week and reached Chapter 6. Since the enemies are all 30+ levels I thought it would be wise to stock up on potions for the final battles. However, the Skals have suddenly stopped dropping blood samples for the most part, and in some cases don't drop any loot at all. After killing 15-20 Skals, I got like 2 sturdy an 2 rich blood samples It has made the last couple of hours really difficult and I imagine the final battle will be near impossible to win if I don't have any potions. Can anyone tell me if it is a glitch or something?</TEXT>

Being a Reeeemale, she didn't understand this and told me to go see a doctor. The doctor turned out to be a hot gamer girl (HOT) and we had ton of sex.</TITLE>

    <TEXT>Not a 2018 movie, but I watched BvS last night and it still holds up. I think that's the best movie I watched this year. I'm still finding new details in the movie after watching it fifty times. For instance, do you know that Jeremy Irons playing Alfred is a reference to the fact that he played Scar in Lion King. In this movie he takes care of the main character after his dad died, while in Lion King he was the one who killed the dad of the main character. It's a nice touch. Also, Batman being played by Ben Affleck is another reference to the fact that he played a blind vigilante in Daredevil while in this movie he plays a vigilante with a bat motif, which is essentially a blind rat. Plus, Henry Cavill playing Superman and fighting and then teaming up with Batman is a reference to the fact that he starred as a spy in Man From U. N. C. L. E. which had Armie Hammer, who was set to play Batman in Justice League: Mortal. So many layers. Everything else is liberal SJW crap.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Aside from the fact that Les Mis #233;rables was not really that good a movie, he's also wrong about the movie being practically a flop. It made 441 million on a budget of 60 million, which is more than 7 times its budget. Sure it is nowhere close to Infinity War's 2 billion but then again Infinity War had a budget five times that of Les Mis #233;rables. No way it would be considered a flop.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>3 Idiots! Aamir Khan's character is basically a Gary Stu who is good at literally everything while the other two are just there to follow him and make him look even better in comparison. It offers overly simplistic solutions and is so far removed from the reality that it might as well be a fantasy movie. The jokes are cringey at times an the overall tone is so preachy that it comes across as really ham fisted. Also, it doesn't make sense to cast middle aged guys as college kids. Hate to say this, but the book was much better than the movies. At least it showed that just following the dreams do not mean instant and guaranteed success. Even the suicide attempt is handled better in the book whereas in movie it just makes it seem like they are either making a mockery of the situation or adding needles melodrama.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>He averages close to 40 in ODIs since 2017. He's hardly been a decent bowler in ODIs and hasn't performed much except for a five wicket haul against Sri Lanka. Even his career average is 38. It remains to be seen if he's cut out for ODIs. The whole Bhuvi is a top ODI bowler is kind of a myth tbh. Wish Shami was fit, he has easily been India's best ODI bowler in the past 3-4 years but sadly he's not at his best currently.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Back in the first month of college, one of my friends called me up at 6 in the morning on a Sunday. Someone had locked his room from outside as a prank and he was stuck inside. I picked up the call half-asleep as he told me to come to his room and let him out. I said okay and then promptly went back to sleep. When I woke up I had forgotten all about the phone call. When I met him the next day he asked me why I didn't come to help him out. I told him I never received a call. It was only when I checked the call log that I realized what had happened. I apologized and everything but we stopped being good friends after a couple of months (not necessarily because of this).</TEXT>
