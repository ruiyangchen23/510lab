    <TITLE>Want to get into the comics but don't know where to start? This should help.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2013-03-12 00:33:20</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've been meaning to post this regularly here (I get no karma for it) since this gets asked every day and the mods won't put it in the sidebar, however I'm always seeing incorrect information given when people ask this. I know the intentions are good, but its still incorrect info. So without further adieu: **"Where to start with the comics?"** ^^taken ^^from ^^that ^^"other" ^^WD ^^subreddit -------------------------------------------------- The comic book was released by Image Comics in October 2003. New issues are released every month, and currently on #107. If you want to start, here's the breakdown and best method. - Comic Book = 1 issue (Prices vary, though cover price is $2.99, that's only for the current issue) - Trade Paperback (volumes) = 6 issues (~~~$14.99~~ $9.00 on Amazon) - Hardcover Book (books) = 12 issues/2 Trade Paperbacks (~$20.00) [contains original comic covers] - Compendium = 48 issues/4 Books/8 Trade Paperbacks (~$35.00 [on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps amp;field-keywords=walking+dead+compendium)) Best bet is to go with the Compendiums, if you buy both, you'll have up to issue 96, the Trade Paperback Volume 17 with issues 97-102 came out in early December. That gets you to issue #102, you can then buy the single issue comics for around ~$3-$7 a piece on eBay to get caught up to issue #107, or if you're lucky, you might find them at your local comic store for slightly less. Usually the comics are no longer cover price after a couple of months. You can also buy the comics digitally on Comixology for about $2.00 I believe. Hope this helps, and if I'm missing anything, please help add to this. Thanks!</TEXT>

    <DATE>2013-03-16 18:34:41</DATE>
    <TEXT>I know I would. I'd love to get the mods on board and am willing to help facilitate a good set of answers. I've messaged the mods in the past but I think if they can see a lot of subscribers jumping on board, it might push this to fruition. 1. I want to start reading the comics, but don't know where to start? 2. What's the best way to buy the comics? 3. Why doesn't the comic/show explore other states/cities/countries? 4. Why is there only one black guy allowed to be living at any given time? 5. Why does infections actually kill people? 6. Why don't zombies starve/die/etc? So on...I'm sure you guys can come up with more, just wanted to throw a few up I see all the time here. If not, then that's fine, I just know I'm not the only one with this sentiment.</TEXT>

Part of the fun in doing this is to discuss how subjects and themes play out down the line and how effective the set up in these early episodes are. No links or promotions of pirated material! There will be a parent comment that those who want to ask for links to watch can respond to and wait for a fellow redditor to pm them. Make sure PM'd sources are safe. **Ways to Watch** - Netflix - Amazon Instant Video - iTunes - Retail/Digital Home Video Cable options that extend to DVR, On Demand, PPV, etc.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In case the mods haven't seen yet, http://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/1dd0xw/moderators_new_subreddit_feature_comment_scores/ Its a new feature that allows to hide the comment scores for X amount of minutes. This would completely change (for the better) the way jokes/memes shoot to the top of the discussion threads ruining any chance for discussion. Who knows, maybe it won't, then we know memes truly are the preferred method of discussion, but a piece of me feels that's only the case because of the comment scores. Its a great experiment if not for nothing. Please option this idea for those of us who crave good discussion after each episode. Thanks. Your favorite member, subject4379 ;)</TEXT>

    <DATE>2013-05-24 23:05:29</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hey everyone. So i feel like there must be more than 133 kidrobot fans on Reddit with 60m+ users. I've never really "advertised" this sub only because its so plain. Its ironic too since kidrobot is really at its core **art**. I feel like if this had an amazing design, I would feel more proud of it thus advertise it better and get lots more people in here for a good steady stream of content. Before hiring an outside mod, I wanted to ask you guys first, the fans. Do any of you have artistic/creative talents and are familiar with CSS? If so let me know if you'd be interested in redesigning this sub top to bottom. Even if you don't have CSS skills, if you can produce pictures for the side or a banner at the top I'm open to that. Let me know your suggestions or apply within! Thanks!</TEXT>

Seeing all the fireworks - mortars, cakes, bottle rockets, etc. Shopping for them was the pinnacle behind lighting them off. Then comes the night. All the neighbors gathered in the cul-de-sac, fireworks spread around. Lynyrd Skynyrd playing, parents drinking, kids running around, dam I miss that. Love every bit of it!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi all (and hopefully deimorz), I've been at this for almost a week now researching and asking multiple resources all without fail. It should be super simple for someone that knows the regex engine well. I want to remove a post if it has less than 4 question marks **anywhere** in the body of a post. I've almost got it, but it still doesn't work. Here's what I have so far type: submission title: "request" body: "(.*\\?+){0,4}" modifiers: body: [regex, full-text] action: remove It needs to be able to look for question marks anywhere in the post, with sometimes having the? As the very last character, and sometimes not. Here's examples of what it would need to match on: --- This is text. This is text? This is text! --- **Or the example below** --- This is text? --- So there you have it, gold if you can help get it working:) Thanks in advance!</TEXT>

    <DATE>2013-07-19 02:41:35</DATE>
    <TEXT>**Edit:** The whole "herp derp if you get denied you don't deserve one" is asinine and indicative of ignorance on how the (admittedly) screwed up credit scoring system works. Credit scoring isn't black and white. Just because you get denied by an algorithm that has set thresholds doesn't mean you don't deserve a line of credit. It just means you could be off by literally a few points and still very worthy and responsible. --- This isn't a myth. This isn't the regular customer service line. Its a special, relatively unknown group of reps who strictly deal with reconsidering your application. These phone numbers generally never appear on the company websites. I just tried it with Chase and I have a credit card that I was denied for in the mail as we speak. Now, before you go calling one of these numbers, please do a bit of research and Google best practices when calling these numbers. You will be speaking to someone who has total power and discretion - so **be nice to the rep on the phone**. Know what you're going to say and be prepared to answer the questions straight up that don't get asked on credit card applications. The above is key though to why this works. When you fill out an application, it pulls your credit report and the system auto approves/denies based on various factors. This is your chance to *explain why* you have those blemishes on your report. Be honest, tell them you were 20 and given a huge line of credit and weren't as financially responsible as you are now. Or whatever the reason was. Either way, as long as you don't have a completely horrible score, but are within arms reach, there is a very good chance they'll reconsider, and override the denial. Good luck! Oh, and this should only be leveraged if you just recently applied but were denied, no more than a couple weeks or so. **American Express** (866) 314-0237  #8211; Main Application Reconsideration Line **Bank Of America** (866) 458-8805  #8211; General Account and Reconsideration Line (877) 721-9405  #8211; Personal Application Status Line, dial option 3 (800) 481-8277  #8211; Business Application Status Line Online Application Status Check **Barclay #8217;s Credit Card** (888) 232-0780  #8211; General Card Services and Application Line, dial option 3 for application status (866) 408-4064  #8211; Credit Line Questions Online Application Status Check **Capital One** (800) 625-7866  #8211; Application Services Line **Chase** (888) 245-0625 - Application reconsideration line - direct to live rep **Citibank** (800) 695-5171  #8211; Personal Application Status and Reconsideration Line with live rep (800) 763-9795  #8211; General Personal Application Inquiries with live rep (800) 645-7240  #8211; Business Application Status and Reconsideration Line, dial option 3 then option 1 for application status Source: http://thepointsguy.com/2013/03/credit-card-application-reconsideration-line-phone-numbers/</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Going off the recent favorite clean singer post, I was thinking to myself an answer, but remembered how horrible be sounds live. Ill start, and I fully respect many may not agree with me, and that's cool! However, Jeremy McKinnon from A Day To Remember just seems to struggle - hard - at keeping his clean vocals up during live shows. Constantly asking the audience to "jump in and help" during the clean vocal parts. It saddens me. I understand how crushingly difficult it is to sing live but my favorite parts of songs are his clean vocals and it seems any video I watch he can barely get through those parts. I was trying to think of singers who can't scream well live but none are coming to my head off the bat.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2013-10-13 06:07:10</DATE>
    <TEXT>I don't use mobile apps, however a friend of mine who reddits quite frequently from an app on her tablet had a post removed because it didn't follow the rules, she was flabbergasted. I showed her the sidebar in AskReddit and she was completely ignorant to the fact there were rules she could not see, nor knew even existed. I feel like there's an entire population of posts I remove that break the rules and its from people who aren't *trying* to be a rule-breaker, but are merely in the dark about their existence. How do you combat this? A sticky is really the only thing a mobile app will present that we as mods have control over, correct? What are the alternatives to getting mobile users to be aware of sub's individual rules short of having development re-design their app?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm curious to know the reddit community's preference to AMAs here. I see too many threads where people argue about promotion, too many celebrity AMAs, etc. Yet I look at the new queue and see ordinary people doing AMAs about their occupation or unique experience and it has maybe 2 or 3 comments in it. Is it because the proof hasn't yet been provided? Just uninteresting? Or we're a bit hypocritical and deep down do *only* enjoy the celebrity AMAs? So what do you like in your AMA sandwich and what triggers you to engage in it? I'm not asking about celebrity/high-profile AMAs only, but overall what's your preference/favorite types.

    <TEXT>[45 minute private acoustic performance](http://www.imgur.com/ZjwTuSV.jpeg) with Story of the Year in a tiny room, up close and personal. They just bullshit with you, ask questions, request songs, etc. Very casual and laid back. On my stop there were only 8 other people in the room. It was super intimate and special. Along with that you get a shirt, laminate, posters, and signing/photo taking with them. Nothing was rushed, we were allowed to have full on conversations with all the bands during the signing. Again, not "rushed" like every other meet and greet I've been to. Definitely one of the greatest experiences of my life. Every band performed amazing and I'm now a new fan of Like Moths to Flames and I Am King. They killed it!</TEXT>

I haven't yet really scrolled down the new queue listening, but prefer tailored recommendations that you guys have been **spot on** with in the past. What I like: - Bear vs Shark - Finch - Small Brown Bike - Thursday - Saosin/Emarosa (this totally negates my usual not liking higher pitched voice/singing) - ADTR - Silverstein - A Lot Like Birds - Defeater What I'm not a *huge* fan of is higher pitched voices (e.g A Skylit Drive), they rock the shit outta the genre and i 100% respect them, just not my thing. So with all the new albums that have come out recently, what would you suggest I pickup (old or new)? **Edit** I'm listening to blessthefall. This, I like this. **Edit^2**: I'm **really** liking this now 6 songs in (Hollow Bodies).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>**EDIT: Its an issue for many people**. Whats the best way to contact them **and** can we all contact so they know its widespread? I'm not asking for technical support here, just if anyone is experiencing this as well. I subscribe to All Access, but if I type in a popular artist, no search results display. If I go to "Explore" it will load recommended playlists from other people or new albums being released, but when going inside them its blank with no data [like this](http://www.imgur.com/dqp20Df.png).</TEXT>

    <DATE>2013-11-29 19:09:46</DATE>
    <TEXT>So, hi everyone! Wanted to ask your guys opinion on something, as I'm having an EDM identity crisis. So for the past ~15 years I've identified myself as a trance fanatic. Everything trance is my go-to EDM enjoyment. However over the last year or so, I believe I'm beginning to grow very fondly of house. Yes, I'm a big fan of avicii, and most recently, stumbled on Kaskade's "Angel on my Shoulder". To me, its more like vocal trance, but I'm probably, technically, incorrect (and that's ok). My questions are, what sub-genre would that song in particular go under? And follow-up, what other artists/songs would you recommend in that genre that are similar to Angel on my Shoulder? Thanks in advance and glad to be here!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>***Official FAQ*** I want to start reading the comics, where do I start?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2013-12-06 02:14:31</DATE>
    <TEXT>**READ THIS TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE COMICS WORK** **"Where to start with the comics?"** Books? Volumes? Compendiums? What does it all mean?! -------------------------------------------------- The comic book was released by Image Comics in October 2003. New issues are released every month, and currently on #119. If you want to start, here's the breakdown and best method. - **Comic Book** = 1 issue (Prices vary, though cover price is $2.99, that's only for the current issue) - **Trade Paperback (volumes)** = 6 issues (~$14.99) - **Hardcover Book (books)** = 12 issues/2 Trade Paperbacks (~$20.00) [contains original comic covers] - **Compendium** = 48 issues/4 Books/8 Trade Paperbacks (~$35.00 [on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps amp;field-keywords=walking+dead+compendium)) --- **Starting from the beginning?** Best bet is to buy the two the Compendiums, if you buy both, you'll have up to issue 96 **Just read both compendiums, now what?** Pickup Volumes 17, 18,  amp; 19 which will get you up to issue #114. From there buy issues #115-119 individually. You can also buy the comics digitally on Comixology for about $2.00 I believe. Hope this helps, and if I'm missing anything, please help add to this. Thanks!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>**DIFFICULTY:** People who are **up to date**, not only up to the end of the two compendiums or latest TPB (sorry, I know that cuts out a majority of you). I've read up to #115 and was just wondering how things have been progressing since then? I plan on going to the comic store today to pickup the latest issues sincei left off, but was hoping for a high-level 'vibe' on if you're enjoying it, or if its been just plain dull the last few issues?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>The utter downfall of /r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2014-02-12 04:50:05</DATE>
    <TEXT>I unsubscribed about a year ago - that was when it took a very fast, sharp turn from witty comics to "here's what happen in middle school today". There was no more wit, and there was a rapid decline in general humor too. Sorry, but humor from 11-14 year olds isn't the same level of humor generally exhibited everywhere else on reddit from highly upvoted *funny* comments or posts. This was clearly becoming very apparent by a large majority of subscribers. I just went back there after about 10 months and noticed they have less than 600k subscribers. Now I don't remember what it had before, but I know it was ~1 million. Their traffic stats are private. However I think this has to be the biggest downfall of a large subreddit in recent time, if ever? /r/atheism had a falling out, but that was due to rule changes and bad staff, this just seems to be due to a very obvious decline in quality of material. What's your personal take on the situation?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>seriously, if you were thinking about selling issue number 53, it will be at its highest price over the next 72 hours. Sell it on eBay with a Buy It Now option and you will get more for it now then any other time in the near future. Because after the hype settles down it will go right back down to its average price. However right now it's selling for nearly double on eBay as we speak.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Serious question for all of you in regards to the PRO version...</TITLE>
    <DATE>2014-02-19 07:17:44</DATE>
    <TEXT>Do you guys think its *fair* that you have to pay to create posts? Creating posts is one of, if not **the** most fundamental functionality on reddit. Android has numerous different reddit apps, most of which are just as elegant/feature-rich as AB, but none of them have the audacity to *charge* to create a post. I find this mind-blowing quite frankly. Common "pro" features on android versions are no ads (the obvious one), theme selections, mod tools, flairing, etc. What's really sad, is many people message us (I mod a few defaults) who have no idea that being able to create a post on reddit is completely free otherwise outside the app (and believe you me - I make sure to tell them as such). I'm not sure how the developer came to this decision, but its somewhat shady IMO. I have other gripes about it which ill email the dev directly about (such as the ever-popular "I submitted a post but it doesn't show up" complaint we get in modmail **every single day** which almost never is due to it being caught in spam folder), but wanted to have a genuine discussion about the post-creation functionality.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Rick's fate - how it will go down in both the comic and show?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2014-02-22 23:30:10</DATE>
    <TEXT>So. Kirkman has made statements in interviews (see below for source) after completing the series on paper, that Rick doesn't last until the end (in re: the comic). I'm actually ok with this and can't wait to see Carl go through that, and overcome the emotions to transition into being a leader. With that said I have two questions for you guys: * **Will this even happen in the show? Or do you think AMC (who owns the rights) will not let this happen?** * **When exactly will this happen (how far from the end), the very last issue/episode or x episodes/isuues out?** Personally I ~~think~~ hope it will happen in the show during the final season's mid-season finale. This gives Rick the longest run possible while still allowing a solid half-season showing their dynamic without him and close enough to the end so people who would stop watching will hold on till the end. It also allows for a gigantic event for that mid-season finale. As far as the comics go, I'm thinking they'll do it much farther out from the end, perhaps 15-30 issues out from the final issue which gives a solid 1-2 years without him. --- **MAJOR COMIC SPOILERS IN THIS ARTICLE** http://dailydead.com/exclusive-robert-kirkman-talks-issue-100-and-the-future-of-the-walking-dead/ If you don't want to read the whole thing, it's answered under the 3rd question, here's the excerpt:  gt; I definitely think that Rick has been the anchor for the series and may be the anchor of the series for a long time. I do have plans for him and I know where his story is going, but I **promise** that Rick **will not survive the entire run of the book**.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sorta on the same lines as the swat member zombies in riot gear, but a crazy big/tall/bodybuilder zombie? I never even thought of that situation but think it would make for great action on both the show and comic. **EDIT: I think I completely described my thoughts incorrectly.** **I'm not talking about a supernatural type boss zombie, but rather one who was just a very large human being to begin with, like The Rock, who has too decayed, but is still much larger than your typical walker, therefore harder to get a good headshot on with hand to hand combat.** This is no different than the swat member walkers whom took more than one "strike" to kill (and was entertaining). Just another way of showcasing a harder-than-normal to kill walker.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2014-03-24 02:47:59</DATE>
    <TEXT>I mean, its such an easy thing to do, the flag that identifies a subreddit as being self-post only is right there in the subreddit json file. Such a simple change that could drastically improve user experience. I don't have AB, but apparently its **very easy** to mistakenly use the "link" option when submitting a post, which if done in a self-text only sub (like AskReddit) the post doesn't make it obviously. This causes a **lot** of people wondering why their post was "sent to spam" or "removed by the mods". Hell, its even in the [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/AlienBlue/wiki/troubleshooting#wiki_my_posts_are_not_showing_up_in_the_subreddit_after_i_submit_them.) but my biggest gripe with this is that 9 times out of 10, the post wasn't filtered or removed at all, but rather they submitted it wrong. So rather than alerting the user "hey, this is a self-post only sub", you basically tell them to message the mods instead. Awesome. The amount of messages we get **daily** asking why their posts don't show up is starting to become a nuisance, and I'm just going to start recommending they find another app to use. I've started replying to people who message us about not seeing a post with "let me guess, you're using AlienBlue"? Almost every single time its "yes". Every top app available in android has this alert by default so its never an issue for android users. The worse part is the people coming to us saying "I finally paid for it so I can make a post yet you're blocking me why??" And we calmly tell them that its free to post everywhere else, only AB charges you to post. They usually flip out and take it out on us. As a moderator of large subreddits this app is causing us more stress than it should, and id love for the dev to take a step back, and really try to focus on making the user experience less dependent on blaming the mods/spam filters and utilizing alerts to make issues the user is having less ambiguous. The cherry on the top would be to allow creating posts in the free version, and having other bonus features in the paid version such as moderator functions, flair, etc.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Help with google script that displays unread email count on a dashboard I'm putting together. Not sure how to actually display the unread count (that comes from a function) on the webpage.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2014-03-31 01:11:46</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hey guys, I've been at this for probably 4 hours now and I'm sure it's something super freaking simple that I'm missing, but I'm a novice when it comes to JS. So I have a function to get the number of unread email count in my .gs script file, and in the index.html file (which is my dashboard page with a few different things on there), I'm having trouble just having it actually print out the "you have x unread messages" where x is being returned by the function. I don't know if I need to put the function in the index file as well, or what. I'm currently calling another function on the index.html page from the same .gs code that executes something on my calendar via a button (onclick), and that works fine. But with this, I'm just stumped and have no idea if I need to do a document.write or use a variable created on the index page and call that, or if I need to put the entire function from the .gs file in this index file, etc etc. Any help is SUPER appreciated. Here's what I have: Code.gs file: function getUnreadEmails() { var counter = GmailApp.getInboxUnreadCount(); counter = "You have "+counter+" unread emails" // Output the result in plain text format return ContentService.createTextOutput(counter) .setMimeType(ContentService.MimeType.TEXT); } I'm not sure how to actually get that to show up in my index.html file which is something like this so far: 
    script type="text/javascript"var unreadMail = "google.script.run.getUnreadEmails();"/script
    div class="title"
      h1My 
      spanamazing/span/h1
      pdashboard./p
    /div
    div class="title"
      p
        script type="text/javascript"unreadMail/script
      /p
    /divCurrently it just displays a blank area (no error or anything). Now before this current setup I have and showing you, I was doing it differently with no success. Where In my .gs file I just had: function getUnreadEmails() { return GmailApp.getInboxUnreadCount(); } and in the index.html page I was trying to call the function between the text like: 
    pYou have 
    script"google.script.run.getUnreadEmails();"/scriptunread emails/pbut that wasn't working either. Any help is so appreciated, thanks in advance!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>A plea to the AlienBlue developer from mods of text-based subreddits...</TITLE>
    <DATE>2014-05-03 06:55:30</DATE>
    <TEXT>Please, in your next udpate, leverage the API response for when a **link** is attempting to be submitted in a self-post based subreddit (e.g. /r/AskReddit which only allows self-posts). The sheer number of messages we get *daily* from users asking us to "remove their post from the spam filter" (sometimes very angrily) ([which your FAQ suggests they do](http://www.reddit.com/r/AlienBlue/wiki/troubleshooting#wiki_my_posts_are_not_showing_up_in_the_subreddit_after_i_submit_them.)) when after some probing, turns out the user is using AlienBlue and not submitting properly is astounding, and frankly becoming a nuissance. In fact, we're to the point now when someone asks us to "stop censoring them" or "approve their post" and we look and see there's nothing in their history, we **immediately** ask them if they're using AB and it's almost 100% of the time, "yes". Yes, you suggest they check their history to see if the post exists, but judging by the number of complaints we get regularly, people aren't heeding this advice. This leads to my plea - please, please, please employ the API's functionality of simply passing an alert to the user at the time of submitting that they're trying to submit a link in a self-post sub only. [Here's an example from an Android app that does this](http://imgur.com/vdCvs7x) though every Android app has some form of this alert as well, I just happen to prefer Reddit is Fun so used that as an example. Thanks.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2014-05-03 21:20:53</DATE>
    <TEXT>From the link: ##READ THIS TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE COMICS WORK --- ###"Where to start with the comics?" ####"Books? Volumes? Compendiums? What does it all mean?!" -------------------------------------------------- The comic book was released by Image Comics in October 2003. New issues are released every month, and **currently on #126**. If you want to start, here's the breakdown and best method. - **Comic Book** = 1 issue (Prices vary, though cover price is $2.99, that's only for the current issue) - **Trade Paperback (volumes)** = 6 issues (~$14.99) - **Hardcover Book (books)** = 12 issues/2 Trade Paperbacks (~$20.00) [contains original comic covers] - **Compendium** = 48 issues/4 Books/8 Trade Paperbacks (~$35.00 [on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps amp;field-keywords=walking+dead+compendium)). The 3rd compendium will be released sometime in mid-2016. --- ###Starting from the beginning? Best bet is to buy the two Compendiums, if you buy both, you'll have up to issue 96. This is the **easiest and least expensive** way to get the most issues for the least amount of money. Move to the next section to see how to get completely caught up. ###Just read both compendiums, now what? **Option A:** Pickup Volumes 17, 18, 19 and 20 which will get you up to issue #120. From there buy issues #121-126 individually. The 3rd compendium is due out in mid-2016. **Option B:** Pickup Book 9, Volumes 19 and 20 which also get you up to issue #120. From there buy issues #121-126 individually. **Option C:** You can also buy the comics digitally on Comixology and the Google Play store for about $2.00.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'd like to see more physical comic book content on this subreddit (aside from the actual storyline). It's the reason we're all here! It's a vast series with over 200 different individual issues (including all the variant covers and alternate guides/storylines) of which some are rarer than others. Yet the only thing (aside from discussion of storyline) I ever really see is people's purchase of the compendium. We never see pictures of people's *comic book* collection or items from it, so I'm wondering if any of the 164k people subscribed here actually collect them? I'd love to talk about acquiring them, different methods of doing that, favorite sellers, etc.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Seriously, google wallet's tap to pay feature that uses NFC is something I've been waiting for since I got this phone in December. Then, I see mentions of this new update coming out that "updates the knock on code". My knock on has been working just fine, so I just dismissed this whenever i saw it mentioned. Then I learned from someone on here in a completely off-topic comment that this upate actually activates the tap-to-pay feature in Google Wallet for T-Mobile (and other carriers that use Isis). I was stoked. Installed it, tested it, it works! Seriously, they should have named the update after that, as that's probably a feature that's wanted more than anything else.</TEXT>

It's extremely helpful, **and saves lives.** ---- The Bystander Effect in summary, is when there is a large amount of people, and therefore everyone assumes someone else is calling for rescue, when in fact no one has because there are so many people around "someone else will". Firefighter buddies of mime have told me stories of them getting to a scene with tens of people standing around for minutes while nobody has yet called for help, simply cause you automatically assume since there is so many people around someone already had to have done that. If you physically designate someone to call, they will. This tip can save a life. Other good supplemental tips to this others are pointing out. - Say please - Also tell them to confirm rescue is on the way to ensure they have called</TEXT>

    <TEXT>With the unfortunate news of Robin Williams passing away today, this has sent a surge through reddit's community, and people want to talk about it in one big space. What would you like to say about Robin Williams? Use this post share your thoughts. We also suggest you go back and see his AMA he [did 10 months ago, check it out here](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n41x1/robin_williams_its_time_for_a_convoluted_stream/). Note that comments are closed as it's an archived thread, but it's still a great read, and should give you some good laughs. --- As his death is an apparent suicide, we also wanted share some suicide prevention resources: National Suicide Prevention Lifeline: **1-800-273-TALK (8255)** /r/SWResources [The Alliance of Hope for Suicide Survivors](http://www.allianceofhope.org/) [Suicide Hotline phone numbers](http://www.reddit.com/r/SWResources/comments/17gu7g/hotline_numbers/) More Countries: [/u/bootyduty's list](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2dacie/robin_williams_megathread/cjnmf4d)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>REQUEST - Please develop functionality that when someone enters/posts to a subreddit for the first time, it takes them to the subreddit rules/sidebar page first. This would be a godsend for every mod on reddit.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2014-08-31 16:26:32</DATE>
    <TEXT>Seriously, the amount of people who get something removed/banned/whatever retort with "well im on AlienBlue and didn't know there were rules" is probably once a day. We've resorted to just telling people to message the dev or post here. But it's an excuse we see **all the time**, and we feel it could be quelled by doing *something* to make the subreddit sidebar in each sub they post in more accessible, or better yet, forced upon them at some point.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Tired of seeing unhelpful/joke answers filling up the threads? Make sure you use the 'report' button!</TITLE>
    <DATE>2014-09-03 04:58:23</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi all, lately we've grown in size considerably! This is definitely an awesome thing, however that also means more and more people who don't read the rules/have no regard for the rules are funneling in. Lately we've been getting more and more unhelpful answers clogging up the threads at break-neck speed - and we've also been getting more modmails from the community complaining about them - which reinforces just how important rule #2 really is and how well-received it is...however we notice that there's rarely *ever* stuff in the reported/mod queue. While we try our best to be on top of everything, it's impossible for our team to be inside every single thread at all times looking out. This is why the **report** button is so important. When you report something, it puts it in a special queue - a one-stop-shop for us where we see everything reported on one page. This makes it very easy for us to weed them out and remove everything in one fell swoop. So please, if you see an unhelpful or joking response, **please hit the report button** under that comment. Also, if the report is of urgent nature (hidden NSFW links, etc) please feel free to message us as well. Thanks for everything you guys do and all the crazy wacky things y'all identify! --- **TL;DR: Use the report button and downvote any comment that's an unhelpful/joke answer so we can get them taken care of asap!**</TEXT>

    <DATE>2014-09-23 18:42:43</DATE>
    <TEXT>We're proud to announce that today we are unveiling our new subreddit design! We have been coming up with ideas for our new style and **/u/qtx** took the design further than we could have imagined. The new style includes a bunch of design enhancements throughout every crevice of the subreddit and post sections, lots of hovering techniques (seriously, hover over *everything*), and a filter to choose which posts you see (something we got a lot of requests for)! While we have been working recently to make sure the new style works as well as it looks, we do want to know if there are any bugs. If you find any, please reply here with a description of the issue, a screenshot, what device/browser you're using and whether or not you're using RES. We'd love to see what you guys think of the new style and please remember to visit /r/IdeasForAskreddit if you have ideas for rules, policies, and CSS ideas!</TEXT>

    <DATE>2014-10-22 22:20:53</DATE>
    <TEXT>**Edit: The post episode discussion usually gets posted within 1-3 minutes of the episode ending.** Also, to add to this PSA, if you post a joke/one-liner/pun or otherwise go off-topic, the comment will be removed as these threads are heavily moderated (by request). Any other posts after the episode airs that's asking questions about it, sharing thoughts, opinions, etc will also be removed as you now have two different discussion threads to post those in.

It combines our (secret) love of reddit, along with the best show on the planet! The color is dark/slate grey-ish/brown-ish type combo. Profits from the shirt goes towards a charity that reddit users will pick/vote on at the end of this year. If you haven't heard, [redditmade is a new crowdfunding-type system that let's users and subreddits create their own merchandise](https://redditmade.com/about-us). There's also a set of stickers available [here](https://redditmade.com/campaign/the-walking-dead-custom-stickers) which are of course going on someone's laptop or '98 Honda Civic. You get one of each, and shipping is $1. With the holidays approaching, this is a pretty cool gift and not something you'll find anywhere else. I'm getting three of them, **one of which will be given away here as a prize for a yet-to-be-determined contest we'll hold during the Holiday season.** Remember though, if we don't hit the campaign goal of 250, it won't get made, so let's make this happen cause this shirt deserves to see the light of day!</TEXT>

All subsequent posts about that topic will be removed and pointed to the appropriate wiki page/discussion post - no more fast food - we need more mods to help with the duplicate posts - no more duplicate posts (discussions, duplicate links/pictures have already been removed prior to this) - more moderation in the comments section in re: to spoilers - we definitely need more mods --- Hi all, I guess a feedback/suggestion thread is a long time comin'... We want to hear your ideas on how to make this place a bit better, along with your suggestions of *how to implement these ideas*. --- **[Please fill out this poll](http://goo.gl/forms/qOjDBGBF4E)**, but feel free to voice everything in the comments section as well. --- We get **tons** of feedback however it's nearly impossible to make every person happy with suggestions coming from both sides of the argument (more memes/less memes, spoilers allowed/spoilers not allowed, etc.). To get things going, we'll throw a few ideas out here up front that get lots of complaints from both sides of the fence... - Sunday night - Tuesday-ish...Should we remove any and all posts that have *any* mention of the events that took place in the most recent episode **in the title**? This doesn't only pertain to *major* spoilers/events (which are already banned from titles), but even the minor things (e.g. "Can't believe the bus flipped!", "I KNEW EUGENE WAS HIDING SOMETHING", etc). This would help with the vocal complaint re: spoilers in the titles. - Should we remove any mention of any minor event/character/etc. from the comic if in the title? People have complained that they already know who Negan is because of the numerous posts about him, same with the whole "tainted meat" situation. Should things like new character names (who haven't yet appeared in the show), events, and generic groups/plotlines be removed if it's in the title? Or should we leave them be since they're not *big* spoilers and this sub is very much about the comic as it is the show (so we shouldn't walk on eggshells for the people who haven't read the comic)? - What other types of discussions would you like to see during the week after the two big episode discussions have fizzled out/maxed out? - Image macros/memes...yes/no? - Define "shitposting" in your own words. - Reposts...should we no longer allow any of the questions that constantly get asked (do walkers poop, why doesn't Maggie care about Beth, etc.)? Note: We currently remove reposts of links but not discussions. That's all I could think of right now. Vent to us. Complain and let it out. We're here to change stuff up and hear what you guys want since the overall contention is that this place needs work. So tell us what *your* ideal /r/thewalkingdead would look like. Thanks!</TEXT>

    <DATE>2014-12-09 01:26:22</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi /r/techsupport! So, over the last 4ish days or so, I've noticed that roughly 50% of the time I go to load a page, it stalls. I end up hitting stop, reloading/refreshing, and it may or may not come up. Even running a speed test or downloading a file that takes longer than 10 seconds, it's almost sure to fail and just halt/stop in the middle. **Equipment used:** - Comcast Xfinity service - Arris TG862 modem/router combo (with coax cable going directly to wall) **TL;DR Troubleshooting steps I've done:** - Power cycled modem - Plugged directly in to ethernet - changed DNS manually - connected to another wifi and saw it works fine - Modem signal levels are good - verified nothing interfering with modem (no electronic devices near it) - checked modem logs and saw **very suspicious crap** happening with *constant * release/reconnection of DHCPv6 server?  lt;--- I think this is very much related to the problem, see screenshot below of log This is happening to both my tablet and phone as well using wifi. I also connected to my neighbors wifi with their permission, and it ran fine for the 2 hours I was on it, so it doesn't seem to be my computer/software on my end. I checked my modem signal levels and they seem to be fine, and fall well within the ranges of what's acceptable. I've power cycled the modem a few times, and also should note that the coax cable coming from my wall goes directly into the modem. Something that's strange though, is in the logs of the modem, shows constant disconnects/reconnects from the DHCPv6 server: [see image](http://i.imgur.com/39V9LyV.png) This is why I feel like it's gottta be something related to this problem, but googling doesn't give me much other than other forum posts where people have the same type of logs, but get no answers. I connected my laptop directly into the modem and surfed for about 10 minutes but saw the same thing was happening (although maybe it was just my mind going numb at that point or reddit being slow as it was crashing sporadially the last couple days, so that may not have been a true test honestly). I called Comcast (...I know...) and they confirmed that everything looks fine on their end. What's strange, is that if I run a continuous ping to google, after abotu 1000 pings it only seems to fail a couple of times, which doesn't align with the issues I'm experiencing at the time it's consistently pinging successfully. I also changed my DNS server at one point to google's (8.8.8.8/8.8.4.4) and still had the same issue. I'm at my breaking point, I don't know what else to do. Any troubleshooting suggestions I'm open to. I read somewhere perhaps changing my wifi channel might help. I'll be honest, I used to do tech support for a broadband company back in the early 2000's, and this used to be a troubleshooting step we would tell people to do that NEVER worked. Should I try this? Thanks in advance!</TEXT>

    <DATE>2014-12-23 21:19:24</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hey all! So I've read here and there on this sub about people "saving up" their battle chips, whereas for me, every time I hit that 2000 mark I go unlock an arena crystal (which I know will just be gold, and not a 3* punisher). I was wondering though, should I be saving them for something? Cause I don't mind doing that, since I'm over the whole opening an arena crystal at 2k chips at this point, so I'm totally open to just holding on to them if there's an actual benefit. Thanks!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So, I know this would be considered **super** cheap and dirty if playing against actual other people, but since it's AI, i don't feel so bad :P So yea, Deadpool's heavy attack is a roundhouse kick, and I guess because of the physics and the exact lenght that he bounces back, you can basically keep doing it over and over again until they die. It's not too hard to time either, once you pull it off, just immediately hold down your right finger for about 1 second and release, it will hit them every single time.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have a couple champions that I have and use solely as warm bodies for the 3v3 events. Namely Storm and Scarlet Witch. I'm not a sexist or anything but these have to be the two worst champs in the game. Everything about them angers me. From their weak "dashing" which only works about 20% of the time (usually it just throws a high kick when I try to dash) to the fact that their special attacks can be very easily blocked if executed at the end of a combo. I just hate them both and groan when they're the last two who still have stamina. /rant... That felt good. Does anyone else feel the same about them?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>LPT: To those of you who received the Compendiums for the holidays, here's a guide that will get you caught up after finishing them!</TITLE>
    <DATE>2014-12-28 05:33:04</DATE>
    <TEXT>So, the comic book is currently on issue #135 (and are released monthly). The compendiums contain 48 issues each, therefore if you've read and finished both, you're at issue #96...a whole 39 issues behind. Unfortunately the 3rd compendium won't be due until late 2015/early 2016. Who wants to wait that long!? Rather than buying issues #96-135 individually, here's the best and cheapest ways to get caught up via the Trade Paperbacks ("volumes") and hardcover books ("books"): **Option A:** [Pickup Trade Paperback Volumes 17 - 22](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Daps amp;field-keywords=the+walking+dead+volume+17) which will get you up to issue #132. From there buy issues #132-135 individually which cost $2.99 each for physical copies (local comic store, eBay, other online retailer), and $1.99 digitally through Google Play or Comixology. **Option B:** Pickup Hardcover Books 9-10, Trade Paperback Volumes 21 and 22 which also get you up to issue #132. From there buy issues #132-135 individually. **Option C:** You can also buy the comics digitally on Comixology for about $2.00. The trade paperbacks and hardcover books can be purchased through Amazon (which I linked up above) or your local comic book store most likely.

    <TEXT>I got 100% on the Easy and 52% on the medium, got my catalysts, then never went back into it for the last 3 weeks. I just realized yesterday that you can in fact still get catalyst drops after completing the event for the first time. This blew my mind and felt stupid at the same time. I think this is crucial for the tier 1 basic gray catalyst which seeminly is the hardest one for me to get. I've got catalysts (both tier 1  amp; 2) of all colors, but could never get the basic tier 1 gray catalyst. This event will drop it most likely once a day it seems.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So I thought about it for a couple hours...the last 3 events I entered - both Thor 2  amp;3/4* arenas, and Majik - and I came out short all 5 times (I didn't compete in Captain Marvel or Storm cause I wasn't interested in them). I grinded these events hard, granted I slept for 8 hours each night, but mostly throughout the day I was playing near every 2-3 hours. I had 7 teams of 2* champs and 4 teams of 3* champs, and regularly got my streak up to 11-14x. I'm also not a stranger to skill and the tricks of the trade, helping me to [win events like this](https://s3.amazonaws.com/pushbullet-uploads/ujyvPBGyaAu-d7kEDKfB58KMHojSeE2AK5FTaXe8byw6/Screenshot_2015-02-06-20-15-55.png). What I'm trying to convey is, I'm not one of the numerous new players who's complaining about not getting anything only having 1-2 teams and no understanding of how the mechanics of the fighting works. Anyway, I dedicated a week of my life for a premium crystal with lots of teams and good gameplay, and all I got to show for it was 4 premium crystals which netted 4 2* duplicates. It's honestly insulting. The thing is, is that I'm no stranger to winning to events. I ranked high enough to get Rhino, Captain America, Iron Man, and the first Crystal Cornucopia that netted me the top prize in those events respectively. However, and this is **key**, I'm also one of those players who's a little above "casual", has been playing since December, and has yet to get a 4* champ. I sit by watching all my friends, co-workers, and other people in various forums/social media fly by with 3/4/5+ 4* champs and I'm just here left in the dust. This wasn't such a big problem back in the events I won because there was far less people with 4* champs. It's very easy to see and transparent that the threshold for ranking is going up and up each event with the new players combined with new/existing players getting 4* champs. I wasn't so bothered by not getting a 4* champ since my logic was that Alpha catalysts are so rare, that barely anyone has ranked their 4* past 3/5, and at that level, a 4* champ is the same PI roughly as a fully maxed out 3* , so I wasn't really missing much, and let the whole "not getting any 4* champs" complaint finally go a few weeks ago. But then I realized just how wildly different the arenas are playing with 4* champs, and the sheer number of points received each match compared to that of a 3*. This is when I realized I literally have no hope at all unless I wake up every 2 hours and spend tons of money on units to recharge as well. That's why this time around I said fuck it - when I saw them do this for Storm I thought "lool who the fuck would pay to play to win her??!", but, I already had 180 units, so I bought the 275x pack for $9.99 which got me into the event with 55 units left over (each match costs 5 units). I then spent another $4.99 for 135 units which will keep me playing until the end, so I feel for $15 the chances being much higher that I'll get both a 3* (milestone reward at 600k) and the 4* was worth it to me. Hell, I spent way more opening up stupid premium crystals over the last 2 months anyway, so I feel this wasn't as crazy as a decision as I first though it would be. **TL;DR: I've played every single day since 12/12 when it came out, left with shit for shambles. I had enough, and decided $15 is a small price to pay for getting a champ I really want, and not having to hate life for 7 days straight.**</TEXT>

    <DATE>2015-02-13 16:23:19</DATE>
    <TEXT>He's AWESOME!! First and foremost, I'm REALLY happy that they finally put out a really good "new" champion, since the last two (Majik and Captain Marvel) were somewhat lackluster. In fact, nobody I talk to in the groups I lurk use them on their main roster, they just don't have anything with a "wow" factor. Electro - he's a beast offensive wise, so to those of you who are offensive players, you're going to love him. He hits HARD like Iron Fist, and his L1/L2 specials take out almost double the damage every other champ at his same level/rank put out on those hits. His L3 special deals a Stun that lasts longer than any stun I've seen in the game. It gives me enough time to do a 5-hit combo, heavy attack, and another 5-hit combo. Lastly, his passive ability is "Static Shock" which basically deals the opponent damage every time they so much as touch you. He's awesome, he's definitely being ranked up as we speak to sit on my main roster replacing Captain America as my Science guy. Good luck everyone!! PS: [Here's his PI/stats at rank 2/4 level 20/20](https://s3.amazonaws.com/pushbullet-uploads/ujyvPBGyaAu-Q2j8rbINnBRv4s2J6ievIPLCCl3RIvAb/Screenshot_2015-02-13-10-26-02.png), and [here's his abilties](https://s3.amazonaws.com/pushbullet-uploads/ujyvPBGyaAu-lxogBRErZEnEX5WetOkOPGQ00K1TMZRS/Screenshot_2015-02-13-10-27-00.png). Again, even though the stun is average on the L1/L2, the damage they take away is beyond what I've seen with champs at that same level.</TEXT>

And the stun after his L3? Pffttt...forget about it. I was able to execute the standard 5-hit, then a heavy attack, then **another** hit which resulted in another 5-hit combo. He's awesome with the exception of his very low health, however if you're offensive and rarely block/plan on getting hit, he's great.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2015-03-15 02:54:09</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm genuinely curious - granted right now, rating has zero affect (directly, but there is an indirect benefit to having someone with a higher rating on your alliance which I'll get to after), however it's been said by the game team that alliance rating will have a huge benefit/factoring into the base feature and how other new awards are dished out. This is why people want a high alliance rating. There's nothing wrong with that. As far as the indirect benefit right now, the higher the players rating, the more active they are. Granted, someone with a lower rating can be just as active, but someone with a higher rating is making it obvious they're active, and thus you can rely on that more. I see all the time people in here or the in-game chat talking about wanting in another alliance cause their current one nobody asks for help or responds to help requests, and I look at the alliance and it's always the same story - a really low team rating. The two have a direct connection with each other - low rating = casual player = no help responding. I dunno...the game is a competition, people want to be the best. Part of that means having the "highest" alliance rating. It's like anything else in this world that's a competition. This is nothing different. I know I'll get some angry people but I wanted to shed some light on the other side of the coin to those who are curious (which I see people saying all the time) and to find out why people are so against this right now. Cheers and game on!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So, I'm fighting a 4* Superior Iron Man, about 600 PI above mine (just to give context). My Dr. is 3* rank 4/4 level 32/40, awakened. Superior Iron Man executes his L3 special on me, I was about 60% health at this point, and as he starts blasting his beam at me, my life **shot up** instead of down. I wasn't paying attention to my power meter when he executed it, but when it was done, I was about half of the 2nd one filled up, so not sure where it was though before that. And I mention that, because I know that once his L2 power meter fills up, he gains life from every hit he makes against the opponent, but I wasn't hitting anything, I was getting blasted by a power beam, and my life went all the way up to full health. Could this be it? Perhaps could you guys test it out by getting an opponent to use his L3 and see if it raises your health instead of takes away and we see if this is what it does if multiple people confirm?</TEXT>

Along with a few others we've had in there, and sorry about those inundating the sub. Everything on there was stolen/rehashed anyway as others pointed out.

    <TITLE>[Modpost] Alright folks, let's talk about a new official thread for TSDF/SDF spoilers, new rules about titles, and reminder of the spoiler policy.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2015-10-25 23:05:49</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hey everyone, so lately there's been lots of anger (rightfully so) over spoilers littering the sub by way of badly-worded titles or comments in general. First things first, spoilers in titles are never allowed, and **will result in a ban** without warning. Titles like "I can't believe subject4379 died!!??", whether it just happened in an episode, or a future event, will be removed and you'll be banned. It's a dick thing to do, so it's deserved punishment. *This also applies to comments which are not properly tagged/masked, which we have instructions on how to do in the sidebar.* Also, please never hesitate to **report** comments/posts that you see in the wild that break the spoiler rule. Those help us tremendously. Next, **which is a new policy**, is many times a title which doesn't exactly have a spoiler directly in it, still ruins things for people not reading the comic by way of having *names of characters* who haven't yet been introduced to the show but are long-standing in the comic. Titles like (names changed for obvious reason): "How do you guys think subject4379 will be introduced in the show??" or "If they don't cast Henry Rollins as subject4379 I'll stop watching". While somewhat harmless, you're still letting people know that a character named subject4379 will be included, and that's still spoiling stuff whether you agree or not, and it's not fair to the non-comic readers. You can still make posts like that, just leave the names out of the titles - this isn't hard to do and makes everyone happy. Moving forward, any title with a character's name in it (that hasn't yet been introduced to the TV show) will be automatically removed. **Lastly**, we know that many people enjoy talking about/sharing spoilers from sites like Spoiling Dead Fans, so we're going to create an official discussion/Q amp;A thread which will be linked at the top of the subreddit (not a sticky, but just above those) for all of you to go wild in. Therefore, **any post created that would have the [Future Spoilers] tag or any SDF content/questions about spoilers in it will be removed** and the user directed to the official discussion thread (as not to clutter up the sub with these posts). We haven't yet thought of a particular format for this post (having a link to the website, all info in the text box initially, or just let people comment the links/material on their own, etc.) but any suggestions from you guys is welcome. If there's anything else you guys can think of that we missed, feel free to share here so we can enact on that as well, so we can try our best to satisfy the majority of you. With just under 1/4 million people here, it's really hard to keep everyone happy, but we're doing our best to try, thanks everyone for reading! **P.S.** - We're going to be bringing on more mods, so if interested lookout for an official mod recruiting post in the next few days or so.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Which champs do you guys agree that their L1/L2's almost never work directly after a combo, and vice versa?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2015-10-26 17:29:37</DATE>
    <TEXT>For instance, It's almost a guarantee that when using Iron Man, after a 5-hit combo, his L1 or L2 will **never** stick, and the opponent will always block it. Therefore I've learned to just save up to his L3. Same goes for Iron Fist I've noticed (wihch is a shame cause he's one of the most power offensive champs in the game - by far). Other champs I've noticed where it almost always **does** land is Colossus's L1, and Captain America's L1. Who else is out there where it's just a waste of time trying to hit is L1/L2 after a combo? This is a good chance to get people to not waste their time with L1/L2 and save up for their L3. Personally I'd love to know more to better help wtih my rounds. Thanks!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I researched a ton of threads in here before settling down with Strava - which let's be honest - garners the biggest CJ on this sub by long shot. However I noticed that it just gets really wonky with the GPS, and the actual line it leaves is terribly off many times. I've read others having this issue, but is it more widespread? Do most of you experience this as well? I feel like that's a huge disadvantage to this app, and tried MapMyRide which I feel beats Strava in almost every aspect and wonder why it's not hailed more on this sub. I guess I'm wondering what the *disadvantages* are to MMR since it doesn't get nearly the amount of love that Strava does.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Attacks you can actually dodge without blocking, but might not be aware of.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2015-11-09 19:20:11</DATE>
    <TEXT>So, there's a few special attacks out there that some champs have, that *seem like* they are long range in which you have to just block it, but in reality can be dodged by swiping back either once or twice. The ones I know of are: - Spiderman's L2 (where he jumps and swings on his web). This looks like he'll swing all the way across the screen, but in reality it just swings a tad and he flings back. Once swipe back and he'll miss you entirely - Thor's L1. Again, this one looks like it can reach across the screen, but one or two swipes back and it won't even touch you, sparing you some hit points if you had blocked it Again, it took me a while to learn that you can in fact swipe back and dodge them without blocking. This is critical with Spderman's L2 simply cause even when you block that, it takes out a ton of damage. Are there any others that are deceiving like this, and can in fact be dodged with swiping back other than the ones I mentioned? Hope this helps some of you!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So, I've run through all the paths except for one on the very last act/chapter/stage, and am currently going through the last path to 100% it. I've already run through this same stage 5 times or however many it is, with relative/moderate difficulty (which is to be expected). Nothing too crazy. However, I'm in the middle of running the last path I decided to leave open, and it's like night and day to me compared to the other 5 times I ran it via different paths in the stage. Champs that are significantly weaker than mine are wooping my ass. They're much much faster and blocking everything, and overall I can absolutely see and feel a change to the overall difficulty. Shit, I'm having issues with an 1800 PI Hawkeye (all my champs are 4* 3/30). Something's up. Has anyone else noticed this?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Does anyone know why this is, and/or if they will be available at some point? I went to buy a level 3 or 4 potion just now and realized the only thing they have for sale is the level 2 for single champs, non alliance potions. Do they have some sort of schedule of when they make these available for purchase? It doesn't make any sense to me why you can't buy them...? I know they exist since I bought a ton during the sale that just ended.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have a 3* Superior Iron Man I got from the first arena that he got introduced to the game, sitting at rank 2/4 waiting to be ranked up since I got him that week. It's probably been about 10-11 months now or so? He's been sitting there so long I gloss over him and forgot about him a while back. I have no plans to rank him up either at this point, nor have I ever just cause I never saw anything about him I cared for, and always had another champ to rank over him. So, 10-11 months (whenever SIM came out - had to be around Jan/Feb?) collecting dust. Anyone else have one that long?</TEXT>

    <DATE>2016-03-30 22:48:16</DATE>
    <TEXT>So through the last few weeks, I've read through many threads talking about AW exploration and seeing a majority of people talking about never 100%ing it, or even coming close. I'm curious why this is (assuming you're getting matched up *somewhat* fairly with another alliance that's somewhat equal to your rating)? There's 9 paths in total, plus 10 champs who can participate. What's the problem? Is there anything we as a community can help you guys with (I mean this genuinely)? I know I'm coming off very douchey, I don't mean to, I just want to understand why so many teams aren't able to get the 100% exploration (which led to a lot of complaints with the updated exploration requirements) and wondering if you guys are getting unfairly matched against alliances that are 2m+ greater than yours or something else I'm missing? I know it's a difficult thing to do, but the sheer number of people I've seen mention not being able to do it has me wondering if what my alliance is doing is completely unheard of or what? Granted we work our asses off to do so, but it's just communication in the end that aids in the completion (well, and skill).</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Rant on the "CHASE" sticker on the pops.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-04-09 16:58:36</DATE>
    <TEXT>So, we all love chase pops of course. That's the nature of collecting for any hobby. However, as someone who's been in the vinyl toy collecting scene for over 10 years now, it's very odd to me that they display CHASE so prominently and flashy on the boxes. No other vinyl toy does this (that I know of). I don't like that - I feel as though it "cheapens" the experience. It's like they're advertising "here's the secret character!". Maybe it's different for blind boxes (which is where my roots started), but a chase figure, you didn't know it was a chase by the internals, it was always just a "???" with a silouhette on the box for the image. It never advertised itself as a chase, you just knew because it wasn't one of the regular characters for that series shown on all the display casing - And when you found one/opened one, it was an exhilierating experience. Having a chase was much more "exclusive" feeling cause there was no advertised image of it. I dunno, I can't explain it I guess, but CHASE plastered on the box doesn't make it fun for me at all. Finding a chase pop out in the wild without the CHASE sticker to me would make the experience of finding it so much cooler. But anyone who walks by one can see that it's a chase and snatch it up for their nephew, not knowing it was rare had that sticker not been there cause they don't know of the goings-on in the scene. It's like a hidden treasure chest having a huge sign on it saying "IM A TREASURE CHEST". It's a very *commercialized* feel to it, again, don't like that. I'm not ranting on the fact that other people can get one from me, I don't go for chases much anyway, it's just the overall sentiments on how they proudly display the chase factor on the box. It's like gloating. Was wondering if I'm the only one out of the 15k people here who felt this way...</TEXT>

However it's obviously Android-update related, and was wondering if anyone also experienced this and was able to fix it. I did a search on here and the forums but anyone else describing the issue had different situations (like they came to a new device that didn't have the horsepower to begin with) or are on iOS.

    <TITLE>PSA: Just because you come across someone that does something challenging, doesn't mean they're cheating. If you suspect cheating, report it to Kabam, don't shame them on here especially if you have no proof.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-07-02 19:27:24</DATE>
    <TEXT>**Edit:** Guys, I know cheating exists, I'm not saying it doesn't. But just because someone does something that's perhaps many levels above your skill level at the time, doesn't make it physically impossible. If someone beats a maxed out AW boss with health buffs with a 2* in one fight, then yea, that's a pretty good indicator it's cheating since that's physically impossible without getting a timeout. --- Seriously, this shit is getting annoying. So many middle-of-the-road players on here instantly scream "cheater" because someone beats an AW boss with both nodes (even funnier when it's not even Expert map), or completes RoL without using the common methods. Yes, there's people out there that are very good at the game and can win fights that you can't. Stop the witchhunts. Instead use that time to acquaint yourself with all the different champs and their abilities and hone your skills - become a well-rounded player - which means being able to take on opponents with any champs you have at your disposal, or using unorthodox/creative methods to win. Read the character descriptions carefully, there's probably a lot of stuff you're missing because you're relying on the "popular" methods that everyone promotes.</TEXT>

I'd love to show people how to effectively use them and the unorthodox methods that can be benefitted from them.

    <DATE>2016-07-23 18:34:19</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm in my early 30's, grew up on the 90's X-men Saturday morning cartoon, and was an avid comic collector. Image was just coming with Spawn and as cool and different as Image was, my heart was always with Marvel. I inherited my Uncles collection which included amazing artifacts from the 60's-80's, including key issues and what not. I loved Marvel and was a huge impact on my life as a kid. Around high school it all sorta fell off and I didn't really know anything about the Universe except for the movies that were coming out in the 2000's. We're now in a huge Marvel revival and I'm loving it - but what's even better is this game is keeping me connected to all the characters and relationships so when all these movies and shows are coming out, I'm *excited* about them because I have a vested interest in the characters again. I'm psyched for Iron Fist, and none of my friends have any clue what that is. I'm excited to see him play out on the screen and get to see his background since he was my favorite character when the game came out. Anyway, that's my thoughts. And full disclosure, I'm in the minority whereas I'm happy with the changes coming. People were relying *way too much* on BP teams.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2016-08-02 02:01:17</DATE>
    <TEXT>Everyone is complaining how nobody can afford to do it each week - that's the point they're blatantly making in the official forums - is that they don't **expect** any team to do it each week. This now gives your alliance the "choice" to pick which week you're going to spend a fuckton of gold/chips/loyalty, and fight your asses off that week and hope that only a handful of alliances went in that week who were able to do better than you. Plus, they keep repeating themselves about how *good* the crystals and milestone rewards are going to be now, maybe we start getting T4CCs way more often now? If that's the case, I'm ok with that while doing map 3 every week. We don't know what's to come of this, let's play it out and see how it ends up. Maybe they are upping the T4CC drop rate by a ton? It was said "we've made this next AQ season completely scalable", which means they're thinking for the long-term while we're all in short-sightedness mode. I truly feel like they're changing the tide manually to make T4CCs the new T4BC, sort of like how the Alpha was once the current T4CC and now we have to sell them to keep stash happy. Anyway, that's my thoughts for the day on this whole thing. **TLDR:** I say bring it on and let's see if we get T4CCs more often now like Kabam has repeatedly said we would.</TEXT>

Folds/layers/etc are usually on the bottom of something since they are considered an eye sore. So I tried the crunchwrap *for the very first time* last night. Halfway through and everything was falling out from the bottom due to the folds limping down and what not. When I was done and mildly infuriated, I lookd at the picture in the sidebar and realized I was eating it wrong. Don't be like me.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2016-08-24 01:46:35</DATE>
    <TEXT>BTW I'm not talking about the nest changes last night, though I'm wondering if the following was also done...Also for context, I'm a level 20 who has a moderately healthy pokedex I guess. So I know this is anecdotal right now but that's why I'm asking. I've been playing for a month now, living in the same place, and taking the same route to and from work Mon-Fri. You get used to the pokemon you see in these everyday situations, with maybe an unseen popping up maybe once or twice a week or so. Today has been different though - on the way to work I had 3 unseen pokemon in a spot that never has anything surprising or unusual, then closer to work the same thing happen with 2 unseen showing up - all in my nearby list at the same time. On the way home from work I had a total of 4 unseen and 4 very uncommon pokemon (that I happen to have already) for my area show up at various points.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So I just saw a post where someone asked which to choose first of the 4 mons spawned in his screenshot, in there were a dratini, ghastly, oddish, and pikachu. Everyone was going nuts over the Oddish, and it never occurred to me that Oddish isn't like Pidgey/Rattata everywhere else, and that they're considered desirable to others. I had no idea. Here in South Florida where Water, Grass, and Bug types rule the kingdom, and have probably amassed over 500 oddish candy in the last 3 months without effort, I was wondering what the other "common" spawns in your area are that aren't common in other places.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2016-11-04 02:45:56</DATE>
    <TEXT>Now having more than one sub in beta that I mod, I wanted to view just the messages from one of the subs, so instinctively I clicked that subreddit, only to notice that it *removes* it from the enabled list. I get the concept of how it works, but when this is a GA release and we have 10+ subs in the filter list and we want to just view one sub, it's going to be much more easier to just click the sub we want to target rather than uncheck "all communities" and then check the sub we want to enable. I know this is a very "me me me" request, but I truly think I'll be speaking for lots of people with this idea. Then again maybe I'm doing it wrong entirely and for that I'll go sit in a corner.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Mine is Skill by a long shot. Cbones and some BW carried me through RtL minus the parts I was able to cheat my way through with SW. Karnak, cbones, BW, Falcon...Reducing ability accuracy is a cornerstone of the game now, and Karnak's True Strike buff is easily my new favorite buff in the game and will become more and more popular for sure in the next year. Nothing like steamrolling a stupid spiderman in AW in only 3 combos with no evade in sight. I just feel skill has some of the best Champs in the game currently.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>To all you Android users who are curious about just how long it actually takes to run a quest for Legends speedrun, here's what I found out yesterday and hope this helps others (and saves you the time)...</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-06-11 21:09:07</DATE>
    <TEXT>So, I've been wanting to do a speedrun since they were introduced last year. I've always known I'd have a legitimate shot at it due to me feeling pretty well versed in the game. Preface for context: I've been playing since the day it came out, can intercept without paying attention (it's about as subconcious as driving stick shift to me), know all the tricks (even the ones that are never mentioned on here), and can generally end fights very quickly. I'm only saying this because I just want to make it clear that I'm not some rando newb who thinks he has a shot but in reality has none at all - I can play the game well, complete end-game content quickly, yada yada. With that said, I've always wondered *just how much of a handicap* does Android really have. I know 100% it cannot be done, but it's been gnawing at me for months and months. Now with the latest update that caused Android devices to load much faster, I knew it was time to just try it, So I set aside the time yesterday morning to do a run and see how long it took just to 100% Heroic. I'm using an LG V10 which is pretty powerful, and R4 SL with mystic crit/attack team and had 30% attack boosts running the entire time. My SL's attack rating was 2700 and when class advantage was over 3k. Here's what happen: I started off doing a full run from start to finish (1.1 - 3.2) just to gauge what I'm looking at time wise. That took roughly 22 minutes I believe. I thought "hmm, that's actually not *that* bad, let's keep going". Every fight from 1.1-3.1 was finished in 1-5 hits (around 80% of them being 1-2 hits). The last two bosses took around 2-3 combos each, I think once Punisher took 4 combos. (note some of these times might be jumbled/fuzzy) I then decided to just 100% 3.2 then 100% 3.1. It was 6 more paths than 5 more paths. I wasn't really looking at the clock but once those two were 100%, it had already been about 1:30...fuck. I knew it was getting bad around the 4th path in 3.1. Once those were done I jumped back to 1.1 and 1.2 and 100% those. By then it was already 2 hours in. That was it. I knew there was no chance as I still had 4 paths in both 2.1 and 2.2. Those alone would take me to 2:30 which means even if I miraculously finished Master quest in the exact same time, it'd still be 5 hours which won't cut it (especially with people posting sub-4 hours this one). So all in all, it's bad. It's **really bad**. There's absolutely no hope with Android. I feel like posting this on their forums, knowing full well they'll be radio-silent just like they always are when someone brings this up over there. So, don't waste your time Android users. Find a friend/family member with an iPhone if you really wanna do it. Hope this saves a few hours from someone else though.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2017-08-30 22:52:12</DATE>
    <TEXT>Edit: [This has been reported already on the forums.](https://forums.playcontestofchampions.com/en/discussion/19129/fights-not-registering#latest) So I watched it happen when I had an auto-fight going in the new quest (heroic mode, first path, no biggie). But I thought I was seeing things, or that maybe it timed out since I was half paying attention, but upon restarting it my champ had full health as did the opponent. Weird. Didn't think much of it. Someone in discord just reported the same thing, which to me confirms something funky is going on. About to submit it on their forums but wanted to gather a little more data for them before doing so if possible. Guy in discord just got done fighting Rhino in LoL and it just restarted as if nothing had happen the last 10 minutes. Talk about a kick in the nuts.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>QNAP NAS experiencing extremely slow upload speeds to the internet (cloud backup). Talking around ~35kbps. Downloading seems fine.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-02-10 17:31:32</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hey guys, first off, awesome community here. 10 year redditor and never knew this sub existed. With that said, I've googled the last 2 days with zero success. Every single result turns out to be someone complaining about NAS  lt;-- gt; Computer network speeds, I can't find anything or anyone having an issue with the NAS having network speed issues **uploading to the internet**. My downloads are fine, and my computers, on wifi, can upload at almost 10mbps. Wifi is obviously not as reliable as wired so I know something's not right and it's not the internet connection itself (but maybe something in the NAS or modem/router). Im using both Azure backup and the new QNAP Hybrid backup app and running some tests by sending some files from the NAS to Google Drive. I was testing this new app because I'm wanting to backup the almost 1TB of video I have on the NAS to a 3rd party location/device (gotta love that redundancy) and noticed the upload speeds were crazy slow. Took like 5 minutes to send 35mb of pdf documents. That's when I went to go look at my Azure logs and noticed the same dismal speeds apparently happening the last few months - I just never noticed since they're done at like 3am. I don't even know where to start to troubleshoot. I have a direct 1gb wired ethernet connection from the NAS to the modem (modem/router combo). I purchased it off Amazon so I wasn't giving Comcast free money every month on lease fees. It's a great modem and never have issues with it. It's an Arris (forget model but can get that if needed). If anyone has any suggestions, I'd greatly appreciate it, thanks again! NAS: QNAP TS-221 Modem: Arris TG-xxx 1Gbps ethernet connection to modem (confirmed via NAS Interface) PS: As I mentioned earlier I have about 1TB of movies I really wanna have a 2nd backup of incase the NAS goes to shit. I have all my "important" stuff backing up to Azure but never uploaded the movies cause I didn't want to pay the extra costs at the time, nor did I think I cared about them as much, but now I do. If you guys suggest just putting them on an external drive I might go that route instead. I just prefer to have it in the cloud instead of a 2nd physical medium.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>14.2m Platinum 3 alliance looking for 1. Tier 3 2400 war rating. No event minimums and run 5x5 AQ and come in around 420. We run 65555 off war season. Were looking for someone who can hold their own in war first and foremost *at the level we're playing*. You're experienced and familiar with tier 3 war. You're able to clear your path. You understand the need for using boosts/pots and not giving up attack bonus. Boss killers a bonus. **Edit** you must have at the very least two 5* R4s, more preferred. You have a good defensive squad and can be ready for a diverse squad if needed and have those diverse defenders be strong. Were actually a very laid back, friendly, long standing group of people who get the job done. If this sounds like your idea of a great alliance then hit me up on Line under the same name.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So if you're like me and know pretty much every nuance of the entire series, you'll know that in the final scene of the series as JD is driving out of the hospital parking lot, [there's two cars on the road outside the hospital braking (their brake lights come on)](http://imgur.com/Pk3EUz6). This road wasn't closed down during this shoot as it's the main road alongside the set. While watching this episode again I couldn't help but wonder how awesome it would have been to purposely drive down that road while filming so my cars brake lights could be part of the final episode... Yes I'm weird. I miss this show :( Side note: I love how you can see the ambulance staged off to the side with its lights on and being radioed to drive in once JD puts the car in reverse.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>We've all been there - there's a song in your head that you can't figure out and it goes by the wayside or you end up finding it with ID help. For me, I've had a song lodged in the back of my head since 2000 or so. I took a break from EDM in general from around 2002-2015, since coming back I've thought about this song many times and could hear it in my head - faintly. To the point where trying to ID it would be impossible. Well this morning as I'm Scrolling through Facebook I see a liked video from a friend of "classic EDM nostalgia" and decided to listen to it. All of a sudden a song comes on that made me stop everything, this was my song. I look at the video and see the artist/title and immediately YouTube it to confirm that's the song.... It was. I finally found the song stuck in my head, unidentified, for 18 years. Over the moon right now. The song in question is [Safri Duo - Played A Live](https://youtu.be/mnzmUyHr1S8)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Bill Lawrence, Scrubs showrunner has the same role on CT. Much of the cast is crossover (with the exact same personality), the comedy is exactly the same, the music is exactly the same, and Bill himself has said in interviews he considers the two shows to live in the same universe. **BIG NOTE:** If you do decide to start watching CT there's something you MUST consider - the first 6 episodes of Season 1 are COMPLETELY different from the rest of the entire series. They had different plans for the style of the show and decided to ditch it entirely and go the "scrubs" route. I'd only recommend even watching the first 6 episodes just to get acclimated to the general characters, outside of that those episodes are "season 9" of the show - not necessary to the watch.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I mean, lots of people use a merc not cause they don't have the skill to do something, but because they don't have the time. I know what my time is worth and sometimes it's cheaper for me to spend a certain amount of money if it'd take longer for me to do hourly. I've thought about using a merc for arena simply to rack up BCs so I can get gold. I hate arena with a passion and never run it more than 2m points or so just for BCs, but paying someone $5 for 1m points is pretty dam appealing. I don't even care about ranking! Just want the BCs for gold. It's pretty sad actually. Now I will say paying a merc to get you a speedrun title is pretty lame and why I don't take that title into consideration when recruiting...many paid someone or they got it themselves but they're far from skilled.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So really good damage when an opponent is under 25% makes them demi god? You could say that for a ton of champs out there. Hell Vulture does insane damage after an L2, doesn't make him demi god. What im trying to say is the demi\-god tier list needs to be defined better, otherwise any champ that "does something good" can get looped in, and honestly, Elektra isn't a demi\-god lol. Ask any end\-game player for a champ suggestion for any part in the game and rarely do you ever hear "Elektra". She's the very definition of "good". Nothing more. If she's Demi god, then Vulture, Karnak, and Kamala Kahn is too based on their "one thing they can do at one point in the fight".</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If he's not showcased by Seatin than reddit won't know about them. Same goes for that goofy tier list that had like 15 "demi god" champs that are mostly "ok" (drax, elektra, etc). I'm convinced that list is severely fucking up the understanding of many variables for a large population of non veteran players. The entire God tier scenario itself is situational, God tier can be God tier in one mode but not in another. TLDR - people need to start reading the descriptions of their champs for themselves and not rely on one person's opinion.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey there, about 10 years ago I was stuck in a **nasty** loop myself. I had around EIGHT different loans out at once. Every paycheck I got basically went to interest/partial payback charges. I was so hopeless and didn't know what to do until I came across a forum post for people in the same situation. My entire life changed for the better with one small, easy solution... Get your bank account information changed. Go to your bank, tell them there's fraud going on and that you're trying to pay back one of the loans in full but they're not responding and only taking the partial payment each week. It's not entirely a lie either cause many of these shady companies make it impossible to reach someone. Or tell them one of the companies operates out of the islands and is associated with fraud, something along those lines and trust me they'll sympathize, they know how shady these companies are. Just tell them you need a new account number (which fir bank of America it was simply closing out the account and reopening one right there). Boom, now they can't take it automatically and you have **your entire paycheck to yourself for the first time again *. Yes, you will get a shit load of phone calls. Yes it will be annoying. No, it's not as bad as finally having your money again. Tell them you'll pay them back one at a time. They'll threaten you but the reality is they won't sue you, they're a collection agency essentially that just wants their money. Make a payment plan that you can manage and DON'T GIVE THEM YOUR NEW BANK INFO. Pay than via western union or moneygram. PM me if you need someone to talk to, I've been there. The day I got my paycheck without 7 loan companies taking their slice was the most freeing feeling in the world, trust me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Void doesn't need to be duped to be amazing. His dupe ability is only worthwhile during **long ass fights**.

There's a lot of champs in that pool that if I pulled I'd be really annoyed.

    <TEXT>As someone who fights this fight every other day, I'm surprised you exclusively use L2, any reason fur that? Is it just for the indestructible charges? If you spam L1 it let's you attack more frequently since you'll have the unstoppable charges, so you can dash back and bait them to charge you, you just block and go in for the conbo. Two of those per L1 then once you see 20+ bleed stacks save to L3 and she's done. I dunno i usually fight R5s so time is the biggest factor for me and spamming L1 gets the fight finished much quicker imo.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Community Correction: Void doesn't *need* to be duped. Allow me to break it down and explain.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-06-20 17:27:35</DATE>
    <TEXT>A lot of people are now pulling his 6\* and that's awesome! Unfortunately there's a lot of misinformation going around stating he's trash unduped - and this couldn't be farther from the truth. I was going to post this a few weeks ago but decided against it for no reason. However now it's time to release this into the wild. --- Howdy folks, it seems more and more I'm seeing people all around the community ask if Void needs to be duped to be any good - or - I'm seeing lots of people *insinuate* he needs to be Awakened to be effective when someone shares a pull of him. I wanted to clear the air on this. No, it's not mandatory that Void be Awakened in order to reverse regen/power gain. You can in fact have an unduped void and take out nodes 24  amp; 48 like a boss. First off, my source/context: been playing a 5* R4 Awakened Void since the day he came out (just to backup my statements with noted experiences) Let me start by giving a quick overview of his primary mechanics: - Void naturally and automatically applies 3 different types of debuffs, with each stacking to 2 every 10-14 seconds - He can also apply a debuff by using his L1 special - once you have all 6 debuffs applied (2 stacks of the 3 different debuffs) the cycle will end after a few seconds and start over - each unique debuff also does direct damage - one of the 3 debuffs is petrify, which is the one matters, this lowers regen and power gain by 50% each stack. The goal of the fight is to get the 2 petrify debuffs up as early as possible and it's all RNG unfortunately but against naturally regen/power gain champs like mephisto or Hyperion I've noticed RNG tends to apply the petrify debuff more commonly... same with applying agility debuff more commonly early on against evaders...this could be a tin foil hat of mine though or purely anecdotal but I've definitely noticed this be the case. Now, with that all said, that's all unduped. This means if you get two petrify debuffs their regen and power gain is shut off completely, and if you have the despair mastery it will actually **reverse** the regen/power gain. This is why he's so coveted for AW nodes 24  amp; 48. "So Bagel, why does everyone say he **needs** to be duped?" I don't know, I don't think they fully understand how he works! What his dupe ability does, is after all 6 stacks are applied and you either use your L1 or the natural timer expires and gets ready to set another debuff they combine their effects into a "fear of the void" passive debuff that lasts **40 seconds** - this debuff does not do direct damage, but it does still have the combined effects of each debuff (petrify, agility, fatigue). This debuff also raises your attack tremendously and allows the next cycle of debuffs to apply one by one faster. So if you have the FotV passive applied and start the cycle again the petrify debuffs will definitely reverse the regen since it's now - 50% or - 100% if you have both petrify debuffs up and FotV. Even more if you have Despair! However - if RNGesus is in your favor and you're able to get off the two petrify debuffs early on in the cycle, you'll have those running as long as it takes for the remaining debuffs to be applied which can be up to a minute! Which means *don't use his L1 during this time as it will just shorten the overall time you have the petrify debuffs up*. Instead use his L2 and get a degen or weakness debuff going! I've fought hundreds of difficult fights from uncollected event fights to node 24/48/minibosses where fear of the void **never even kicked in** because the fight ended before that even happened. This is why it's NOT necessary for void to be duped to carry you through the buffet/arc overload nodes in AW or any other difficult match you face. It just makes the fight a bit shorter if he's duped. You'll really only notice his dupe ability during long fights. So if you're out there with an unduped void on the bench go rank him up!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Finally soloing R5 Medusa boss (tier 3) with my newly acquired 6\* KM who I took to R2. The first few tries after getting him I was still nervous/feeling him out...fights were going horribly. I remember one where almost 90 seconds in and she had yet to throw a special where I wasnt in the corner...Had to have other boss killers swoop in for the kill each time, it was pretty demoralizing. Then, it happen. And on a bumpy train of all places (not my typical happy place). Boosted up, and the fight went absolutely perfectly - she was throwing specials left and right allowing me to keep True Strike on pretty much the entire fight. Every couple hits were striking critical raising that bleed counter up fast...She had about 35% health left and I unleashed the L3 with 42 bleed stacks on the counter and it was game over. I was so proud. Ever since then it's been easier and easier.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I tried explaining this to someone on line the other day, but it's all about visibility by the Investors/Board/Leadership (I currently work in analytics and have to gather data/present data to leadership all the time). Those guys listed above do nothing but look at reports and dashboards (a collection of summarized reports) everyday/week/month. These are how they make decisions - all decisions that affect the company. When there's a line graph representing DAUs (daily active users) over time that's steady at X and slightly rising - and then has one day with a massive "dip" in it, it looks REALLY BAD and angers the top people in the company. They'll get asked at \*every single meeting\* "why the dip that day, what the hell happened"? And they'll have to explain why...Every. Single. Time. That can then lead to "well what do we do to fix this so it never happens again". Thats' the goal.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Little advice from someone who fights this fight every other day. After you use your L1 dash back and block and let her charge you so she bounced off and you get 4 free hits, do it again, 5 hits and L1 again. You'll have much more time to spare. Also start saving up for your L3 when she's around 40% health, or 30% if R5. Then by the time it's ready she'll have around 25-30 bleed stacks and will be dead when you use it.</TEXT>

How often does an announcement sticky need to be made? Rarely. So when that does happen, just demote the brag post or awakening sticky for the temporary time being. It's not like they disappear, they just have to scroll down a bit more to find them (or link to it in the sidebar)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey there, so I'm having a brain fart and it's Friday. So there's that. Essentially, I have a table of data that has one row per product owned by each customer, like below: Customer|Product| :--|:--| Customer Acme|Product A| Customer Acme|Product B| Customer Billy|Product A| Customer Billy|Product C| I'm trying to get it to display like the below, where it's one row per customer, and each product column has an X marked in it if they own that particular product. As in, the above data would output into the below table format: Customer|Product A|Product B|Product C|Product D|Product E|Product F| :--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--| Customer Acme|X|X||||| Customer Billy|X||X|||| Any help would be super appreciated, I feel like I need to use COUNTIF with this somewhere somehow lol. I'm familiar with COUNTIF, but there's def a piece that I'm missing. Thanks in advance, really appreciate it!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>FYI it's a nice show of solidarity to give the Marvel Strike Force guys a chance to get the Groot reward if you're not playing that game.

    <TEXT>That dude is so not worth the time of day. I remember one thread about war tiers earlier this year or late last year where he went on for 13 pages incorrectly defending how the rating/tier system worked. Dude was also outed as being barely mid-level player (prob around 250k rating in a 4-5m alliance) yet he constantly tries to argue topics relevant to end-game players and top tier alliances. He's the definition of someone who talks out of his ass with zero experience in like 80% of his arguments.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's weird because before they bought kabam, they were extremely generous with compensation and other stuff. I remember the game going down for a few hours in Star Wars Force Arena and they essentially gave the equivalent of a 4* to everyone. Their drop rates were super fair and deals were actually valuable. I think when they bought kabam they let the kabam execs take over (seriously) and let go of the NM execs.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Honestly it's annoying seeing these same teams on here complaining about not being able to smash into the highest level. It specifically says "this is only for the craziest players" or whatever it says. They're **purposely** making it near impossible right now so they can stunt progression, Im sure it's for the betterment of the game's longevity. Also what happens when you finish the last tier? You have nothing to strive for. This isn't anything new in games like this. They'll most likely lower the requirements in the near future so they can raise the cap on tier levels as more people are picking up the game.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi, been using Void/KM on war attack since the day KM was released in the feature 6* and I pulled him (few months now?) I had always taken path 7, then 6/7 and it does fairly well. I now take 5 and 2 out of the last 3 wars I took node 37 and successfully nullified the poison altogether with KM, the 3rd time I didn't nullify the poison I was still able to take out the opponent before 60 seconds (my KM is R2). Does it replace the holy trinity? No. To me they serve two entirely different purposes though. I will say that void has been integral in taking out node 42  amp; 52 (lower right miniboss) with near 100% success in soloing. KM let's me solo R5 Medusa boss 9/10 times. His counter punch charges are also really advantageous against the boss since they're stun immune and masochism/buffet nodes since you don't have to evade or dance with them to get a combo in. It's definitely an amazing attack team when put in the right hands.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not gonna lie, I did this as a fully competant 23 year old while on a caribbean cruise excursion cave tubing adventure in the jungle. We were tubing in this fast-ish flowing river in the jungle and there's like 40 of us, next thing I know I've drifted away from the pack and I'm caught in a mini whirlpool where I'm just spinnning and spinning and I can't control my tube for the life of me....I look and the nearest person is like 50 yards from me and can't hear me screaming for help due to the waterfalls around. I start to panic and am screaming at th the top of my lungs for help then finally one of the guides sees me and starts running over towards me....\*running\*.... By the time he got to about 10 yards from me and I saw he was in knee high water it "clicked" to me.....put my feet down and stood up...I was in waist high water. Felt like a complete ass hat, he was a good sport about it though. Moral of the story - when panic takes over you do really moronic shit.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I play a few other big mobile games and this is beyond bizarre - offering compensation by way of a 'deal'.

    <TEXT>I have no idea what your line of business is, how you plan to use SF, etc...but it sounds like you should probably create a custom object to log that type of info and leave the standard Case object as is for something maybe down the line that more fits the nature of the case object simply cause it has so much out of the box relationships with the rest of the system and what not.... I dunno I'm just picturing a time log style object that you log a date for that contact and call it a day. It's like having a Xbox 360 and using it solely for a DVD player.</TEXT>

Grow the fuck up. Edit: vile</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've been wanting to bring up the whole Trump supporter thing, and just say that there's a MASSIVE population of Latino Trump supporters (more so conservative voters) in South Florida, which is where he's originally from before going out to LA. I don't think he's supporting Trump to be "RaNdOm" or attention seeking, but probably because he simply grew up being in a traditional South Florida Latino republican household.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As someone who's rewatched the entire series over 30 times (yes you read that right), I'd wager to say season 5 and even season 8 are up there in top 5. Scrubs truly had a remarkable run and all 8 (core) seasons were fantastic. If I had to pick a weak link I'd go with 7 and that's cause writers were on strike and you could tell it suffered from that.</TEXT>
