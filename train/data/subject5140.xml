    <DATE>2014-06-10 13:18:10</DATE>
    <TEXT>couple questions here. i am very confused by this war. as far as i know assad has been pounding the hell out of targets which includes civillians, even using chemical weapons. on the other hand i hear that the opposition is killing shiites indiscriminately. so as far as i see both sides of this war are pretty fucked up, i cant really pick a side here. i believe there is also a third side of ruthless foreign fighters from iraq. i am definitely against this group. this group seems to be fighting both assad and the opposition. any ideas on why one side is morally better than the other? i remember in the first days of the syrian protests where iranian flags were being burnt. also i have heard commentators speculate that prior to the civil war assad was urged by his iranian advisers to crush the protests, and not give an inch. how true is this? i realize that iran is now elbows deep in the civil war, but prior to the civil war, during the protests, how much of a role did iranian advisers play?</TEXT>

    <DATE>2014-10-08 07:46:12</DATE>
    <TEXT>When ISIS was taking one Turkemen city after another I dont remember reading anything about Turks storming European parliaments, or burning down buildings in Turkey and killing police. Not only did Turkey not intervene to save Turkemen cities, Turkemen refugees were not even allowed into Turkey and were forced to camp in tents inside Iraq and starve. In a similar way, there is the Armenian libel attacks against Turks. There is ample evidence that Armenians were the ones massacring Turks in a campaign of ethnic cleansing aimed at creating an Armenian homeland in eastern Turkey. Yet Turks dont run around assassinating Armenians, or constantly propagate against Armenian interests. Since these groups are so loud, people obviously start giving them more relevance. Most people dont even realize that Iraqi Turkemens exist, despite the fact that they number as much as 2 million in iraq. you never hear Obama mention them in his speeches, you dont hear any talk of autonomy or future state for them. Most people in Turkey dont even give a fuck about them. It seems Turks are always quiet like sheep heading for slaughter. At the same time we are one of the most hated people on earth. It is really amazing to read some of the writings of European enlightenment era "thinkers", and then compare them to modern European writers and politicians like Thilo Sarrazin and Zhirinovsky.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Questioning Islam, and debating religious dogma.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2015-01-18 23:42:45</DATE>
    <TEXT>The more you attack a group of people, the more they will dig into their beliefs. Thats why I think the Europeans dont have good intentions when they attack Islam and the prophet. They attack Muslims because they want people in the middle east to be more religious, more crazy, and more ignorant. The best way to eradicate Islam is by questioning it, and using logic, not by mass genocide and racism. I made [this](http://np.reddit.com/r/islam/comments/2stnfa/do_you_believe_in_heavenhell_if_so_what_is_your/) post in /r/islam, to have an actual debate on the subject. I encourage people to question every little detail, and challenge people's long held religious beliefs. You will not convince them in a single debate, since people dont like admitting defeat. However, the seeds of doubt you plant in them, will grow and eventually they will stop believing in superstition and nonsense. This is related to /r/turkey, because whether or not turkey will continue regressing and eventually turn into another Iran or Afghanistan depends on our ability to knock some sense into these people.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>First it was the Kurds over ain al Arab (kobane). Then it was the armenians over ISIS violence in Kassab ([which turned out to be a total fabrication](http://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/middle-east/2014/04/07/Horror-movie-image-used-in-Syria-s-Kessab-war-hoax-.html)). Now the Assyrians are accusing Turkey of genocide for not helping more with their ["1915-2015" posters](http://media.sanluisobispo.com/smedia/2015/02/26/13/43/559-swPww.AuSt.55.jpeg).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>[a very one sided book by a British officer](http://www.aina.org/books/tota.pdf). I found it interesting that even in this book he admitted quiet a bit (though attempting to justify every act): 1) that Assyrians had declared war on the ottomans despite repeated attempts by ottomans to persuade them not to join the invading Russians. (pg 18) 2) Assyrians feared that if they didnt make war on the turks, after the allies won the war they would get nothing, or be punished by the allies. (pg 18) 3) The Assyrians leaders had murdered Assyrians who refused to go to war with the Ottomans. (pg 20) 4) The Assyrians now armed to the teeth by the russians occupying iranian azerbaijan. the local inhabitants were "were too frightened to do much". they looted and killed the local muslims at will as "bloody revenge for their lost villages". (pg 21) 5)The Assyrians massacred inhabitants of cities in retaliation to military defeats at the hand of the kurds. (pg23) the title is "Tragedy of the Assyrians". I really had to pause and wonder how the author believes the massacre of the defenseless population of urumia by these bastards was justified. this book is from www.aina.org, which is a nationalist Assyrian site. I didnt read all of it, most of the book is nonsense about ancient history, and other irrelevant material.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I noticed the folks in /r/kurdistan are posting some graphic content. It got me wondering if it is appropriate to have a subreddit dedicated for such content. When graphic content gets posted here, there is usually some bickering and outrage. It seems to me that the current PKK conflict is going to continue for several more months if not years. we are missing out on quiet a bit of material that is simply not appropriate to post in /r/turkey. so why not have a place like /r/watchPKKdeaths dedicated to it? this is just a suggestion i will probably delete it. If pkk supporters want to make a subreddit /r/watchturksdie as a counterbalance then that is fine.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>i would say the attitude you are describing is a reaction to the internet PKK sympathizers. PKK burns down a 500 year old mosque, and the comments are "good for kurds", "fuck turkey", "burn down more mosques",... a turk will read nasty comments and calibrate his own comments accordingly. it is definitely wrong to generalize, the average kurd in turkey doesnt support PKK. i have heard from first hand accounts that the locals call the turkish police all the time and inform them of where a bomb is buried. many of the police and soldiers on the ground are from the local population. civilians that get killed the most by PKK are the locals. the infastructure damage, drug trafficking, child kidnapping by PKK all harms the local population more than anyone else.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>i agree with him that US never helped the PKK. i dont agree with everything else he said. were villages destroyed? yes, villages that sheltered PKK fighters had to be destroyed. these were extremely effective and successful operations. i think the turkish army did a great job back then. right now i get the feeling their hands are tied, but they still do damn good work, and they do it with professionalism and discipline of a [brain surgeon working on a patient](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_6zrWlWMx0).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>dont be so sure. killing PKK eases the tension and agitation in the community. obviously they will be saddened by loss of family member, just as you would be saddened if a family member committed suicide or died from drug overdose. its like saying killing murderers will encourage murder, it makes no sense.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>it is similar in that they chose to go down the wrong path. they made the decision to join a terrorist organization that is killing people in the streets on a daily basis. im sure most of their family members understand that, even if they do sympathize, they would not want that path for their loved ones. the friction with the turkish state is caused by PKK, digging trenches, laying bombs, and forcing the government to declare curfew. imagine if gun men were setting up checkpoints, laying bombs and shooting police on the streets in the US. what would happen?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>europe needs to take in at least as much refugees as turkey. especially germany, after what they did in the holocaust. also i think there are enough turks and kurds in germany so that we should want some autonomy. give us some region so we can declare our own countries, if it is not given to us peacefully we might start setting off explosives in german schools, and shooting german police. same with other countries in europe. france needs to recognize algerian/indochina genocides, i think some french diplomats and embassy workers need to start getting killed until they get the message. the swedes are responsible for genocide of saami, dutch played a huge role in atlantic slave trade, none of these countries have payed for their crimes.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>federal system is something you form with another state or independent entity. for example in the US several states chose to join and form a federal union. for turkey to become a federal country, it would first have to voluntarily or by force be split up into several independent entities. then they sit down and decide if the independent entities even want to form a federal union. during the negotiations we would decide federal powers vs. state powers and many other details that must first be agreed upon. it would make more sense for us to form a federal union with azerbaijan, since two independent states already exist all we have to do is put through a serious effort by both governments. this is the only possible way turkey could become a federal country. we can form federal union with many of central asian nations as well. however breaking turkey up to form a "federal country" would be a bloody affair, no turk would agree to it voluntarily.</TEXT>

PKK on the other hand, targets schools, ambulances, there is no international laws or norms for groups like PKK. turkey on the other hand has legal obligations, european court of human rights ruled that the curfews were justified and legal. what is the legal basis for blowing up schools, hospitals, burying bombs in civilian neighborhoods? kurds being forced to eat shit until PKK came along LOL. yeah,</TEXT>

Q:name me a single german city jews captured? Q:name me a single military defeat jews inflicted on the germans? Q:how much german territory were jews claiming, and are claiming today (ie. motive to lie)? Q: how many germans did jews massacre? Q: how much german territory had jews conquered before getting "genocided"? LOL keep comparing it to the holocaust, you only prove our point that it wasnt a genocide.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; Genocide is the intentional action to systematically eliminate an ethnic, national, racial or religious group. that is the key point, if you cant show *intentional*, *systematic* effort then its not genocide. that would entail, hundreds of telegraphs, letters, documents,....ect. yet they cant show a single *authentic* document. kurdish tribes massacring armenian villages independently from turkish command is an atrocity, but not genocide, certainly not one turkish government would be held responsible for. Talat pasha's relocation plan had strict guidelines towards armenian lives and property. it was a temporary measure, similar to japanese relocation during WW2. no where did talat pasha order any sort of massacre or atrocity.

In the malta trials, all charges of genocide were dropped due to lack of evidence. in reality the british had full control over ottoman documents and archives. during the war rumors of "genocide" were spread as propaganda against the ottomans, yet after the war the british government didnt have enough evidence to convict anyone.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; No of course, the poor Pashas had no idea that Armenians couldn't store water in their humps when they force-marched them to Syria, so they all died in the desert! An act of god, truly. if the intent was to kill them in a forced march, that must be the most cumbersome way to commit genocide. compare that to the industrial scale of nazis, or factory style killing by ustashas. do you think mongols with their medival age technology force marched people to kill them. the resources required to assign the army during wartime to relocate hundreds of thousands of people, and then to have most of them survive the trip safe and sound. we really suck at genocide. few died due to disease and conditions. few got harassed and killed by raiders and tribal warlords who wanted to loot their belongings or take revenge. most of them survived, which is why there are so many lebanese/syrian armenians (incidentally most lebanese/syrain armenians have migrated to the west through no fault of the turks).</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;So your strongest piece of evidence is a Wikipedia citation of scholarly work that's 40 years out of date and relies entirely on the record-keeping ability of a state that was about to collapse? i cited a scientific journal that also happens to have also been cited in wikipedia. i said nothing about it being my "strongest" piece of evidence. the only fault you could find is "40 year old journal", that is "outdated"? the journal simply presented Ottoman census data, if you look up Ottoman census data today, 20 years from now 40 years from now, it would say the same thing as when shaw was writing his journal. the rest of your argument is simply attacks and accusing me of lying without a single citation to any source. what were the numbers then? show me better sources than ottoman census.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;So what you guys would do if you were me? i wouldnt care, i like bbw's and i get the vibe that your girl friend was probably not a bbw.  gt;How would you feel? i would go to a black club. there is always more bbw's there.  gt;Whats your opinions about this story? if she was a bbw, i would be depressed too. but knowing weak modern men who cant handle all that meat like i can. she was probably too skinny for me to have an opinion about her.  gt;Who was the wrong one, me or her? you, your taste in women sucks. [go find a nice juicy bbw](http://weheartit.com/e_traveler/collections/93707576-bbw), then come back and ask me these questions.  gt;Did I do something wrong? you based your happiness on someone else. she probably sensed the desperation. that other guy is fucking her brains out right now. now if she was a bbw, she would be just as desperate as you, and other guy would probably be one of those fools who doesnt like some meat on the bones. so you wouldnt really be having any of these problems.</TEXT>

"Turkey supports ISIS" is just russian propaganda, nearly every coalition airstrike against ISIS is out of turkey, while [90% of russian airstrikes are against Assad's opposition groups](http://static4.businessinsider.com/image/561f8cd4bd86ef195c8b6d3c/map-russian-airstrikes-in-syria-are-helping-isis-and-assad.jpg). powerful russian propaganda machine spins this into " russia fighting ISIS". trump is just riding on the successful russian propaganda. if he gets into office the US policy is not going to change one bit.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Is it okay when the Turkish State burns villages? if the villages are being used as bases for terrorists, yes, burn them to the ground relocate the population.  gt;...murders and tortures thousands of people self defense is not murder. when you start setting off bombs in cities, and massacring civilian population, you shouldnt cry when security forces are sent to deal with the threat.  gt;When they siege cities for months cities that have bombs buried in civilian populated neighborhoods, where civilians are shot in their homes for not cooperating with terrorists and so on...  gt;shell homes, shoot some of their inhabitants everyone knows damn well only terrorists are targeted. terrorists who are known to target ambulances. there are terrorists snipers everywhere, roadside bombs burried which has killed many civilians and the turkish army is only there to eliminate the threat.  gt;I suppose you're also okay with them slaughtering 1.5 million Armenians, 350.000 Greeks, 20.000 Assyrians? the real numbers are 20% of that, and yes, im okay with the killing of 300k armenian during a war where [armenians killed more than twice that many people](http://imgur.com/a/WjTlk). the assyrians were all killed by kurds, this is a well established fact.  gt;because of its terrorist acts, the Turkish State shouldn't be used as a political tool. Turkish state only "terrorises" terrorists and their supporters. that really isnt considered terrorism. Kurdish terrorists on the other hand, set off suicide bombs in cities, blow up schools, ambulances, ... if that is your political tool, that's fine too. but then dont cry when 90% of the population votes for political parties that back tougher military action on kurdish PKK terrorism. that is the whole difference between state's use of force and the use of force by PKK. a state's force (or state terrorism from PKK supporter's point of view) is considered legitimate since it represents the will of the people.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>oh wow, the azeri soldier had a video talking about the armenian soldier blowing himself up with a grenade. what he was saying makes sense now, i was confused before. there is quiet a bit of difference from the azeri soldier's version of the story than the wiki page. [i translated some of it here before](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/4hgl5x/aliev_awarding_the_officer_seen_in_the_armenian/d2ptyj8), of course it got down voted into oblivion.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>im not arguing what is a bad act. taking a head back to the village is very unprofessional and abnormal thing to do. what sloyan did as his last act, may be admirable from one point of view, but it really pissed them off. surrendering, only to then throw a grenade at the people showing mercy is not something that should be encouraged. people should be able to surrender if they dont want to die, that is a human right, and this just ruins it for the next guy trying to legitimately surrender.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Europeans fighting tooth and nail against refugeese, are now concerned about anti- terror laws in turkey. The government continues to kiss their ass for some reason. Turkey should have gone Iran's path long ago. The pkk problem is Percisely becouse Europe dictates turkey's policy. No death penalty, peace process with pkk, "reforms" with the only intent of weakening law enforcement and state control.</TEXT>

Why should they be shelled and attacked by Turkey for trying to advance and hold ground so ISIS can't take it back? because those areas have been vacated by ISIS due to FSA/Turkey advance. YPG is essentially blocking further FSA/Turkey advance by capturing those positions. obviously turkey/FSA doesnt want to be helping its enemy ypg/pkk.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>YPG has been fighting ISIS only to grab more arab lands, cleanse them ethnically, change city names to kurdish in order to create their separatist dream. Turkish intentions has been clear since day one, ISIS and YPG are equally considered terrorists. i cant believe you are complaining why turkey hasn't helped YPG/PKK enough! the only thing turkey owes YPG/PKK is artillery shells on top of their heads.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Part of it is hypocrisy. But mostly because Hamas is actual administrator and representative of Palestinians in territories they govern. Palestinians who are not citizens of Israel. Hamas is kind of like a government. Pkk doesn't represent anyone who isn't already represented by the virtue of being Turkish citizens. Imagine if there was a terror group originating from Israeli arabs who are Israeli citizens, that's what pkk is like.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>if PKK controls territory in an official manner, then they would be similar to Hamas. YPG syrian branch of PKK is closer to Hamas in that regard, but their situation is fluid. they are within syrias international borders, their status is not "official" or internationally recognized. YPG's status is more similar to ISIS than to Hamas. countries will label their own enemies as terrorists.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; as a Turk on Reddit or English-speaking internet in general, have absolutely nothing but your ego to lose by acknowledging the Armenian Genocide, and a lot to gain. im from kars, my ancestors were massacred by armenians. why would i accept bullshit? they did the same thing in karabkh war against azeri civilians. how many front page reddit posts do you see about that? problem is idiots who think they can kiss enough ass, and win at propaganda doing it. then you yourself become another weapon in their propaganda machine. with no regard for the truth, "why dont you just acknowledge it and it will go away". what about the [mass graves](http://www.nationalturk.com/en/mass-graves-found-in-erzurum-turkey-of-armenian-massacre-88874554/) from armenian atrocities? how many armenians are acknowledging their ancestors were committing genocide in eastern anatolia?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>genocide is a systematic campaign to eliminate an ethnic/religious group. you cant show a single document of communication from top to down ordering massacres of armenians. not a single telegram, letter, document ordering commanders, officers, soldiers to massacre Armenians. on top of that they have lost every single international court case regarding "armenian genocide", including one just recently. the accusation has never even made to an international genocide tribunal. they have failed time and again to prove it, and can only push their agenda by political lobbying. so no, im not going to accept something that didnt happen.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;According to the UN, genocide is: (b) Causing serious bodily harm, or harm to mental health, to members of the group; (c) Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part; Do you deny that these happened to Armenians? do armenians deny they were committing these things? or are you only interested turks accepting having committed genocide based on those broad definitions.  gt;If Anatolian locals decided that they have had enough with Armenian attacks and ended up going around killing any Armenian they found, it would still have been a genocide. Some argue that the ongoing attacks against white South Africans is a genocide. then the government would be blameless. it would be simply intercommunal violence that Armenians themselves had more than their share in committing.  gt;The what? The UN recognize the genocide, as do the International Association of Genocide Scholars. firstly UN does not recognize it. secondly just because "International Association of Genocide Scholars" has the words "international" and "genocide scholar" in the name doesnt give them any credibility. what makes them international, other that getting a few signatures? they are just another group ideologically motivated to push armenian lies.</TEXT>

Thus, it is normal that people pay more attention to what happened to them. lol, thats why people pay more attention? it has nothing to do with ASALA blowing up or murdering turkish citizens to gain publicity for genocide? it has nothing to do with pathological armenian obsession with pushing their genocide recognition agenda like it was their religion? why dont Congolese get 1% of the attention when belgians killed millions of them?  gt;Except there actually was a law that ordered the forced resettlement of Armenians, which resulted in most Armenian deaths. Exactly, ordered forced resettlement of Armenians of armenians, not genocide. 80% of armenians survived the resettlement, according to justin Mcarthy more fraction survived the Turkish resettlement that those who fled with the russians. US resetteld east coast japanese during ww2, noone is rushing to call it a genocide.  gt; Either way I think the current states are blameless, anyway. It is stupid to hold people who are alive today accountable for things that happened a century ago. Guess why people won't listen to this argument. people will listen, namely turkish people will listen to the suffering of turkish people. we dont need anyone elses sympathies.</TEXT>

That is the definition of it. during the time turkish civilians and soldiers were dying at an ever higher rate. as I said, the ones that fled with the russians under their own volition had a larger death rate, than the ones relocated by ottoman army. if the ottomans wanted to kill them they wouldn't spend the resources and logistics to relocate them, it makes no sense. certainly 80% wouldn't have survived it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;People also get killed because they talk or sing in Kurdish. here is [deputy prime minister of turkey speaking in KURDISH](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nso9Dua2Kvs), he is still alive, and still one of the most powerful people in the country. in recent statements by UK government, UK is actually far more resistant to assisting YPG than the US. There are various Kurdish organizations Turkey supports as well like the iraqi kurdistan government. as far as assimilation goes, minorities should assimilate, but this is not something that is forced. simply Kurdish not being the official language of turkey doesnt legitimize terrorism and murder. kurdish is not official language in Iran either, but because the relative strictness, greater government control, and capital punishment you dont see them having the same terrorism issue. anti terror operations have greatly reduced number of terrorist attacks in the country. Thus this is a security issue more than anything. what you are saying is similar to saying UK should stop bombing ISIS, or stop certain activities in the middle east, and that would prevent future ISIS attacks. ISIS is an islamist organization with islamic extremist agenda, the same way PKK is an extreme ethnonationalist organization, with a racist agenda as you can read in [their publications](https://anfenglish.com/kurdistan/refugees-settled-in-north-kurdistan-are-given-military-training-19978). so no, the answer isnt bending to their demands.</TEXT>

Cars with Arabic license plates driving around in Istanbul. So it's ok to have Arabic language where ever you look at, but not Kurdish who belongs to Anatolia as a language over a thousand years.

PKK will dissolve one way, and that is happening right now. as evident in reduction in the frequency of terror attacks since the government started its offensive.

ISIS smuggled oil into turkey just as oil smuggling happens every day in turkey-iraq and turkey-iran border. trying to draw this into some sort of turkey is supporting ISIS is the type of propaganda shilling we have come to expect. it is possible that PKK may always exist in some form or another. the point is their resurgence was because of AKP bringing them to the table. yes the same guy you guys want to show the whole world you are so against, is the same one who started peace process with pkk. meanwhile pkk brought in more weapons, setup bombs all over the country. that is what happens when you negotiate with terrorists. will they attack in the future? yes, but its becoming harder and harder for them to operate inside turkey, hence the reduction in the frequency of attacks.</TEXT>

Turks had no problem with assyrians initially, armenians were well armed and rebelled, assyrians were much weaker, and not very well armed, so they didnt rebel. Kurdish tribesmen were allied with turkish army, but ottomans didnt have much control over them, just armed them to the teath to fight against armenians. the turkish army itself did not commit many atrocities. it was a professional army, such things were punished strictly. it was primarily kurdish irregulars who committed most of the atrocities.</TEXT>

Turkish archives specifically point to these missionaries as source of weaponry for armenian terrorists. this is the same trick they pulled with the boxer rebellion in china. on top of it, the nations these missionary agents were from was at war with the ottomans, spreading wartime propaganda was part of their job description. people in todays world when they hear the word "missionary" they think of some grand and humanitarian individual. european missionaries of that age were at the forefront of imperialism and colonialism. they would go to essentially scout for supporters and intelligence in target nations in africa and asia that europeans had imperialist intentions on. inside the ottoman empire they subverted the armenians, armed them and caused mayhem and destruction.

    <TEXT>turkey needs the rebels to legitimize their presence in northern syria, similar to US needing YPG. especially with poisoned relations with syrian regime, turkey still does the next best thing, they repeatedly stated they dont want to have confrontations with syrian regime, and they are conducting OB in support of syria's territorial integrity. at this point as long as turkey and russia have an understanding, assad is not as important of a factor, and turkey can maintain its influence over FSA factions at the same time.</TEXT>
