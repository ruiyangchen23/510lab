    <TEXT>In Praise of Love- Alain Badiou "While desire focuses on the other, always in a somewhat fetishist manner, on particular objects, like breasts, buttocks and cock, love focuses on the very being of the other, on the other as it has erupted, fully armed with its being, into my life that is consequently disrupted and re-fashioned...A declaration of the  #8216;I love you #8217; kind seals the act of the encounter, is central and constitutes a commitment. But surrendering your body, taking your clothes off, being naked for the other, rehearsing those hallowed gestures, renouncing all embarrassment, shouting, all this involvement of the body is evidence of a surrender to love. It crucially distinguishes it from friendship. Friendship doesn #8217;t involve bodily contact, or any resonances in pleasure of the body. That #8217;s why it is a more intellectual attachment, and one that philosophers who are suspicious of passion have always preferred. Love, particularly over time, embraces all the positive aspects of friendship but love relates to the totality of the being of the other, and the surrender of the body becomes the material symbol of that totality. #8221;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>While I think that is a commonality I don't think that is the cause of their agreement. I think they have similar judicial philosophies that are most likely bred from a specific turn in analytical jurisprudence. (Read Kagan's essay from Oxford, despite disowning it for it's merits later on which was understandable it speaks to a specific legal pivot that came about in the 80s and early 90s. Alito and Roberts probably share the highest level of agreeability among the right side of the bench for a similar reason.)</TEXT>

Still pretty witty but not as satisfying as the others. 2nd) The pay off is totally worth it, after 15 episodes you will probably revel in the glory. You are right though, there is much less chance for the interplay to occur between characters.

    <TITLE>SCOTUS Monday- Two cases decided today. Hillman v. Maretta and Maryland v. King</TITLE>
    <DATE>2013-06-03 16:10:40</DATE>
    <TEXT>Update!: 1) Hillman v. Maretta- **Sotomayor writes, 9-0.** The Court rules that the VA statute at issue is preempted by the Federal Employees Group Life Insurance Act of 1954. http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/11-1221_7l48.pdf 2) Maryland v. King- **Kennedy writes. 5-4**, an unusual lineup: Scalia dissents, joined by Ginsburg, Sotomayor, and Kagan. Interesting side note...Scalia chose to read his dissent. An infrequent occurrence on the Court and usually withheld by Justices except in the strongest cases of dissent. Scalia was not a happy camper. The MD Court of Appeals is reversed. When officers make an arrest supported by probable cause for a serious offense and bring the suspect into the station, taking a cheek swab (and analyzing) is, like fingerprinting and photographing, a reasonable police procedure under the Fourth Amendment.

Eventually was persuaded that the suffering/environmental impact for the majority of seafood was negligible. As Singer would say, it's really about a capacity to be able to eat in such away. For individuals in developing nations or others even in developed nations that don't have cheap protein alternatives...they don't have the capacity so I see nothing immoral there.</TEXT>

[Check out this cool graph!](http://i.imgur.com/shvg02B.png) They just love to tease. **1) Oxford Health Plan v. Sutter- Kagan writing, 9-0** The Third Cirucuit is affirmed. The arbitrator's decision in this case survives the limited judicial review allowed by the Federal Arbitration Act. The Court says that it doesn't necessarily agree with this arbitrator's view that class action arbitration was permitted under the contract, but that's the arbitrator job not a court's. [Opinion](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-135_e1p3.pdf) **2) Peugh v. United States- Sotomayor writing, 5-4** The Ex Post Facto Clause is violated when a defendant is sentenced under guidelines promulgated after he committed his acts, and the new version of the guidelines provides for a higher sentence than the one in effect at the time he committed his act. Thomas, Roberts, Scalia, and Alito dissent. Thomas and Alito writing seperate dissents. [Opinion](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-62_5g68.pdf) **3) Horne v. Department of Agriculture- Thomas writing, 9-0** The Ninth Circuit is reversed; the Court rules that the Ninth Circuit HAS jurisdiction to decide the takings claim in this case. The Court does not decide that there was a Taking in the raisins case -- just that the plaintiff can pursue that claim.

    <TEXT>So in my humble opinion...there are 23 decisions left and the remaining big decisions could be argued to be: **1)Fisher v. UT-Austin- Affirmative Action** Whether this Court #8217;s decisions interpreting the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, including Grutter v. Bollinger, permit the University of Texas at Austin #8217;s use of race in undergraduate admissions decisions. (Kagan, J., recused) **2)Shelby County v. Holder- Voting Rights and Discrimination** Essentially, as one SCOTUS writer put it: "Shelby County will hinge on how the Justices answer the question Justice Elena Kagan asked toward the end of argument: who gets to decide when the problem of racial discrimination in voting is solved?" Whether Congress #8217; decision in 2006 to reauthorize Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act under the pre-existing coverage formula of Section 4(b) of the Voting Rights Act exceeded its authority under the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments and thus violated the Tenth Amendment and Article IV of the United States Constitution. **3)Hollingsworth v. Perry/Windsor v. United States- Marriage and equal protection** Perry: (1) Whether the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits the State of California from defining marriage as the union of a man and a woman; and (2) whether petitioners have standing under Article III,  #167; 2 of the Constitution in this case. Windsor: (1) Whether Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) violates the Fifth Amendment's guarantee of equal protection of the laws as applied to persons of the same sex who are legally married under the laws of their State; (2) whether the Executive Branch #8217;s agreement with the court below that DOMA is unconstitutional deprives this Court of jurisdiction to decide this case; and (3) whether the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group of the United States House of Representatives has Article III standing in this case. **4)AMP v. Myriad Genetics- Gene patents** Whether human genes are patentable. **5)Adoptive Couple v. Baby Girl- The Indian Child Welfare Act and adoption** (1) Whether a non-custodial parent can invoke the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 (ICWA), 25 U.S.C.  #167; #167; 1901-63, to block an adoption voluntarily and lawfully initiated by a non-Indian parent under state law; and (2) whether ICWA defines  #8220;parent #8221; in 25 U.S.C.  #167; 1903(9) to include an unwed biological father who has not complied with state law rules to attain legal status as a parent. **6)Salinas v. Texas- Miranda rights and Self-Incrimination** Whether or under what circumstances the Fifth Amendment #8217;s Self-Incrimination Clause protects a defendant #8217;s refusal to answer law enforcement questioning before he has been arrested or read his Miranda rights.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Honestly we don't know either. For sure there will be at least two opinions but that would be odd to set one whole day aside for that few. Most likely between 3-5 opinions delivered is my guess. We also don't know what opinions that will be delivered. It's honestly dependent on whether they are done. The fastest turn around has been three weeks since argued and the longest this term is still Fisher v. UT-Texas (Affirmative action) from back in October. We can make an educated guess they won't do Perry or Windsor (Marriage) until the last day and since Myriad (DNA/patents) occurred fairly recently it probably won't come down either. **Long answer short, 3-5 cases, maybe one or two big decisions that probably aren't the marriage or DNA/patent case but it's all speculation.**</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No there is not really a time limit. All of the opinions must be done before summer recess but there is never a problem with that because they can always add opinion days prior to that point if need be. The comment is more on the pace of decisions. For the 2012-2013 term the Court is at a 4-year low in pace of decisions. This lovely [graph](http://i.imgur.com/shvg02B.jpg) illustrates the situation. They are about 5 to 9 below the average if not more according to some. With two weeks left the court is usually at around 10-15. This is not necessarily a bad thing. Opinions are given when they are done, the judges never should feel rushed and have as much time as they need to write. Perfect example is from October. Fisher v. UT Austin has taken over 8 months to write (Really hard case on affirmative action most likely being written by Kennedy). Some rare cases on the other side of the extreme have had a 3/4 week turn around (usually pretty easy.)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes. You are definitely right in that sense. The only other alternative is that the court could request a case be re-argued as was the circumstance in Citizens United v. FEC. That's EXTREMELY* rare and requires a lot more outstanding circumstances.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>SCOTUS Thursday! (DNA CASE!)- American Trucking v. LA. (9-0), Tarrant Regional Water Dist. V. Herrmann. (9-0), US v. Davila (remanded), AMP v. Myriad (9-0).</TITLE>
    <DATE>2013-06-13 16:25:54</DATE>
    <TEXT>/r/SCOTUS is calling for [you](http://i.imgur.com/50kXuaj.png). ------- **1) AMP v. Myriad (Thomas writes, 9-0)** *The Court holds that natural isolated DNA is not patentable. Synthetic DNA is patentable.* *The synthetic DNA (cDNA) is patent eligible because it is not naturally occurring.* From the opinion: "Myriad #8217;s DNA claim falls within the law of nature exception. Myriad #8217;s principal contribution was uncovering the precise location and genetic sequence of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. Diamond v. Chakrabarty, 447 U. S. 303, is central to the patent-eligibility inquiry whether such action was new  #8220;with markedly different characteristics from any found in nature, #8221; id., at 310. Myriad did not create or alter either the genetic information encoded in the BCRA1 and BCRA2 genes or the genetic structure of the DNA. It found an important and useful gene, but groundbreaking, innovative, or even brilliant discovery does not by itself satisfy the  #167;101 inquiry." [Opinion](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-398_8njq.pdf) ------ **2) Tarrant Regional Water Dist. V. Herrmann. (Sotomayor writes, 9-0)** (1) Whether Congress #8217;s approval of an interstate water compact that grants the contracting states  #8220;equal rights #8221; to certain surface water and  #8211; using language present in almost all such compacts #8212; provides that the compact shall not  #8220;be deemed . . . to interfere #8221; with each state #8217;s  #8220;appropriation, use, and control of water . . . not inconsistent with its obligations under this Compact, #8221; manifests unmistakably clear congressional consent to state laws that expressly burden interstate commerce in water; and (2) whether a provision of a congressionally approved multi-state compact that is designed to ensure an equal share of water among the contracting states preempts protectionist state laws that obstruct other states from accessing the water to which they are entitled by the compact. *The Court rules that the compact does not preempt the state water laws of Oklahoma. This involves an interpretation of the Red River Compact.* *The Tenth Circuit is affirmed.* [Opinion](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/11-889_5ie6.pdf) ------ **3) US v. Davila (Ginsburg writes, vacated and remanded)** This was a case in which the issue was whether there must be an automatic reversal if the judge played any role in the plea bargaining. Whether the court of appeals erred in holding that any degree of judicial participation in plea negotiations, in violation of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(c)(1), automatically requires vacatur of a defendant #8217;s guilty plea, irrespective of whether the error prejudiced the defendant. *Under the Federal Rules, vacatur of the plea is not in order if the record shows no prejudice to Davila's decision to plead guilty.* *"Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11 prohibits judges from participating in plea agreements, but another subsection of the rule also provides that a 'variance from the requirements' of Rule 11 is 'harmless if it does not affect substantial rights,' so this one did not come as a huge surprise."- Amy Howe* *The decision of the Eleventh Circuit is vacated and remanded.* [Opinion](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-167_d1oe.pdf) ----- **4) American Trucking v. LA. (Kagan writes, 9-0)** Whether 49 U.S.C.  #167; 14501(c)(1), which provides that  #8220;a State [or] political subdivision . . . may not enact or enforce a law, regulation, or other provision having the force and effect of law related to a price, route, or service of any motor carrier . . . with respect to the transportation of property, #8221; contains an unexpressed  #8220;market participant #8221; exception and permits a municipal governmental entity to take action that conflicts with the express preemption clause, occurs in a market in which the municipal entity does not participate, and is unconnected with any interest in the efficient procurement of services. *The Court holds that federal law expressly preempts the agreement- two provisions dealing with displays by trucks in the port with regards to placards and parking.* *Ninth circuit is reversed.* [Opinion](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/11-798_anbf.pdf) -----</TEXT>

You can make educated guesses which rely on time since argued and how difficult the case is. The marriage cases will most likely come down the last day at the court due to how close it is.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>All we have is the Supreme Court calendar which states the last two remaining days for opinions are the 17th and the 24th. As we know from last year though they could potentially add opinions day all the way up until recess which I believe is July 1st. Last year the last opinion (Healthcare) came down on the 28th rather the 25th because they added another day. They have to add opinion days at this point so we could have the same situation from last year. Perry/Windsor come down on the 27th.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Can we talk about Scalia's concurrence in AMP v. Myriad Genetics? It's obviously quite odd and out of place for some.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2013-06-14 21:44:57</DATE>
    <TEXT>"JUSTICE SCALIA, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment. I join the judgment of the Court, and all of its opinion except Part I #8211;A and some portions of the rest of the opinion going into fine details of molecular biology. I am unable to affirm those details on my own knowledge or even my own belief. It suffices for me to affirm, having studied the opinions below and the expert briefs presented here, that the portion of DNA isolated from its natural state sought to be patented is identical to that portion of the DNA in its natural state; and that complementary DNA (cDNA) is a synthetic creation not normally present in nature." http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-398_8njq.pdf ---- So a couple of stray observations. 1) The Court had trouble with the topic obviously. During oral arguments several times there were misconceptions that counsel had to clear up but were understandable. Some of these debates aren't even resolved among geneticists. This is why they so heavily depended on the briefs from scientists in this case which also leads me to believe Thomas probably was double checking everything he wrote with some second opinion to make sure his biology was right. 2) Some are writing that Scalia didn't understand the science and wanted to provide that disclaimer. I don't think that is entirely the issue at hand. Scalia wrote the concurrence because further developments in science or the gray area that is still being contested could later suggest the facts that the court was using were wrong or not complete at the time. On the reverse as well, the science could later confirm without a doubt they were right. I honestly believe Scalia is suggesting: Look if science eventually discovers that our conclusions on DNA or cDNA are wrong or slightly different, understand that we were using what was available to us. 3) Scalia on several occasions had suggested the greatest difficulty before the modern court is the advent and pace of new technologies.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>/r/scotus is calling for [you](http://i.imgur.com/0xsCasB.jpg). Bring the popcorn for next week because affirmative action, ICWA, voting rights, and marriage are at stake! ------ **1) Descamps v. US (Kagan writes, 8-1)** Issue: Whether, in a case under the Armed Career Criminal Act, when a state crime does not require an element of the federal crime of burglary, the federal court may find the existence of that element by examining the record of the state proceedings under the "modified categorical approach." Decision summary: *The modified categorical approach does not apply to statutes that contain a single indivisible set of elements. "In Plain English, it is now harder for the government to use the facts of a prior conviction to enhance a federal criminal sentence."* [Opinion](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/11-9540_8m58.pdf) 9th Circuit reversed. Justice Alito dissents. ----- **2) AmEx v. Italian Colors (Scalia writes, 5-3)** Issue: Whether the Federal Arbitration Act permits courts, invoking the  #8220;federal substantive law of arbitrability, #8221; to invalidate arbitration agreements on the ground that they do not permit class arbitration of a federal-law claim. Decision summary: *The FAA does not permit courts to invalidate a contractual waiver of class arbitration on the ground that the plaintiff #8217;s cost of individually arbitrating a federal statutory claim exceeds the potential recovery. "In Plain English, this means that if you have a contract with a business in which you agree to arbitrate a dispute but it says you can't get together with other plaintiffs in a "class action," that contract will be enforced, even if it may be too expensive for you to pursue your own claim given what you might win."* [Opinion](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-133_19m1.pdf) 2nd Circuit reversed. Ginsburg, Breyer, Kagan dissent. Sotomayor recused. ------ **3) AID v. AFOSI (CJ Roberts writes, 6-2)** Issue: Whether the United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003, 22 U.S.C.  #167; 7631(f), which requires an organization to have a policy explicitly opposing prostitution and sex trafficking in order to receive federal funding to provide HIV and AIDS programs overseas, violates the First Amendment. Decision Summary: *The Court holds that the policy violates the First Amendment by compelling affirmation of a belief outside the scope of the program. The Policy Requirement violates the First Amendment by compelling as a condition of federal funding the affirmation of a belief that by its nature cannot be confined within the scope of the Government program.* [Opinion](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-10_21p3.pdf) 2nd Circuit affirmed. Scalia and Thomas dissent. Kagan recused. ----- **Informed Speculation**: - We can now confidently speculate that Shelby County v. Holder will be written by Roberts. This is due to Scalia writing the AmEx decision today. This favors the plaintiffs in Shelby County. - We can now confidently speculate that Koontz v. St. Johns River will be written by Alito. This is due to Kagan writing the Descamps decision today. No consensus on what this means for the decision. - We can confidently speculate that Alito will write the opinion in Vance v. Ball State.

    <TEXT>Get to /r/scotus before the [tidal wave](http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/cartoonists/120409_cn-supreme-supreme-court_p465.jpg) this week! ----- **Vance v. Ball State** * *Facts of the Case:* Maetta Vance began working for University Dining Services at Ball State University in 1989 as a substitute server. She was the only African-American working in the department. Vance submitted a complaint to the University when a coworker used a racial epithet directed at her and African-American students at the University. The University issued the coworker a written warning, but following a series of incidents that resulted in Vance reporting that she felt unsafe in her workplace, the University investigated but found no basis for action. In 2006, Vance sued Ball State University in federal district court for lessening her work duties and ability to work overtime, forcing her to work through her breaks, and unjustly disciplining her. After filing the suit, Vance claimed her work environment continued to worsen, but the University #8217;s investigations did not yield enough evidence to discipline anyone. The University moved for summary judgment. The district court granted the motion and held that there was not enough evidence to prove a hostile work environment and that the University was not liable for the actions of individual coworkers. Vance appealed, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed the judgment of the lower court * *Question:* Can a coworker who is vested with the authority to oversee the daily work of another worker be considered a supervisor for the purpose of determining employer liability for harassment? [Oral Argument](http://www.oyez.org/cases/2010-2019/2012/2012_11_556) * *Quick Analysis on Oral Argument/Possible Outcome:* A substantial amount of time in oral argument was spent dealing with the subject of the record and the actual facts in the case. This troubled some justices especially Scalia. Substantial time was also spent in oral argument comparing/contrasting Vance to a previous case on employment law. This case was [Faragher v. City of Boca Raton](http://www.oyez.org/cases/1990-1999/1997/1997_97_282). In a very messy and quick summary a supervising lifeguard was using his position of power and authority to hedge and harass a lower employee. In this case threatening/making her clean toilets unless she 'dated' him. the Court held that an employer is vicariously liable under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 for actionable discrimination caused by a supervisor. The Court also held that such liability is subject to an affirmative defense looking to the reasonableness of the employer's conduct as well as that of the plaintiff victim. "The City had entirely failed to disseminate its policy against sexual harassment among the beach employees and that its officials made no attempt to keep track of the conduct of supervisors like [Faragher's]," wrote Justice Souter, "[u]nder such circumstances, we hold as a matter of law that the City could not be found to have exercised reasonable care to prevent the supervisors' harassing conduct." The comparison to this case is a little difficult for Vance. First, because in Faragher the supervisor role was readily explicit. In the case of Vance it was not. The Justices debated the record and even semantic interpretations of what it meant to be supervisor. Is the role of a supervisor dependent on the ability to affect the day to day work of said employee? Here are a couple of hypotheticals that the Justices spent some time on. A messy paraphrasing of CJ Roberts hypothetical in oral arguments: Let's say an employee can control the music in work environment and uses your distain of country in some hegemonic manner? Should the court hold the employer and thus employee supervisor liable in that case? Also is that person a supervisor because he effects the day to day of your work environment? Breyer had an alternative hypothetical. The court might decide very narrowly. Ball State will not likely not be seen liable for a worker who really had no supervisory role practically or semantically over Vance. *After Thoughts* * At one point Alito uses the same Roberts music reference but adds Wagner as potential music to abuse employees. Not 100% on this but I am fairly confident you can hear Scalia roaring with laughter at the thought in oral argument. * Justice Scalia and Thomas dissented in the original Faragher v. City Boca Raton. Justice Kennedy, Breyer, and Ginsburg did join the majority and remain. * Despite Kennedy remaining it seems he might have wavered this time. Alito has not written an opinion in December. He is likely the author in this case. This would not bode well for Vance. My prediction is 5-4 split in favor of the respondent. ----- **Adoptive Couple v. Baby Girl** * *Facts of the Case:* When the biological mother of Baby Girl became pregnant she did not live with the father and the father did not support the mother financially. The mother sent the father a text message asking if he would rather pay child support or relinquish his parental rights. He sent a text back, saying that he would relinquish his rights, though he later testified that he thought he was relinquishing his rights only to the mother. The biological father was a registered member of the Cherokee Nation. The biological mother attempted to verify this status, but spelled the father #8217;s name wrong and misrepresented his birthday in the request, so the Nation could not locate the father #8217;s registration. The mother listed Baby Girl #8217;s ethnicity as  #8220;Hispanic #8221; instead of  #8220;Native American #8221; on the birth certificate. The mother decided to put Baby Girl up for adoption because she had two other children that she struggled to support. Adoptive Couple, who resided in South Carolina, began adoption proceedings in that state. The Cherokee Nation finally identified the father as a registered member and filed a notice of intervention, stating that Baby Girl was an  #8220;Indian Child #8221; under the Federal Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA). The father stated that he did not consent to the adoption and would seek custody of Baby Girl. After trial, the family court denied Adoptive Couple #8217;s petition for adoption and granted custody to the biological father. The court held that the biological father was a  #8220;parent #8221; under the ICWA because of his paternity and pursuit of custody as soon as he learned that Baby Girl was being put up for adoption. Adoptive Couple did not follow the procedural directives in the ICWA to obtain the father #8217;s consent prior to initiating adoption proceedings. The Supreme Court of South Carolina affirmed. * *Question:* Can a non-custodial parent invoke ICWA to block an adoption voluntarily and lawfully initiated by a non-Indian parent under state law? Does ICWA define  #8220;parent #8221; to include an unwed biological father who has not complied with state law rules to attain legal status as a parent? [Oral Argument](http://www.oyez.org/cases/2010-2019/2012/2012_12_399) * *Quick Analysis on Oral Argument/Possible Outcome*: So this case is definitely more tricky. The Justices spent a lot of time on the ways of interpreting Congress's original intent in the statute. For example, Lisa Blatt, the lawyer for the petitioner, describes how the original law itself is being perverted beyond its original and beneficial intent. Interestingly, some of the Justices went out of their way to discuss if the ICWA was still relevant. It seems a bit out of scope of the case at hand. Another interesting but maybe legally tangential point of contention concerned the Cherokee status of the baby girl and biological father. The Cherokee nation do not require "Blood Quantums" (or certain percentages) to be declared Cherokee. Rather, an individual has to prove a single ancestor from an official list to be considered Cherokee. The father in the case is less than 4% Cherokee and the daughter less than 2%. Alito and CJ Roberts had some trouble with the use of ICWA due the blood quantum dilemma. *After Thoughts* * In an an [interview](http://www.bloomberg.com/video/u-s-supreme-court-justice-scalia-on-reading-law-BPCeR1adQeCiaqtvCSLdGA.html) with Charlie Rose, Scalia commented that the hardest decision that he may have ever made was a very similar case to this one in the 1980s. He had to return a adopted boy from his well-off parents to his biological parents due to ICWA provisions. The boy had lived with his adoptive parents for years. * CJ Roberts has two children, both adopted. * Lisa Blatt is one of my favorite oral advocates on the Supreme Court. Sometimes there is a lot of rhetorical flourish but her rebuttal in this case cannot be missed: "And I want you to keep in mind about this case, is your decision is going to apply to the next case and to a apartment in New York City where a tribal member impregnates someone who's African-American or Jewish or Asian Indian, and in that view, even though the father is a completely absentee father, you are rendering these women second-class citizens with inferior rights to direct their reproductive rights and their -- who raises their child. You are relegating adopted parents to go to the back of the bus and wait in line if they can adopt. And you're basically relegating the child, the child to a piece of property with a sign that says,"Indian, keep off." "Do not disturb." This case is going to affect any interracial adoption of children. * Radiolab did a [great piece](http://www.radiolab.org/blogs/radiolab-blog/2013/may/30/adoptive-couple-v-baby-girl/) on the case and met the "Baby Girl." * Edit: /u/borkborkbork has some insightful and astute clarifications that were not made perfectly clear before. Also who doesn't love that username? I think every judicial nominee mutters that in their sleep. "A few clarifications about the facts in the "Adoptive Couple" case, because the summary above makes the actions of both birth parents seem different from what they actually were: The text message conversation: Father testified that he did intend to relinquish his rights to the child, but he testified that his relinquishment was based on his assumption that the birth mother would raise the child. The mother spelled the father's name wrong because the father himself uses multiple spellings of his own name on various legal documents, and she guessed incorrectly as to which spelling he had used in his tribal registration. (Dustin/Dusten/Dustan). The baby, while within the legal definition of "Native American", is 3/256 Cherokee. The father is not much more than that. The mother is Hispanic. It's an interesting case, because the father had no apparent interest in playing any part in the child's life, or of having the child raised by a Native American, until he discovered that the mother was putting the child up for adoption. Had he been any ethnicity other than Native American, he wouldn't have made it past 12b6." ----- **UTSW v. Nassar** * *Facts of the Case:* Dr. Naiel Nassar, who is of Middle Eastern descent, was hired by the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center (UTSW) in 1995 to work at the Amelia Court Clinic (Clinic), which specializes in HIV/AIDS treatment. After three years there, he left to pursue additional training and returned in 2001 as an Assistant Professor of Internal Medicine and Infectious Diseases and Associate Medical Director of the Clinic. His immediate supervisor at the Clinic was Dr. Philip Keiser, whose supervisor at UTSW was Dr. Beth Levine. After being hired in 2004, Levine immediately began inquiring into Nassar #8217;s productivity and billing practices. In 2005, after interviewing a candidate who was of Middle Eastern descent, Levine stated in Nassar #8217;s presence,  #8220;Middle Easterners are lazy. #8221; In 2006, after hiring the candidate, Levine made a similar statement in Keiser #8217;s presence. Keiser informed Nassar of these comments as well as the fact that Levine scrutinized Nassar #8217;s productivity more than any other doctor. Around this time, Nassar applied for a promotion that Levine actively undermined. In 2006, Nassar resigned from the UTSW faculty and cited Levine #8217;s harassment and the creation of an unhealthy work environment in his resignation letter. Nassar resigned with the understanding that he would be offered a position at the Amelia Court Clinic unaffiliated with the UTSW, but the Clinic was forced to withdraw its offer after heavy opposition from the UTSW faculty, who have an agreement with the Clinic regarding positions to be filled by faculty doctors. In 2008, Nassar sued UTSW under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and argued that UTSW had constructively discharged and retaliated against him. The jury found in favor of Nassar and awarded him back pay and compensatory damages. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part, holding that there was sufficient evidence to support the retaliation claim but insufficient evidence to support the claim of constructive discharge. * *Question:* Does the retaliation provision of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 require a plaintiff to prove that an employer would not have taken an action but for the existence of an improper motive, or does the provision require only proof that the employer had mixed motives for taking an action? [Oral Argument.](http://www.oyez.org/cases/2010-2019/2012/2012_12_484) Due to length constraints I will recommend checking out this [post](http://www.concurringopinions.com/archives/2013/06/sole-motives-and-university-of-texas-southwestern-medical-center-v-nassar.html) on the subject. Eyer believes this might be one of the most important civil rights cases this year along Shelby. What does the role of mixed motives play in employee discrimination? No act has a single motivator and the Court is divided. ---- Thanks to [Oyez](http://www.oyez.org/) for the help</TEXT>

    <TITLE>While everyone is awaiting the 'Big Four' (Perry, Windsor, Fisher, Shelby) let's take a look at some other important cases that remain: Vance v. Ball State, Adoptive Couple v. Baby Girl, and UTSW v. Nassar.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2013-06-23 23:15:00</DATE>
    <TEXT>**Vance v. Ball State** * *Facts of the Case:* Maetta Vance began working for University Dining Services at Ball State University in 1989 as a substitute server. She was the only African-American working in the department. Vance submitted a complaint to the University when a coworker used a racial epithet directed at her and African-American students at the University. The University issued the coworker a written warning, but following a series of incidents that resulted in Vance reporting that she felt unsafe in her workplace, the University investigated but found no basis for action. In 2006, Vance sued Ball State University in federal district court for lessening her work duties and ability to work overtime, forcing her to work through her breaks, and unjustly disciplining her. After filing the suit, Vance claimed her work environment continued to worsen, but the University #8217;s investigations did not yield enough evidence to discipline anyone. The University moved for summary judgment. The district court granted the motion and held that there was not enough evidence to prove a hostile work environment and that the University was not liable for the actions of individual coworkers. Vance appealed, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed the judgment of the lower court * *Question:* Can a coworker who is vested with the authority to oversee the daily work of another worker be considered a supervisor for the purpose of determining employer liability for harassment? [Oral Argument](http://www.oyez.org/cases/2010-2019/2012/2012_11_556) * *Quick Analysis on Oral Argument/Possible Outcome:* A substantial amount of time in oral argument was spent dealing with the subject of the record and the actual facts in the case. This troubled some justices especially Scalia. Substantial time was also spent in oral argument comparing/contrasting Vance to a previous case on employment law. This case was [Faragher v. City of Boca Raton](http://www.oyez.org/cases/1990-1999/1997/1997_97_282). In a very messy and quick summary a supervising lifeguard was using his position of power and authority to hedge and harass a lower employee. In this case threatening/making her clean toilets unless she 'dated' him. the Court held that an employer is vicariously liable under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 for actionable discrimination caused by a supervisor. The Court also held that such liability is subject to an affirmative defense looking to the reasonableness of the employer's conduct as well as that of the plaintiff victim. "The City had entirely failed to disseminate its policy against sexual harassment among the beach employees and that its officials made no attempt to keep track of the conduct of supervisors like [Faragher's]," wrote Justice Souter, "[u]nder such circumstances, we hold as a matter of law that the City could not be found to have exercised reasonable care to prevent the supervisors' harassing conduct." The comparison to this case is a little difficult for Vance. First, because in Faragher the supervisor role was readily explicit. In the case of Vance it was not. The Justices debated the record and even semantic interpretations of what it meant to be supervisor. Is the role of a supervisor dependent on the ability to affect the day to day work of said employee? Here are a couple of hypotheticals that the Justices spent some time on. A messy paraphrasing of CJ Roberts hypothetical in oral arguments: Let's say an employee can control the music in work environment and uses your distain of country in some hegemonic manner? Should the court hold the employer and thus employee supervisor liable in that case? Also is that person a supervisor because he effects the day to day of your work environment? Breyer had an alternative hypothetical. The court might decide very narrowly. Ball State will not likely not be seen liable for a worker who really had no supervisory role practically or semantically over Vance. *After Thoughts* * At one point Alito uses the same Roberts music reference but adds Wagner as potential music to abuse employees. Not 100% on this but I am fairly confident you can hear Scalia roaring with laughter at the thought in oral argument. * Justice Scalia and Thomas dissented in the original Faragher v. City Boca Raton. Justice Kennedy, Breyer, and Ginsburg did join the majority and remain. * Despite Kennedy remaining it seems he might have wavered this time. Alito has not written an opinion in December. He is likely the author in this case. This would not bode well for Vance. My prediction is 5-4 split in favor of the respondent. ----- **Adoptive Couple v. Baby Girl** * *Facts of the Case:* When the biological mother of Baby Girl became pregnant she did not live with the father and the father did not support the mother financially. The mother sent the father a text message asking if he would rather pay child support or relinquish his parental rights. He sent a text back, saying that he would relinquish his rights, though he later testified that he thought he was relinquishing his rights only to the mother. The biological father was a registered member of the Cherokee Nation. The biological mother attempted to verify this status, but spelled the father #8217;s name wrong and misrepresented his birthday in the request, so the Nation could not locate the father #8217;s registration. The mother listed Baby Girl #8217;s ethnicity as  #8220;Hispanic #8221; instead of  #8220;Native American #8221; on the birth certificate. The mother decided to put Baby Girl up for adoption because she had two other children that she struggled to support. Adoptive Couple, who resided in South Carolina, began adoption proceedings in that state. The Cherokee Nation finally identified the father as a registered member and filed a notice of intervention, stating that Baby Girl was an  #8220;Indian Child #8221; under the Federal Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA). The father stated that he did not consent to the adoption and would seek custody of Baby Girl. After trial, the family court denied Adoptive Couple #8217;s petition for adoption and granted custody to the biological father. The court held that the biological father was a  #8220;parent #8221; under the ICWA because of his paternity and pursuit of custody as soon as he learned that Baby Girl was being put up for adoption. Adoptive Couple did not follow the procedural directives in the ICWA to obtain the father #8217;s consent prior to initiating adoption proceedings. The Supreme Court of South Carolina affirmed. * *Question:* Can a non-custodial parent invoke ICWA to block an adoption voluntarily and lawfully initiated by a non-Indian parent under state law? Does ICWA define  #8220;parent #8221; to include an unwed biological father who has not complied with state law rules to attain legal status as a parent? [Oral Argument](http://www.oyez.org/cases/2010-2019/2012/2012_12_399) * *Quick Analysis on Oral Argument/Possible Outcome*: So this case is definitely more tricky. The Justices spent a lot of time on the ways of interpreting Congress's original intent in the statute. For example, Lisa Blatt, the lawyer for the petitioner, describes how the original law itself is being perverted beyond its original and beneficial intent. Interestingly, some of the Justices went out of their way to discuss if the ICWA was still relevant. It seems a bit out of scope of the case at hand. Another interesting but maybe legally tangential point of contention concerned the Cherokee status of the baby girl and biological father. The Cherokee nation do not require "Blood Quantums" (or certain percentages) to be declared Cherokee. Rather, an individual has to prove a single ancestor from an official list to be considered Cherokee. The father in the case is less than 4% Cherokee and the daughter less than 2%. Alito and CJ Roberts had some trouble with the use of ICWA due the blood quantum dilemma. *After Thoughts* * In an an [interview](http://www.bloomberg.com/video/u-s-supreme-court-justice-scalia-on-reading-law-BPCeR1adQeCiaqtvCSLdGA.html) with Charlie Rose, Scalia commented that the hardest decision that he may have ever made was a very similar case to this one in the 1980s. He had to return a adopted boy from his well-off parents to his biological parents due to ICWA provisions. The boy had lived with his adoptive parents for years. * CJ Roberts has two children, both adopted. * Lisa Blatt is one of my favorite oral advocates on the Supreme Court. Sometimes there is a lot of rhetorical flourish but her rebuttal in this case cannot be missed: "And I want you to keep in mind about this case, is your decision is going to apply to the next case and to a apartment in New York City where a tribal member impregnates someone who's African-American or Jewish or Asian Indian, and in that view, even though the father is a completely absentee father, you are rendering these women second-class citizens with inferior rights to direct their reproductive rights and their -- who raises their child. You are relegating adopted parents to go to the back of the bus and wait in line if they can adopt. And you're basically relegating the child, the child to a piece of property with a sign that says,"Indian, keep off." "Do not disturb." This case is going to affect any interracial adoption of children. * Radiolab did a [great piece](http://www.radiolab.org/blogs/radiolab-blog/2013/may/30/adoptive-couple-v-baby-girl/) on the case and met the "Baby Girl." ----- **UTSW v. Nassar** * *Facts of the Case:* Dr. Naiel Nassar, who is of Middle Eastern descent, was hired by the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center (UTSW) in 1995 to work at the Amelia Court Clinic (Clinic), which specializes in HIV/AIDS treatment.

    <TEXT>Sorry I definitely did not make this clear. The incidences occurred over a 10+ year period from 1989 until around 2003/04/05. I will have to double check but I am fairly confident there were only a few years between the time Vance quit and when she filed her lawsuit. Also interesting side note...in every instance of an incident there was in fact a formal investigation by Ball State. Not one of the investigation lead to formal firings or repercussions for the alleged abusers though.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>SCOTUS Monday Thread!- 11 cases remain including the Big Four.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2013-06-24 15:29:29</DATE>
    <TEXT>**The Court has announced that they will be back at 10am tomorrow** * When the dust settles after this week you will need your SCOTUS fix for the summer somehow.../r/scotus is a great remedy. * 9:30am EST there will be orders in petitions and at 10am EST we will have opinions. ---------- **Important Petitions** For those of you who follow petition orders today was a big day for one particular case: recess appointments! "NLRB V. NOEL CANNING, ET AL. -The petition for a writ of certiorari is granted. In addition to the questions presented by the petition, the parties are directed to brief and argue the following question: Whether the President's recess-appointment power may be exercised when the Senate is convening every three days in pro forma sessions." Should be a fun case to watch next year. ---- **Opinions-** **Vance v. Ball State (Alito writes, 5-4)** *Issue:* Whether the  #8220;supervisor #8221; liability rule established by Faragher v. City of Boca Raton and Burlington Industries, Inc. v. Ellerth (i) applies to harassment by those whom the employer vests with authority to direct and oversee their victim #8217;s daily work, or (ii) is limited to those harassers who have the power to  #8220;hire, fire, demote, promote, transfer, or discipline #8221; their victim. *Opinion Summary:* The Court holds that an employer is a supervisor for vicarious liabilty under Title VII only if she has the power given by the employer to take tangible employment actions against the victim. " In Vance, the Court rejects the EEOC interpretation of who counts as a supervisor. In Vance, the Court defines 'tangible employment action' to include actions that have a 'significant change in employment status, such as hiring, firing, failing to promote, reassignment with significantly different responsibilities, or a decision causing a significant change in benefits.' " [Opinion](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/11-556_11o2.pdf) * The Seventh Circuit is affirmed. * Justice Ginsburg writes the dissent with Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan joining. * Supreme Court veteran Lyle Denniston has [pre-opinion analysis](http://www.scotusblog.com/?p=155622) over at SCOTUSblog. * Check out a thread from yesterday with more [info](http://www.reddit.com/r/law/comments/1gxfed/while_most_of_the_country_is_awaiting_the_big/) ----- **Mutual v. Bartlett (Alito writes,5-4 )** *Issue*: Whether the First Circuit Court of Appeals erred when it created a circuit split and held  #8211; in clear conflict with this Court #8217;s decisions in PLIVA v. Mensing, Riegel v. Medtronic, and Cipollone v. Liggett Group  #8211; that federal law does not preempt state law design-defect claims targeting generic pharmaceutical products because the conceded conflict between such claims and the federal laws governing generic pharmaceutical design allegedly can be avoided if the makers of generic pharmaceuticals simply stop making their products. *Opinion Summary:* The Court holds that design defect claims under state law that turn on the adequacy of a drug's warnings are preempted by federal law under PLIVA. [Opinion](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-142_8njq.pdf) * First Circuit Reversed * Justice Breyer dissents joined with Kagan and Sotomayor dissents joined by Ginsburg. ----- **U.S. v. Kebodoeux (Breyer writes, 7-2)** *Issue:* (1) Whether the court of appeals erred in conducting its constitutional analysis on the premise that respondent was not under a federal registration obligation until the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA) was enacted, when pre-SORNA federal law obligated him to register as a sex offender; and (2) whether the court of appeals erred in holding that Congress lacks the Article I authority to provide for criminal penalties under 18 U.S.C.  #167; 2250(a)(2)(A), as applied to a person who was convicted of a sex offense under federal law and completed his criminal sentence before SORNA was enacted. *Opinion Summary*: Registration requirement under SORNA as applied to Kebodeaux falls within the scope of Congress's authority under the Necessary and Proper Clause. *Opinion Summary Furthered:* Mike Gottlieb: "United States v. Kebodeaux is a case about the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SONRA), which requires federal sex offenders to register in the States where they live. Defendant was convicted of a sex offense, but had already served his sentence and been discharged when SONRA was enacted. The question in the case was whether Congress had the power to enact SONRA's registration requirements and apply them to an offender who had already completed his sentence when SONRA was enacted. The Court holds that Congress had that power under the Necessary and Proper Clause. The Court's opinion in Kebodeaux turns in significant part on the fact that the defendant was still subject to registration requirements under the federal Wetterling Act when he was released. As a result, the registration requirements of SONRA merely modified existing legal requirements. 'Congress could reasonably conclude that registration requirements applied to federal sex offenders after their release can help protect the public from those federal sex offenders and alleviate public safety concerns.' " [Opinion](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-418_7k8b.pdf) * The Fifth Circuit is reversed and remanded. * Justice Scalia and Thomas dissent. ---- **Fisher v. UT-Austin (Kennedy writes, 7-1)** *The decision is fairly narrow, Justice Thomas writes in his concurring opinion he would have overturned the landmark affirmative action case Grutter.* *Issue:* Whether this Court #8217;s decisions interpreting the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, including Grutter v. Bollinger, permit the University of Texas at Austin #8217;s use of race in undergraduate admissions decisions. *Opinion Summary:* Because the Fifth Circuit did not hold the university to the demanding burden of strict scrutiny articulated in Grutter and Bakke, its decision afffiming the district court's grant of summary judgment was incorrect. From Kennedy: "Strict scrutiny does not permit a court to accept a school #8217;s assertion that its admissions process uses race in a permissible way without closely examining how the process works in practice, yet that is what the District Court and Fifth Circuit did here. The Court vacates the Fifth Circuit #8217;s judgment. But fairness to the litigants and the courts that heard the case requires that it be remanded so that the admissions process can be considered and judged under a correct analysis. In determining whether summary judgment in the University #8217;s favor was appropriate, the Fifth Circuit must assess whether the University has offered sufficient evidence to prove that its admissions program is narrowly tailored to obtain the educational benefits of diversity." Amy Howe: "Justice Scalia's concurrence is very brief. He says because the petitioner did not ask the Court to overrule Grutter, he joins the opinion of the Court in full. The majority seems to reaffirm that diversity is a compelling interest if only because that rule was not challenged by the plaintiffs in the case." [Opinion](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/11-345_l5gm.pdf) * Fifth Circuit is vacated and remanded. * Justice Ginsburg dissents alone. Kagan was recused. * Eugene Volokh asks the big question of the day: "Given that the Court issued a rather plain vanilla 7-1 ruling remanding the case to the Fifth Circuit to apply strict scrutiny, why did it take nine months to issue the opinion?" Some back and forth obviously occurred between the justices." * The NYT has their [analysis/blog](http://projects.nytimes.com/live-dashboard/2013-06-supreme-court-decisions?smid=fb-nytimes amp;WT.z_sma=US_LAO_20130624) up on the decision. * Ilya Somin has some analysis on the decision over at [the Volokh blog](http://www.volokh.com/2013/06/24/preliminary-thoughts-on-fisher-v-university-of-texas/). ----- **UTSW v. Nassar (Kennedy writes, 5-4)** *Issue:* Whether the retaliation provision of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C.  #167; 2000e-3(a), and similarly worded statutes require a plaintiff to prove but-for causation (i.e., that an employer would not have taken an adverse employment action but for an improper motive), or instead require only proof that the employer had a mixed motive (i.e., that an improper motive was one of multiple reasons for the employment action). *Opinion Summary*: The Court holds that Title VII retaliation claims must be proved according to traditional principles of "but for" causation, not the lesser causation standards stated in the law. Kevin Russell: "The question in Nassar was whether a provision of Title VII that permits a plaintiff to win by showing that discrimination was a "motivating factor" in an employment decision, also applies to claims of retaliation. The Court holds that it does not, so the plaintiff has to meet the higher burden of proving that the employer would not have taken the challenged action (say, termination) if the employee had not filed an EEOC complaint." [Opinion](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-484_o759.pdf ) * Fifth Circuit is vacated and remanded. * Justice Ginsburg dissents joined by Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan. * From Ginsburg's dissent: "Indeed, the Court appears driven by a zeal to reduce the number of retaliation claims filed against employers. Congress had no such goal in mind when it added the provision at issue in the case." * Check out a thread from yesterday with more [info](http://www.reddit.com/r/law/comments/1gxfed/while_most_of_the_country_is_awaiting_the_big/) ----- Pro-employer day at the Supreme Court, at least according to Ginsburg. * Kevin Russell: "In both of her dissents, in Vance and Nassar, Justice Ginsburg calls on Congress to overturn the Court's decision." * Justice Ginsburg's bench statement says of Vance and Nassar that "Both decisions dilute the strength of Title VII in ways Congress could not have intended...Today, the ball again lies in Congress' court to correct this Court's wayward interpretations of Title VII." ---- Thanks to SCOTUSblog and Oyez for the help and analysis today.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>SCOTUS Monday- Vance v. Ball State (5-4), Mutual v. Bartlett, U.S. v. Kebodoeux (7-2), Fisher v. UT-Austin (7-1)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2013-06-24 17:00:45</DATE>
    <TEXT>**The Court has announced that they will be back at 10am tomorrow** * 9:30am EST there will be orders in petitions and at 10am EST we will have opinions. ---------- **Important Petitions** For those of you who follow petition orders today was a big day for one particular case: recess appointments! "NLRB V. NOEL CANNING, ET AL. -The petition for a writ of certiorari is granted. In addition to the questions presented by the petition, the parties are directed to brief and argue the following question: Whether the President's recess-appointment power may be exercised when the Senate is convening every three days in pro forma sessions." Should be a fun case to watch next year. ---- **Opinions-** **Vance v. Ball State (Alito writes, 5-4)** *Issue:* Whether the  #8220;supervisor #8221; liability rule established by Faragher v. City of Boca Raton and Burlington Industries, Inc. v. Ellerth (i) applies to harassment by those whom the employer vests with authority to direct and oversee their victim #8217;s daily work, or (ii) is limited to those harassers who have the power to  #8220;hire, fire, demote, promote, transfer, or discipline #8221; their victim. *Opinion Summary:* The Court holds that an employer is a supervisor for vicarious liabilty under Title VII only if she has the power given by the employer to take tangible employment actions against the victim. " In Vance, the Court rejects the EEOC interpretation of who counts as a supervisor. In Vance, the Court defines 'tangible employment action' to include actions that have a 'significant change in employment status, such as hiring, firing, failing to promote, reassignment with significantly different responsibilities, or a decision causing a significant change in benefits.' " [Opinion](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/11-556_11o2.pdf) * The Seventh Circuit is affirmed. * Justice Ginsburg writes the dissent with Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan joining. * Supreme Court veteran Lyle Denniston has [pre-opinion analysis](http://www.scotusblog.com/?p=155622) over at SCOTUSblog. * Check out a thread from yesterday with more [info](http://www.reddit.com/r/law/comments/1gxfed/while_most_of_the_country_is_awaiting_the_big/) ----- **Mutual v. Bartlett (Alito writes,5-4 )** *Issue*: Whether the First Circuit Court of Appeals erred when it created a circuit split and held  #8211; in clear conflict with this Court #8217;s decisions in PLIVA v. Mensing, Riegel v. Medtronic, and Cipollone v. Liggett Group  #8211; that federal law does not preempt state law design-defect claims targeting generic pharmaceutical products because the conceded conflict between such claims and the federal laws governing generic pharmaceutical design allegedly can be avoided if the makers of generic pharmaceuticals simply stop making their products. *Opinion Summary:* The Court holds that design defect claims under state law that turn on the adequacy of a drug's warnings are preempted by federal law under PLIVA. [Opinion](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-142_8njq.pdf) * First Circuit Reversed * Justice Breyer dissents joined with Kagan and Sotomayor dissents joined by Ginsburg. ----- **U.S. v. Kebodoeux (Breyer writes, 7-2)** *Issue:* (1) Whether the court of appeals erred in conducting its constitutional analysis on the premise that respondent was not under a federal registration obligation until the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA) was enacted, when pre-SORNA federal law obligated him to register as a sex offender; and (2) whether the court of appeals erred in holding that Congress lacks the Article I authority to provide for criminal penalties under 18 U.S.C.  #167; 2250(a)(2)(A), as applied to a person who was convicted of a sex offense under federal law and completed his criminal sentence before SORNA was enacted. *Opinion Summary*: Registration requirement under SORNA as applied to Kebodeaux falls within the scope of Congress's authority under the Necessary and Proper Clause. *Opinion Summary Furthered:* Mike Gottlieb: "United States v. Kebodeaux is a case about the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SONRA), which requires federal sex offenders to register in the States where they live. Defendant was convicted of a sex offense, but had already served his sentence and been discharged when SONRA was enacted. The question in the case was whether Congress had the power to enact SONRA's registration requirements and apply them to an offender who had already completed his sentence when SONRA was enacted. The Court holds that Congress had that power under the Necessary and Proper Clause. The Court's opinion in Kebodeaux turns in significant part on the fact that the defendant was still subject to registration requirements under the federal Wetterling Act when he was released. As a result, the registration requirements of SONRA merely modified existing legal requirements. 'Congress could reasonably conclude that registration requirements applied to federal sex offenders after their release can help protect the public from those federal sex offenders and alleviate public safety concerns.' " [Opinion](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-418_7k8b.pdf) * The Fifth Circuit is reversed and remanded. * Justice Scalia and Thomas dissent. ---- **Fisher v. UT-Austin (Kennedy writes, 7-1)** *The decision is fairly narrow, Justice Thomas writes in his concurring opinion he would have overturned the landmark affirmative action case Grutter.* *Issue:* Whether this Court #8217;s decisions interpreting the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, including Grutter v. Bollinger, permit the University of Texas at Austin #8217;s use of race in undergraduate admissions decisions. *Opinion Summary:* Because the Fifth Circuit did not hold the university to the demanding burden of strict scrutiny articulated in Grutter and Bakke, its decision afffiming the district court's grant of summary judgment was incorrect. From Kennedy: "Strict scrutiny does not permit a court to accept a school #8217;s assertion that its admissions process uses race in a permissible way without closely examining how the process works in practice, yet that is what the District Court and Fifth Circuit did here. The Court vacates the Fifth Circuit #8217;s judgment. But fairness to the litigants and the courts that heard the case requires that it be remanded so that the admissions process can be considered and judged under a correct analysis. In determining whether summary judgment in the University #8217;s favor was appropriate, the Fifth Circuit must assess whether the University has offered sufficient evidence to prove that its admissions program is narrowly tailored to obtain the educational benefits of diversity." Amy Howe: "Justice Scalia's concurrence is very brief. He says because the petitioner did not ask the Court to overrule Grutter, he joins the opinion of the Court in full. The majority seems to reaffirm that diversity is a compelling interest if only because that rule was not challenged by the plaintiffs in the case." [Opinion](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/11-345_l5gm.pdf) * Fifth Circuit is vacated and remanded. * Justice Ginsburg dissents alone. Kagan was recused. * The NYT has their [analysis/blog](http://projects.nytimes.com/live-dashboard/2013-06-supreme-court-decisions?smid=fb-nytimes amp;WT.z_sma=US_LAO_20130624) up on the decision. * Ilya Somin has some analysis on the decision over at [the Volokh blog](http://www.volokh.com/2013/06/24/preliminary-thoughts-on-fisher-v-university-of-texas/). ----- **UTSW v. Nassar (Kennedy writes, 5-4)** *Issue:* Whether the retaliation provision of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C.  #167; 2000e-3(a), and similarly worded statutes require a plaintiff to prove but-for causation (i.e., that an employer would not have taken an adverse employment action but for an improper motive), or instead require only proof that the employer had a mixed motive (i.e., that an improper motive was one of multiple reasons for the employment action). *Opinion Summary*: The Court holds that Title VII retaliation claims must be proved according to traditional principles of "but for" causation, not the lesser causation standards stated in the law. Kevin Russell: "The question in Nassar was whether a provision of Title VII that permits a plaintiff to win by showing that discrimination was a "motivating factor" in an employment decision, also applies to claims of retaliation. The Court holds that it does not, so the plaintiff has to meet the higher burden of proving that the employer would not have taken the challenged action (say, termination) if the employee had not filed an EEOC complaint." [Opinion](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-484_o759.pdf ) * Fifth Circuit is vacated and remanded. * Justice Ginsburg dissents joined by Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan. * From Ginsburg's dissent: "Indeed, the Court appears driven by a zeal to reduce the number of retaliation claims filed against employers. Congress had no such goal in mind when it added the provision at issue in the case." * Check out a thread from yesterday with more [info](http://www.reddit.com/r/law/comments/1gxfed/while_most_of_the_country_is_awaiting_the_big/) ----- Pro-employer day at the Supreme Court, at least according to Ginsburg. * Kevin Russell: "In both of her dissents, in Vance and Nassar, Justice Ginsburg calls on Congress to overturn the Court's decision." * Justice Ginsburg's bench statement says of Vance and Nassar that "Both decisions dilute the strength of Title VII in ways Congress could not have intended...Today, the ball again lies in Congress' court to correct this Court's wayward interpretations of Title VII." ---- Thanks to SCOTUSblog and Oyez for the help and analysis today.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>One of the more important excerpts from the decision- "Strict scrutiny does not permit a court to accept a school #8217;s assertion that its admissions process uses race in a permissible way without closely examining how the process works in practice, yet that is what the District Court and Fifth Circuit did here. The Court vacates the Fifth Circuit #8217;s judgment.

Edit: "Given that the Court issued a rather plain vanilla 7-1 ruling remanding the case to the Fifth Circuit to apply strict scrutiny, why did it take nine months to issue the opinion?"</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A plausible theory is that Kennedy had to adjust his opinion several times to get a majority. This is one case where there is a guaranteed back and forth between the Justices. Or we are just overreading the process. Edit: I wonder if the prospect of a 4-4 vote dynamic had an effect on the result too? As in Justice Kagan was recused.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>SCOTUS Tuesday Thread- 6 Cases remain this morning</TITLE>
    <DATE>2013-06-25 15:57:12</DATE>
    <TEXT>* **Tune in Wednesday (TOMORROW) 10am EST for the remaining opinions which include PERRY/WINDSOR** * Welcome to the penultimate day for the Court to release opinions. We don't expect Windsor/Perry today but who knows. * I hear /r/SCOTUS is quite lovely this time of year. ----- **Opinions** **1) Koontz v. SJRWM (Alito writes, 5-4)** *Issue:* (1) Whether a land-use agency can be held liable for a taking when it refused to issue a land-use permit on the sole basis that the permit applicant did not accede to a permit condition that, if applied, would violate the essential nexus and rough proportionality tests set out in Nollan v. California Coastal Commission (1987) and Dolan v. City of Tigard (1994) (2) whether the nexus and proportionality tests set out in Nollan and Dolan apply to a land-use exaction that takes the form of a government demand that a permit applicant dedicate money, services, labor, or any other type of personal property to a public use. *Holding summary:* The government's demand for property from a land use permit applicant must satisfy the Nolan and Dolan requirements even when it denies the permit. [Opinion](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/11-1447_6j37.pdf) * Florida State Court is reversed * Justice Kagan dissents, with Ginsburg, Breyer, and Sotomayor. * "Significant victory for property rights advocates." * [Oyez](http://www.oyez.org/cases/2010-2019/2012/2012_11_1447) with the facts of the case and oral argument. ------ **2) Adoptive Couple v. Baby Girl (Alito writes, 5-4 )** **This is a victory for the adoptive parents** *Issue:* (1) Whether a non-custodial parent can invoke the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 (ICWA), 25 U.S.C.  #167; #167; 1901-63, to block an adoption voluntarily and lawfully initiated by a non-Indian parent under state law; and (2) whether ICWA defines  #8220;parent #8221; in 25 U.S.C.  #167; 1903(9) to include an unwed biological father who has not complied with state law rules to attain legal status as a parent. *Held:* "Assuming for the sake of argument that Biological Father is a  #8220;parent #8221; under the ICWA, neither  #167;1912(f) nor  #167;1912(d) bars the termination of his parental rights. Section 1912(f) conditions the involuntary termination of parental rights on a heightened showing regarding the merits of the parent #8217;s  #8220;continued custody of the child. #8221; The adjective  #8220;continued #8221; plainly refers to a pre-existing state under ordinary dictionary definitions. The phrase  #8220;continued custody #8221; thus refers to custody that a parent already has (or at least had at some point in the past). As a result,  #167;1912(f) does not apply where the Indian parent never had custody of the Indian child...Section 1915(a) #8217;s adoption-placement preferences are inapplicable in cases where no alternative party has formally sought to adopt the child. No party other than Adoptive Couple sought to adopt Baby Girl in the Family Court or the South Carolina Supreme Court. Biological Father is not covered by  #167;1915(a) because he did not seek to adopt Baby Girl; instead, he argued that his parental rights should not be terminated in the first place. And custody was never sought by Baby Girl #8217;s paternal grandparents, other members of the Cherokee Nation, or other Indian families." [Opinion](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-399_8mj8.pdf) * Justice Scalia dissents, and Sotomayor dissents which is joined by by Ginsburg and Kagan. * [Thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/law/comments/1gxfed/while_most_of_the_country_is_awaiting_the_big/) on the case from earlier this week ------ **3) Shelby County v. Holder (Roberts writes, 5-4)** **Section 4 is unconstitutional** **"Section 5 is now dormant"** *Issue:* Issue: Whether Congress #8217; decision in 2006 to reauthorize Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act under the pre-existing coverage formula of Section 4(b) of the Voting Rights Act exceeded its authority under the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments and thus violated the Tenth Amendment and Article IV of the United States Constitution. *Summary holding:* Section 4 of the Voting Rights Act is unconstitutional. Its formula can no longer be used as a basis for subjecting jurisdictions to preclearance. The Court emphasizes that: "There is also a  #8220;fundamental principle of equal sovereignty #8221; among the States, which is highly pertinent in assessing disparate treatment of States. Northwest Austin, supra, at 203. The Voting Rights Act sharply departs from these basic principles. It requires States to beseech the Federal Government for permission to implement laws that they would otherwise have the right to enact and execute on their own...Our decision in no way affects the permanent, nationwide ban on racial discrimination in voting found in [Section] 2. We issue no holding on [Section] 5 itself, only on the coverage formula. Congress may draft another formula based on current conditions." [Opinion](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-96_6k47.pdf ) * Ginsburg dissents, joined by Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan * [Oyez](http://www.oyez.org/cases/2010-2019/2012/2012_12_96) page with case facts and oral argument. * [Voting Rights Act](http://library.clerk.house.gov/reference-files/PPL_VotingRightsAct_1965.pdf) * [Statement](http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/06/25/statement-president-supreme-court-ruling-shelby-county-v-holder) by the President on Shelby. For those of you who do not know, President Obama was a constitutional law professor who had taught entire classes on voting rights. * Amy Howe: "Today #8217;s holding in Shelby County v. Holder, in Plain English: Today the Court issued its decision in Shelby County v. Holder, the challenge to the constitutionality of the preclearance provisions of the Voting Rights Act. That portion of the Act was designed to prevent discrimination in voting by requiring all state and local governments with a history of voting discrimination to get approval from the federal government before making any changes to their voting laws or procedures, no matter how small. In an opinion by Chief Justice John Roberts that was joined by Justices Scalia, Kennedy, Thomas, and Alito, the Court did not invalidate the principle that preclearance can be required. But much more importantly, it held that Section 4 of the Voting Rights Act, which sets out the formula that is used to determine which state and local governments must comply with Section 5 #8217;s preapproval requirement, is unconstitutional and can no longer be used. Thus, although Section 5 survives, it will have no actual effect unless and until Congress can enact a new statute to determine who should be covered by it." ---- Thanks to Oyez and SCOTUSblog with help as always</TEXT>

Holder, in Plain English: Today the Court issued its decision in Shelby County v. Holder, the challenge to the constitutionality of the preclearance provisions of the Voting Rights Act. That portion of the Act was designed to prevent discrimination in voting by requiring all state and local governments with a history of voting discrimination to get approval from the federal government before making any changes to their voting laws or procedures, no matter how small. In an opinion by Chief Justice John Roberts that was joined by Justices Scalia, Kennedy, Thomas, and Alito, the Court did not invalidate the principle that preclearance can be required. But much more importantly, it held that Section 4 of the Voting Rights Act, which sets out the formula that is used to determine which state and local governments must comply with Section 5 #8217;s preapproval requirement, is unconstitutional and can no longer be used. Thus, although Section 5 survives, it will have no actual effect unless and until Congress can enact a new statute to determine who should be covered by it." ---- Thanks to Oyez and SCOTUSblog with help as always</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Lyle Denniston over at [SCOTUSblog](http://www.scotusblog.com/2013/06/contraceptive-mandate-ruling/) agrees with you: "While the ruling did not confer constitutional status as religious persons on profit-making companies, it borrowed from First Amendment religious theory to help fill out the meaning of the twenty-year-old federal law. The religious person conclusion was based on the majority #8217;s view that corporations absorb, as their own, the religious views of their owners, and then conduct their businesses as a way to express those convictions. The majority did not give a precise definition of a RFRA corporate person, but its description seemed to closely track the characteristics of the two firms involved in the case. The dissenting judges complained that the majority had based its rulings upon supposition, not legal evidence."</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Howard Wasserman reviews "In Defense of Judicial Empathy" with a particularly interesting analysis on Justice Alito in two cases.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2013-06-29 03:27:44</DATE>
    <TEXT>*Colby does recognize a  #8220;nontrivial concern #8221; that a judge #8217;s empathy may turn into sympathy, prompting her to rule based on feeling sorry for one side of a dispute (particularly the poor, disadvantaged, or underdog side) rather than on the law. But this is not solely a liberal danger, as arguably demonstrated by Justice Alito #8217;s dissents in Snyder v. Phelps (invalidating civil judgment against public protests outside funeral) and United States v. Stevens (invalidating federal statute prohibiting video depictions of animal cruelty). Alito alone argued that expression lost its constitutional protection when it was aimed at the grieving parents of a deceased soldier  #8220;at a time of acute emotional vulnerability #8221; or when the expression depicted animals experiencing  #8220;excruciating pain. #8221; In his view, the harm and pain suffered by mourners and kittens, for which he clearly felt an affinity, trumped standard free-speech principles. In any event, that empathy might bleed into sympathy cannot mean that a judge should not possess or exercise empathy, only that she should (and likely will) strive to be aware of how one can lead to the other and to ensure that her empathy does not lead to subconscious sympathy-based decision making.* Full [review](http://courtslaw.jotwell.com/the-truth-about-empathy/)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[Meta] The future of r/SCOTUS in the summer recess and near future. Mission, submissions, facts, and fun.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2013-06-29 19:24:59</DATE>
    <TEXT>Good morning to all of you! Today we wanted to take some time to talk about /r/SCOTUS and the kind of subreddit we want it to become. ------ **First, our mission.** While /r/law has consistently served as a conducive environment for debate and discussion we hope /r/SCOTUS might be more narrowly tailored to your various interests. Be those interests the history of the court, debating the tenets and interpretations of the Constitution, following appellate cases, or understanding the aspects of the Federal Judiciary. **Why is this different than any number of blogs or other online resources I could go to?** /r/SCOTUS ought remain a place where a merited and warranted argument/comment is your defining contribution. Such content is not exclusive to an opinion or argument. Questions could be had to understand a particular dissent, a function of the Court, or an aspect of a specific statute. Honestly, the only individuals who probably don't publicize all their questions about SCOTUS are the Justices themselves. It is in the inherent nature of the Court (or Marbury v. Madison) that questions will proceed. But beyond the nature of the content itself the means in which it is presented is even more important. As redditors we have to opt out of anonymity. As such...your opinion, argument, comment, or question is not necessarily given weight by your pedigree or resume. We think this is a good thing. Maybe you went to a Top-25 tier law school, or are a Sophomore in college studying sociology, or are currently taking AP Government, or perhaps you may be Paul Clement. In some circumstances, as in the past, individuals may request a lawyer's opinion or expertise and obviously in some cases this is necessary. In cases where special knowledge is required it should be made explicit and without pretention. Yet, never feel as if any label precludes you from contributing substance. ----- **Second, a couple of facts.** * We have increased total subscribers by close to 50% in June alone. * In June we had more unique page views than in the entire sum of the preceding 9 months. These trends are due in large part to blockbuster cases at the Court and we went to keep up the momentum. ---- **Third, the blog roll!** We are trying to expand the blog roll on the right-hand side of the subreddit. If any of you have major blogs to contribute we will definitely add them. We are trying to get the whole spectrum of the blogosphere so as long as they remain fairly reasonable we will add your contribution. ---- **Fourth, submitting links.** As mentioned in our guidelines there are fairly few limitations on the type of content you can submit. Documentaries, book reviews, legal theory debates, etc., all are of course welcome. Like all other branches of Government the SCOTUS is prone to politicized commentary. What we would like to avoid is general puff pieces that lament on the Court's "apparent" political leanings. As in, pieces accusing the Court of being "too liberal" and "activist" with Hollingsworth v. Perry or "too conservative" and "activist" with Shelby County v. Holder. There are pieces that ascribe political meanings that can be substantive but /r/SCOTUS ought not be an apparatus of the echo-chamber. ------- **Lastly, the Summer Recess.** Without oral arguments, petitions, and of course opinions to be had there will be a natural doldrum amongst lawyers, students, and watchers of the Court alike. * Would any of you be interested in delving into the cases granted cert. for the Fall? This could be reviewing the briefs but as well analyzing lower court opinions. * As well, SCOTUSblog has a fun feature where law schools compete to accurately guess outcomes in several aspects of the SCOTUS be it granting cert. or the vote margins on cases themselves. We could have a much smaller version of that if there is interest. * SCOTUS book-club!! I'm excited too. There are several ways of going about this. We would likely mix up the type of books be them covering the Warren Court, the 5th Amendment, or more recent profiles by the likes of Jeffrey Toobin, etc. If there is general interest we could compile a list, vote, and get started.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't think this is necessarily true: "The court #8217;s action in reaching out to decide the future of voting rights in Shelby County v. Holder and affirmative action in Fisher v. University of Texas was, by contrast, an exercise of pure will, fueled by a desire to change settled law." Wouldn't the outcome say otherwise in Fisher? Also presumes we don't except the fundamental arguments of Shelby. While there is legitimate debate on the inclusion of the odd "equal sovereignty" phrase in the Roberts opinion... I am not convinced that such phrase is *prima facie* absurd. Greenhouse usually has more evidence over speculation, seems to do a little reaching in this article. Edit: Syntax</TEXT>

    <TEXT>True. Three responses. 1) SCOTUS delves into constitutional and statutory interpretation. This opinion also delves into both. You have everything here from questions on the First Amendment, Establishment Clause, even Justice Holmes is cited three times just in the first few pages. Not to mention the countless use of precedent that includes SCOTUS. The opinion also delves into jury instructions ("Prejudicial trial error") and proper legal representation. All issues that face appellate courts and SCOTUS alike. 2) The plaintiffs will likely "appeal" this decision to SCOTUS. I doubt they will be granted cert. but time will tell. 3) Ignoring other parts of the case, the First Amendment is definitely a point of tension in this opinion and this is probably a great forum to discuss said tension. There is a dissent that touches on several issues. I hope it merits a full read, really fascinating stuff! Edit: Syntax</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There is technically a list! Unfortunately it's in pieces and numbers in the thousands. So the Court has anywhere between 8,000 and 10,000 petitions a year. They grant cert. in less than 1%. Also unfortunately, to my knowledge at least, there is no aggregated list for the public. Here are a couple of resources that might resolve your well warranted curiosity. 1) [2012 Term Court Orders](http://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/ordersofthecourt.aspx). Here you have all of the orders from this year. Let's say you click [6/24/13](http://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/062413zor_n7ip.pdf) and you will find orders in grants of cert. among other things like calling for the views of the Solicitor General (expanded on below). The Court will expand on some of the denied petitions or even add questions to be covered as in the case of NLRB v. Canning. "The Solicitor General fulfills his role as the Court #8217;s adviser and advocate by responding to the Court #8217;s invitation to express the views of the United States in given petitions for certiorari. Here, the Solicitor General acts as a special type of amicus because the Solicitor General is not a party to the proceeding nor opining on behalf of one of the parties but rather acting as a sort of 'partner' to the Justices. When the Justices believe that, before they can grant or deny a petition for certiorari, they would like another opinion of the merits of a petition, they 'call for the views of the solicitor general,' known colloquially as CVSG" (Stefanie Lepore). 2) John Elwood over at SCOTUSblog does a [re-list watch](http://www.scotusblog.com/author/john-elwood) section that covers petitions. Often petitions will be re-listed for any numerable reasons. Check out some of the blog posts for more info. 3) SCOTUSblog keeps a [Petition section](http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/petitions-were-watching/) of their blog during the year. Obviously very sparse right now but they will have analysis on some petitions in terms of being granted and denied. I'm having a hard time linking it but if you find their "Term Snapshot" Site Map on the right hand side and click "Major Petitions" you can see what the Court is delving into next term as well. Hopefully that's somewhat helpful.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I agree entirely. But is it so much of a stretch that it's not plausible? I think it could be. The dissent obviously does a more clear job than me to make the same point. Let's look at the parts on Symbolic and Compelled Speech. **Symbolic** * Look at the very test the Court doesn't think is a perquisite: "Spence and Johnson asked whether a symbolic act or display was sufficiently imbued with elements of communication to trigger First Amendment scrutiny...As part of this inquiry, the Court considered two relevant factors: (1) an intent to convey a particularized message, and (2) a great likelihood that the message would be understood by those who viewed the symbolic act or display." 1) The particularized message in question is cultural and not embodying a "religious" element. 2) Upon seeing the image, Mr. Cressman  #8220;discerned that [it] depicted and communicated Native American religious beliefs in contradiction to his own Christian religious beliefs. #8221; Obviously OK doesn't seem to be communicating religious beliefs here but depicting them. Cressman didn't know anything about the image beyond it being Native American. Cressman needed to do his own research on the sculpture. "More specifically, he learned that the image depicted a sculpture by artist Allan Houser titled  #8220;Sacred Rain Arrow. #8221; According to the complaint, the sculpture is based on a Native American legend in which a warrior convinced a medicine man to bless his bow and arrows during a time of drought. The warrior shot an arrow into the sky, hoping the  #8220;spirit world #8221; or  #8220;rain god #8221; would answer the people #8217;s prayers for rain." Cressman himself proved the second prong false by his own deficit in knowledge on the specific topic and need to research it. * So if Spence and Johnson can't be precedent here how does the Hurley case work? What was the "point" or "particularized message" that OK was communicating similar to an LGBT group conveying equality in a private parade (The parallel the Court attempts to draw)? * "The Eleventh Circuit has concluded that Hurley  #8220;liberalized #8221; the Spence test such that conduct is expressive if a  #8220;reasonable person would interpret it as some sort of message, not whether an observer would necessarily infer a specific message." A reasonable person would not see all the uses of Native American culture by state governments in OK, AZ, CO, NM be them on coins, license plates, flags, heritage centers, etc., as endorsement of a native american religious message. * Cressman's response: "The license plate image retells this story and conveys a message that promotes "pantheism, panentheism, polytheism, and/or animism, #8221; to which he objects on religious grounds. Observers of this image  #8220;will understand that the plate communicates ideas and messages . . . about Native American culture and practices." Again, I see no endorsement of them. Any reasonable person would know New Mexico uses several different Native American motifs or images in their State Flag, government buildings, heritage sites, etc., because that is their heritage and equally it brings in tourism. **Compelled** *I think this is the better argument of the two barely* * "Over three decades later, the Court revisited Barnette in Wooley v. Maynard, a decision that is highly relevant to this appeal. Wooley concerned the constitutionality of New Hampshire #8217;s requirement that noncommercial vehicles display license plates featuring the state motto,  #8220;Live Free or Die. #8221; The plaintiffs, a husband and wife, were Jehovah #8217;s Witnesses who wished not to display the motto because it was  #8220;repugnant to their moral, religious, and political beliefs." The husband had suffered criminal penalties for covering up the motto, and the wife was equally as susceptible to state prosecution. The Court recognized that First Amendment protection  #8220;against state action includes both the right to speak freely and the right to refrain from speaking at all. #8221; New Hampshire #8217;s measure forced  #8220;an individual, as part of his daily life . . . to be an instrument for fostering public adherence to an ideological point of view he finds unacceptable. #8221; Requiring the plaintiffs to use their personal property as a  #8220;mobile billboard for the State #8217;s ideological message or suffer a [criminal] penalty #8221; implicated First Amendment protections and could be justified only by a  #8220;sufficiently compelling #8221; state interest." Ok so first this assumes there is some ideology being presented. I can buy that New Hampshire is establishing some ideology with the "Live Free" motto but I do not think that is happening here unless it's cherish your heritage and respect multi-culturalism. I see no Pantheistic ideology....No one knows what the sculpture is (the myth abou the arrow) unless they research it. This is absurd. * (Assuming they prove the ideology tenet of the argument) There could very well be a compelling interest such as cultural heritage or tourism that would allow the use of the image on the license plate. 3 million "billboards" promoting the cultural heritage of OK across the US sounds compelling to me even if it's an "ideology." **So is it plausible enough that he can sue? Yeah probably. Do I think it's an endorsement/compelled speech that forces injury in the case of special plates or breaking the law? Nope. Edit: I always have problems with syntax...**</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[Analysis] This week at the S.C. of Iowa: "The question we must answer is the one left open in Tenge #8212; whether an employee who has not engaged in flirtatious conduct may be lawfully terminated simply because the boss views the employee as an irresistible attraction."Opinion ruled in favor of "boss".</TITLE>
    <DATE>2013-07-17 22:10:22</DATE>
    <TEXT>The Iowa Supreme Court ruled in favor of the appellees, or "the boss" Mr. Knight. Here is the [opinion](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10405761351089135216 amp;hl=en amp;as_sdt=2 amp;as_vis=1 amp;oi=scholarr). Who arbitrarily decides if someone is an irresistible attraction? In this case beauty is literally in the eye of the beholder and thus I could argue any employee to be an irresistible attraction. Otherwise would we have a scale or test for someone being an irresistible attraction? Obviously the Court attempts to use the tension created between the spouses and the parties involved to prove that such attraction existed but is that enough of a standard? Are there other ways beyond "jealousy" of proving my attraction to someone? I think so. The Court writes: "Nelson raises a legitimate concern about a slippery slope. What if Dr. Knight had fired several female employees because he was concerned about being attracted to them? Or what if Ms. Knight demanded out of jealousy that her spouse terminate the employment of several women? The short answer is that those would be different cases. If an employer repeatedly took adverse employment actions against persons of a particular gender because of alleged personal relationship issues, it might well be possible to infer that gender and not the relationship was a motivating factor." Well multiple instances are not protected, patterns as employment law loves, but what about a single instance of termination being protected? That is still very odd. It continues: "Given that sexual harassment is a violation of antidiscrimination law, Nelson argues that a firing by a boss to avoid committing sexual harassment should be treated similarly...On the other hand, an isolated decision to terminate an employee before such an environment arises, even if the reasons for termination are unjust, by definition does not bring about that atmosphere." So an employer admits that there could be a possibility of sexual harassment but preemptively acts to avoid it by firing an employee? So odd again. Any employer who doesn't adhere to a pattern can in one instance fire a single employee under these circumstances? Odd odd odd.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>"The shift in linguistics from a nominalist view of natural languages (hence forth NLs) as (external) physical phenomena to a conceptualist view of them as (internal) psychological phenomena has greatly affected the field. Conceptualism has helped redefine the goals of linguistic investigation, broadened the factual basis for deciding among competing theories and placed linguistics among the natural sciences. After three decades of the dominance of conceptualism, linguistics is now widely seen as a branch of psychology/biology. In the early eighties, conceptualism was challenged by a new view of NLs. **This Platonist, or, as we say, realist, view takes NLs to be abstract objects, rather than concrete psychological or acoustic ones (as American structuralists had claimed).** This view is the linguistic analog of logical and mathematical realism, which takes propositions and numbers to be abstract objects. On a realist view, linguistics, like logic and mathematics, has no psychological goals, depends on no psychological data, and has no psychological status. And as in logic and mathematics, results can be of value in the natural sciences. But linguistics is an autonomous formal science with its own goals and domain of facts...The first argument, which we call the Type Argument, derives from the type/token ambiguity in terms like 'sentence', 'word', etc. As Peirce put it: "There will ordinarily be about twenty 'the's on a page, and of course they count as twenty words. In another sense of the word 'word', however, there is but one 'the' in the English language;... it is impossible that this word should lie visibly on a page or be heard in any voice."

    <TEXT>From the the [wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Idi_Amin_Dada:_A_Self_Portrait): "Director Barbet Schroeder has characterized the film as a "self-portrait" by Amin. While Schroeder and cameraman Nestor Almendros were given unprecedented access to Amin's daily life, the documentary makes it plain that many of the events (including the residents of a garrison town turning out en masse to greet Amin) were staged for their benefit. In several sequences, Amin actively directs the cameraman to particular points of interest, at one point shouting to "film that helicopter!" However, Amin's influence as a "director" went beyond the actual filming of Idi Amin Dada. As per his agreement with Amin, Barbet Schroeder made two versions of his documentary: the first, an hour-long cut, was released in Uganda and delivered directly to Amin, who was apparently pleased with the result. The second version was released only outside Uganda and contained an additional half-hour of footage and narration."</TEXT>

In granting relief, a single Justice must determine whether 1) there is a reasonable probability that four Justices will vote to grant certiorari, 2) there is a fair prospect that a majority of the Court will find the lower court's decision erroneous, 3) irreparable harm is likely to result from a denial of the stay, and 4) the balance of the equities among the parties and the public dictates granting a stay."

Not many blog posts or external summaries after two minutes. 3) If people prefer blogs and summaries hopefully they will be posted, I will post them later, or said individuals can seek them out. The summary by the respective majority author are at the top of the opinion anyways? Read them and ignore the rest if that pleases you. Also, not useful? That's laughable.

    <TITLE>Sibelius v. Hobby Lobby authorship speculation?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2014-06-25 21:09:17</DATE>
    <TEXT>The [stats](http://www.scotusblog.com/statistics/) for February cases suggest only Roberts, Kennedy, Scalia, and Alito have not produced an opinion for said month. Kennedy and Scalia have written 8 opinions already. Assuming that no Justice is likely to write more than 8 opinions and assuming a Justice would not write *two* opinions in a month that docketed only six cases... Hobby Lobby seems likely to be written by Roberts or Alito? Seeing as the Chief Justice (or senior Justice in the majority if the CJ is in the minority) gets to pick who writes/authors the majority opinion it would not seem unreasonable that CJR would choose himself in a major case healthcare case once again. Thoughts? As we know from the previous ACA case and even through the tenured history of SCOTUS these guessing games can be futile but there may be some reasonable predictions in sight. Edit: One last thought. This is also a tricky case because Kennedy seemed on the fence during oral arguments. CJ Roberts or the senior Justice in the majority might as well have given Kennedy the authorship if he ended up being the swing vote.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>"This decision concerns only the contraceptive mandate and should not be understood to hold that all insurance-coverage mandates, e.g., for vaccinations or blood transfusions, must necessarily fall if they conflict with an employer #8217;s religious beliefs...Other coverage requirements such as immunizations, may be supported by different interests (for example, the need to combat the spread of infectious diseases) and may involve different arguments about the least restrictive means of providing them." The OP's original question was if this decision can NOW extend to other coverage requirements. Alito explicitly says no. This is a narrow ruling but that obviously doesn't preclude other coverage requirements from being put to the said test. To suggest that this decision extends as far would miss the explicit and implicit text.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I took the decision to means as follows: Other coverage mandates have not had their day in Court so it would be rather broad to apply the rule to the whole without having a sufficient discussion on: 1) the compelling interest or interests involved with other coverage mandates (such as herd immunity for vaccinations), 2) the narrow tailoring of any specific statute or statutory requirement, and 3) whether each coverage mandate is the least restrictive means available for achieving the government's interest. Simply, "we" have not discussed or analyzed other coverage mandates/public health policies under strict scrutiny and can't comment on them until that point. Until "we" comment on them they remain a part of employer coverage. From the opinion. "This decision concerns only the contraceptive mandate and should not be understood to hold that all insurance-coverage mandates, e.g., for vaccinations or blood transfusions, must necessarily fall if they conflict with an employer #8217;s religious beliefs...Other coverage requirements such as immunizations, may be supported by different interests (for example, the need to combat the spread of infectious diseases) and may involve different arguments about the least restrictive means of providing them."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hear hear. I agree. If any employer is smart they could file suit immediately and regardless of the district court decision get coverage obligations lifted until the case threads its way through the appellate process for final comment.

    <TEXT>Josh Blackman and other commentators have been pointing to this specific portion of the dissent: "We agree with JUSTICE GINSBURG that the plaintiffs #8217; challenge to the contraceptive coverage requirement fails on the merits. We need not and do not decide whether either for-profit corporations or their owners may bring claims under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993. Accordingly, we join all but Part III #8211;C #8211;1 of JUSTICE GINSBURG #8217;s dissenting opinion." As Blackman points out on his blog- "How else could the claim fail on the merits, unless they could bring the claim in the first place?" Thoughts? *Eugene Volokh [comments](http://m.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2014/06/30/an-unusual-though-not-unprecedented-joint-opinion-in-hobby-lobby/) on the dissenter's form as well but not in this substantive fashion.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>How do you think cases reach the Supreme Court? This subreddit intended to include the entire federal judiciary as a possible topic of discussion for what I believe are not only logical but practical reasons. Of the tens of thousands of cases appealed to SCOTUS only around 80 are heard each year. Even those 80 have storied histories through the appellate process. The reasonings of lower courts can and do effect petitions of cert and discussions on the high court. While entirely improbable these cases in Guam could be appealed to SCOTUS and even granted cert. Actually, the highest amount of cases granted from any Circuit is from the 9th. Probably due to both the number of cases but also the "progressive" nature of the Circuit. Generally I would say don't miss the forest for the trees. Edit: (Effect over affect)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In particular, I find the comparative on the 'uncontroversial' element very fruitful. **Randolph in the majority:** "In our initial opinion we stated that the description at issue  #8211; whether a product is  #8220;conflict free #8221; or  #8220;not conflict free #8221;  #8211; was hardly  #8220;factual and non-ideological. #8221; NAM, 748 F.3d at 371. We put it this way:  #8220;Products and minerals do not fight 30 conflicts. The label  #8216;[not] conflict free #8217; is a metaphor that conveys moral responsibility for the Congo war. It requires an issuer to tell consumers that its products are ethically tainted, even if they only indirectly finance armed groups. An issuer, including an issuer who condemns the atrocities of the Congo war in the strongest terms, may disagree with that assessment of its moral responsibility. And it may convey that  #8216;message #8217; through  #8216;silence. #8217; See Hurley, 515 U.S. at 573. By compelling an issuer to confess blood on its hands, the statute interferes with that exercise of the freedom of speech under the First Amendment. See id. #8221; NAM, 748 F.3d at 371." **Srinivasan in his dissent:** "It is also worth noting what  #8220;purely factual and uncontroversial #8221; does not mean. While it might be said that the Conflict Minerals Rule #8217;s disclosure requirement touches on a  #8220;controversial #8221; topic, that alone cannot render the disclosure  #8220;controversial"...The term  #8220;DRC conflict free #8221; is a term of art defined in the Rule and statute: a product is  #8220;DRC conflict free #8221; if it contains no  #8220;conflict minerals #8221; originating in the DRC or adjoining countries that finance armed groups in those countries. The question whether a product has been  #8220;found to be  #8216;DRC conflict free #8217; #8221; thus calls for a  #8220;factual #8221; response: the product either has, or has not, been  #8220;found to be  #8216;DRC conflict free #8217; #8221; under the statutory definition. There is nothing non-factual about the required disclosure, nor is the factual accuracy of the disclosure subject to dispute. If geographic information about the sourcing of meat products qualifies as  #8220;purely factual and uncontroversial, #8221;so, too, does geographic information about the sourcing of a product #8217;s component minerals."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Also note the dissent. Three brief and succinct paragraphs: The First Amendment freedom of religion clauses serve  #8220;to assure the fullest possible scope of religious liberty and tolerance for all[,] . . . to avoid that divisiveness based upon religion that promotes social conflict[, and] . . . to maintain that separation of church and state that has long been critical to the peaceful dominion that religion exercises in this country. #8221; Trunk v. City of San Diego, 629 F.3d 1099, 1110 (9th Cir. 2011) (citing Van Orden v. Perry, 545 U.S. 677, 678 (2005)). First, despite arguments to the contrary, a twelve-foot tall statue of Jesus situated on government-leased land cannot realistically be looked upon as  #8220;predominantly secular in nature. #8221; Id. at 1107. Second, to determine the effect of the statue we ask whether  #8220;it would be objectively reasonable for the government action to be construed as sending primarily a message of either endorsement or disapproval of religion. #8221; Id. at 1109 (quoting Vernon v. City of Los Angeles, 27 F.3d 1385, 1398 (9th Cir. 1994)). I submit that a  #8220;reasonable observer would perceive #8221; the statue situated on government land  #8220;as projecting a message of religious endorsement. #8221; Id. at 1118.

    <TEXT>On a semi-related anecdote, Judge Douglas Ginsburg withdrew his nomination for the Supreme Court after his recreational use of marijuana came to light: "In November 1987, U.S. Court of Appeals Judge Douglas H. Ginsburg was forced to withdraw as President Ronald Reagan's nominee for a vacant U.S. Supreme Court seat that had been earlier denied to Robert Bork. The reason: Ginsburg's admission that he had used marijuana in the 1960s and 1970s while a college student and Harvard Law School professor. The disclosures about Ginsburg, first made by National Public Radio's Nina Totenberg and The Washington Post's Al Kamen, sparked a series of confessions to the press by other politicians about youthful drug experimentation, from U.S. Sen. Claiborne Pell (D-R.I.) on the left to U.S. Rep. Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) on the right. Included among the penitents were two Democratic presidential candidates at the time, U.S. Sen. Albert Gore of Tennessee and former Arizona governor Bruce Babbitt. Neither contender appeared at all damaged by their admissions of drug use in their 20s."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Due to an observable increase in posts that have a particular partisan valence this week this seems an apt time to remind users of our guidelines. A post, piece, article, etc. can of course have an opinion or a perspective. The necessary requirement is that that post be an informed opinion based on substance and law. Remember: * Please avoid submitting politically accusatory pieces with little or no substance. * Please avoid submitting images with little or no substance or images of text. Political cartoons are allowed only if linked to the original source or author; those submitted via imgur or similar will be removed. * Please do not post self-posts or comments which contain abusive or provocative language with perceived intent to incite hatred or discontent. Such posts and comments may be removed. If this is a difficult request we recommend the Gricean Maxims for some further reading. **What are Grice's Conversational Maxims?** In 1975, Paul Grice proposed the following conversational maxims in "Logic and Conversation": *Maxims of Quantity:* Make your contribution to the conversation as informative as necessary. Do not make your contribution to the conversation more informative than necessary. *Maxims of Quality:* Do not say what you believe to be false. Do not say that for which you lack adequate evidence.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Honestly it's more intellectually honest if we do allow for more than one guess because that's how a short list functions. At the same time the spray and prey technique makes the pool of potential winners much larger. We would all be interested in your top five but you must, like the President, pick one to stand as your contest nominee. I like the idea of the contest mirroring a hard executive decision. I would make the whole list but then highlight said one pick. Obviously in hindsight you will have been on record correct if another one of your choices is picked.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes I agree. I would prefer if the general premise of the article was not how Hinduism could affect decision-making on specific cases. Instead, at parts this is implied, the focus ought be on how experience from a Hindu person could help better inform them and bring a diversity of experience to the court. I see this as very similar to Obama's nomination speech for Sotomayor where [experience](http://edition.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/05/26/obama.sotomayor.transcript/index.html?iref=24hours) in diversity and obstacle was a salient part of the narrative.</TEXT>

No nationwide precedent, but the decision stands as precedent in the circuit from which the case hails.

Do you think your daddy would make a good judge? - You do, all right. Mr. Garland: Could the record note she nodded affirmatively? [Laughter] -- Senator KOHL. In the firmament, where do you put a circuit judge in the firmament of American life, public life? Mr. GARLAND. Well, that is a very hard question to answer. You know, I think that the most important role that a judge plays is to decide the cases in front of him, to decide them both with justice and with the appearance of justice. I think that is really the bed rock of our society. It sounds like a small role, but each judge playing that role creates the sort of underpinnings of our democratic society and it is an important role, but no particular judge #8217;s role is more important than any other #8217;s, obviously the Supreme Court aside</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Some of my favorite anecdotes plucked after a brief skimming: * "Provide a brief summary of and citations for all of your opinions where your decisions were reversed by a reviewing court or where your judgment was affirmed with significant criticism of your substantive or procedural rulings. Response: None of the opinions I have authored has been reversed, either by the Supreme Court of the United States or by the District of Columbia Circuit sitting en banc." By my count that is not one reversal out of 320+ majority opinions written. * We got some concrete dates when the ball started rolling on the nomination: "On February 29, 2016, I was called by Neil Eggleston, White House Counsel, and Brian Deese, Senior Advisor to the President, to ask whether I was willing to be considered for nomination as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court...I was interviewed by the President on March 9. On March 14, 2016, the President called to say that he intended to nominate me to the Supreme Court." Edit: I went back to double check the dates because I thought something was a bit odd. So the President calls Merrick on Monday is the official story. I remember President Obama telling Nina Totenberg that he had [told](https://youtu.be/BIoBwblIxws?t=5m22s) Garland over the weekend he was going to nominate him. Totenberg responds that Garland must have a great poker face because she had talked with him Sunday night "where he maintained that he didn't think he would get the nod." Why would Garland lie to Nina and just not plead the Fifth? I guess not saying anything would say everything. That's fair. Don't want her to break another SCOTUS nomination story. Or, the President just made a mistake and did really just call him on Monday or super late Sunday night. Why not just say that in the official form or in the interview more concretely? When pressed on the timeline as seen in the link above he's a little weird about it. Oh well! Not a big deal. Just curious. * From the list of his public speaking engagements I thought this one a bit odd. From 5/22/1984 at the DC Circuit Judicial Conference: "As an audience member, I asked the panel a question about administrative law. Transcript provided." Obviously it's better to include everything but this does seem a bit too far. Anyone want to go find the question and see what it seems so important to include?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I will put my hat in the ring and say the nominee will be 10th Circuit Judge Neil Gorsuch. Gorsuch is a Truman and Marshall scholar who attended Columbia, Harvard Law, and received his Phd at Oxford. He clerked on a federal appeals court and with TWO Supreme Court justices (Kennedy and White.) There is no doubt he is qualified in terms of experience and education (As was Merrick Garland.) Though he doesn't seem as outspoken on Roe as Sykes and Pryor he's still likely to be unfriendly to undoing abortion restrictions like those in Texas. In terms of capital punishment he tends to favor the government in capital cases. SSM and Obergefell seem unlikely to be revisited in the near future. Even if LGBT rights cases come up some conservative organizations have cried foul over several cases for example over Pryor seeming to support anti-transgender discrimination enforcement. Not as much a good reading on Gorsuch when it comes to LGBT cases. I also think Gorsuch's essential "treatise" against Chevron deference this year in a dissent that involved administrative law shows his inclination to deregulate and bolster federalism. These are judicial tenets conservatives (and the Federalist Society) are looking for. Also, from a personal standpoint I've interacted with Gorsuch several times (though we might not be on the same side of the aisle) and been present at several of his oral arguments. He is always the smartest guy in the room. Even at the 10th Circuit Conference this year where I was in attendance he was interviewing Kagan and I was thinking to myself these are two of the smartest legal minds in the country right now. Gorsuch will get the nom.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Day 1 is over. Return tomorrow at 9:30 am EST for first round of questions from Senators where more substantive and informative discussions start happening. IMO Two narratives coming out. First, from the Democrats. Strategy is two-pronged. 1) reject Gorsuch on grounds of ahistorical and unprecedented Garland obstruction 2) reject Gorsuch on the merits because a) social conservative who likely meets Roe "litmus test" and b) he purportedly rules against the "little guy." From the Republicans the strategy is clearly 1) Gorsuch is generally untouchable i.e. see bipartisan support and Dems grasping for straws in case parties not law. 2) Gorsuch is independent like the robes should connote. As per Gorsuch, "Ours is a judiciary of honest black polyester."</TEXT>
