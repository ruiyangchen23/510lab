    <TEXT>Title, want to do premed. New here, so don #8217;t crucify me if I #8217;m doing something wrong. I know my stats aren #8217;t great, but can someone suggest some good colleges that I can shoot for with these stats that have good bio/Chem programs? Preferably on the east coast. -3.69 UW GPA, 4.0W GPA -34 ACT, 1470 SAT -Taking Math 2 and Bio subject tests in August -Decent EC #8217;s, include: -volunteering at hospital, -shadowing a doctor (orthopedics), -head of some clubs at schools like community service, model UN, literary magazine, soccer captain etc. -Do volunteer work with mentally challenged children, helping them play baseball and soccer -Took a research course at JHU sophomore year. -Learned to program this summer (shoutout free code camp) - Various other EC #8217;s but nothing significant. Any suggestions? Thanks A2C</TEXT>

    <TITLE>High GPA? (Thicc)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-08-29 20:31:32</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hello Rutgers! I am currently a High School Senior, narrowing my list of colleges. I would be majoring in Bio/Biochem or something on the Premed track. My question was, after seeing schools like Stony Brook and Fordham that have Weed-out classes that have harsh curves that prevent more than a set number of people from getting A's, and therefore, hurt the GPA, does Rutgers make it difficult to get and maintain a high GPA in the same way? This is important because for a premed, GPA is king, and I wouldn't want to dig a hole for myself before starting. Also, this is my first post here, so please don't crucify me if I do something wrong lol.</TEXT>

I think OP thought that making a new account automatically gives him gold, when in fact, the only way to get it with all other currencies being value-less is to appeal to those who have already a good amount of gold and are willing to give it to those select few whom they enjoy their posts/comments.</TEXT>
