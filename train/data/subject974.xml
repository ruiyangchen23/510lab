    <TEXT>For some reason her comment seems to be in a spam filter so I'll just relay it here :  gt;A fun fact: I am trilingual. I Speak English, German and Esperanto. Also maybe interesting that I am a luthier, which is someone who builds and repairs stringed instruments. Brexit: Whilst obviously the EU issue is not something that is handled at the local level, I was disappointed by the outcome of the referendum. I do however respect the result. What I don't agree with is the 'hard brexit' being pushed by the current Tory government, which entails leaving the single market. That was not on the ballot paper for the referendum, and most people I have met who voted leave did not vote to leave the single market. Therefore there is no mandate to do so currently. I also believe that leaving the single market would be a disaster for the British economy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In all honesty this is something you should have considered before launching the site. It just looks like you put together as many random Aliexpress dropship stuff as possible and trying to flog it all. Focus on one theme then start working on branding, Facebook ads and Adwords are what you should be starting on but before that fix your site because it looks shit, especially pictures of products as if you don't you are lowering your conversions</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There aren't many faults with Amazon with their fast delivery, cheapest prices, easy checkout, great customer service etc. So other ecommerce stores must be suffering, I mean unless you sell one of a kind products on your own website then theres no reason for people to go elsewhere but if thats the case then you're losing money by not selling on Amazon. I get the only complaint really is I don't like the search filters/features all that much but that may just be me, although Amazon needs to tackle the problem of oversea Chinese sellers with long shipping times before that becomes a problem edit: If I didn't have one click ordering turned off [I would be exactly like this guy](http://imgur.com/gallery/n4E23) I guess thats another con, Amazon needs drunk buyer protection</TEXT>

Thats simply not true, at aged 20 you likely don't have any kids or dependents, not many bills to pay if living at home etc so you should have much more time to work on the site, I'm not sure where your hours saved are going as you haven't done the basics like getting a domain name, site still looks fairly amateur, you don't create your own content for social media as you are just taking others presumably without permission, you don't write blogs posts all that often. I think you shouldn't get too carried away that just by quitting your job you are on the path to success, you should take as much advice as you can here instead of trying to give it out EDIT : Nevermind, she's not interested in feedback, she just loves posting her link wherever she can to get views, doubt she is getting any sales on a predominately male forums, catering to the wrong crowd</TEXT>

    <TEXT>One was a battery controlled vibrator and a second was a flashing lights Newton's cradle. A third wasn't an electronic but had a adhesive sticking so they all had to be a high standard product. The only thing I've stayed away from is clothing/apparel as I feel you need too much communication to pull it off and a lot of refining the product, there'll be lots of issues such as quality and sizing issues in those instances</TEXT>
