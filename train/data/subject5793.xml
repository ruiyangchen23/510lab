    <TEXT>I'm on the same boat. I sometimes smoke and just bum it the rest of the day and other times it motivates me to go to the gym or do homework or something productive. Every toke is a different experience which is why I smoke so often. It makes me happy so if you toke because it makes you happy I domt see the problem with it. Usually what I do is if I smome immediately when I get home from school I tell myself ill go to the gym or do something productive. Whatever you think you need to do you should do.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Like 2 weeks ago I was at the library seeing my math tutor and apparently someone accidentally side swiped my car trying to park. It wasn't even a bad scratch it was really just the paint from her car. Anyway, we called our insurance company and my dad took it into the shop. They said they can either take the car for 3 or more days to get it fixed which In the end would cost $804.57 to fix OR they'd Write us a check for $804.57 and have us do what we want with it. My dad thought it was a joke until the lady assured him they were serrious. So my dad was all like. "So I can just go home and use materials from my house to get this scrape out of the car and you'd still write me a check for $804.57?" She said yes so of course he took the check...but of course he ended up putting the money in his checking account and didn't even give me a share; I mean after all this wouldn't have happened if I wasn't at the library TL;DR my dad made $804.57 because I was at the at the right place and time</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This actually has a very funny backstory, I wouldn't even be surprised if you guys didn't believe me. Earlier that night I was with a few friends and they were smoking but didn't share with me at all. Which is fine because I don't like asking to be smoked out if I didn't have money to contribute. Decided to leave them and hangout with another friend. We got wasted together. Ended up going home after 4am. It is dead silent at night with barely any cars or people outside. So, there I am just walking down the street when I see this thing sitting on one of the bus stop benches. After shining my phones light on it I was in shock. As if the weed gods were watching over me earlier wishing I had some of the good kush, I a fucking jar of it now. In my wasted state of mind I of course took it (I know now that it could have not been a smart idea. Like it could have been a trap or it could have been laced weed). Anyway the first time I had the chance to open the jar...oh my god the dank smell, you just knew it was good weed by the smell, let alone the denseness of the nugs. Of course I pulled one gravity bong from it and was high as fuck. On the other hand I feel bad for the poor guy that mustve been so high he accidentally left it there :( but he has blessed another dry stoner with this amazing gift, as if it was money he donated to the needy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Taken from the description: "On September 11, 2001, I brought my camera to school to shoot some footage of my friends before Calculus class. As I was known as one of the school's resident filmmakers, it wasn't unusual for me to always be carrying my camera around. The bell rang. Our teacher Mr. Perencevich came in and announced,  #8220;Some idiot flew a plane into the World Trade Center. #8221; UPDATE: Someone from the video got in contact with me and I asked him if the original filmaker knew of the video and this is the response he gave me. "He does, I just messaged him. We are having a mini reunion via facebook right now. One of the people in the video even made an epilogue for you: "Also, this feels like it needs some kind of epilogue... Today, the filmmaker still keeps in touch with his friends from high school and is still interested in film making. Two of the students are married (to each other). One is a medical doctor. And another went on to attend West Point and continues to serve his country. We can only assume that the twins are no longer wearing matching outfits today. :)" Thanks for bringing but both good memories, and some sad ones too."</TEXT>

Robinson is located right outside of D.C. and many family's in the area had/have family that commute to D.C. for work. Thanks for all the comments guys, i'm glad I get to read so many of your stories.

There was a post on reddit about Peta being shitty, and then Michael Scott trashed Peta at the beginning of the episode I was watching at that same moment.

    <TEXT>Just last night at dinner I was explaining this exact thing to my family. My eyesight is very poor (-7.0, -7.5) and my sister was wondering what I could see without my glasses because she can take hers off and still function. Me on the other hand, would be screwed if there was some sort of apocalypse and I lost my glasses.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>We clean them out and prescribed ear medication. It's not something I've ever seen be fatal, but if left untreated can be detrimental to the animals health. So if you notice that your pet has really dirty ear and is showing signs of pain or irritation on the ears, then I would definitely go get them checked out by a vet.</TEXT>
