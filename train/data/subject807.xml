    <TITLE>[hair removal product] green gel for removing hair</TITLE>
    <DATE>2012-08-06 07:29:54</DATE>
    <TEXT>My wife has a nerve disorder that makes shaving difficult and irritates her legs. For the same reason, waxing is also off the table. I remember seeing an infomercial years ago (talking more than 10 years now) for a product but I can't remember the name of it. It was a gel (dark green if memory serves) and they would roll it into a ball, press it against the skin and flatten it out. After a few minutes they would remove the gel and the hair was gone. I don't think it was a wax because it desolved the hair instead of pulling it out. Anyone know the product I'm thinking of, does it actually work, and is it still available?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I wrote this a couple of years ago as I found myself getting more and more disgruntled and disgusted about the direction this country is going due in large part to the bickering and school yard bullshit going on in Washington. Unfortunately it didn't get the widespread coverage I was hoping for, but at the time I hadn't discovered Reddit yet.

    <TITLE>Is the caller ID record sufficient to receive a call back under non-emergency situations, or is a voice-mail still required?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2012-10-02 01:50:43</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I work disconnected from my immediate supervisor so we do not see each other on a daily basis. Our offices are 25 miles apart so we communicate most often through the use of employer issued cell phones. There is a meeting held every other Tuesday at 9 AM, sometimes it directly involves my position and sometimes it has no bearing whatsoever on my position. I always have advance notice whether my position will be involved in the meeting or not but have standing instructions from my supervisor that I will attend each meeting regardless of my involvement unless I clear it through him 1st. A situation arose where a work related issue came to my attention at 8 AM the morning of a meeting where I knew I wouldn't be involved. I called my supervisor's cell phone 5 times and his assistant's cell phone twice (both of them are absolutely required to attend the meetings and generally arrive early to prepare). Because I knew the meeting didn't involve my position, and I didn't feel the situation was an emergency I didn't leave a voice mail. I felt the caller ID records of the 7 calls I attempted to make would be sufficient to warrant a call back when he was available. I was written up for missing the meeting without getting prior authorization. Am I the only person who feels that voice mail is something that should be used for emergency situations only now that caller ID is so prevalent?</TEXT>

Also, I noticed that when viewed on a mobile device (Android Razr in my case) or a tablet (Galaxy Tab 2 10.1) my top nav menu bar shrunk to about half the width of the page and jumbles the links up.

    <TITLE>Fentanyl Patches users does changing your patch keep you awake?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2013-04-15 01:12:03</DATE>
    <TEXT>My wife has been on a Fentanyl Transdermal Patch for quite some time to treat Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy (RSD), recently renamed to Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS). Her dose is the 75 mcg/hr patch changed every 48 hrs and she's been on this for well over a year. She usually tries to change it late morning/early afternoon but sometimes forgets until the late evening. She has noticed that on those nights, she tends not to sleep well, or at all, and is wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences. She doesn't know for sure that it's the patch that keeps or up, or maybe pain from changing it late. Being that it is a very powerful Opioid, I can't see how it would keep her awake, and knowing how transdermal systems work, I wouldn't think that a couple of hours would be enough time for it to "kick in" and keep her awake if it has that ability.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have a tattoo on my right shoulder blade of a Dragon perched on the edge of a cliff. I have always wanted to go into a shop and give an artist (after reviewing their work of course) complete freedom to cover my back with whatever they wanted with the caveat that it had to include and work around my existing piece. Is this plausible and a good idea? The existing piece is over 10 years old, but due to a kick ass artist, good care, and not a lot of direct sunlight it still looks pretty good. If done correctly, and reworked where it needed it, would it still look like a 10 year old tattoo wrapped around a new piece?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I installed these vinyl flames on my hood 7-8 years ago. Since then they have become sun baked, dried out, cracked and basically look like shit. I want to take them off, so I can replace them with new ones. I already have the new ones, bought them before I removed the old ones, and now I can't get the old ones off. Here are the methods I've tried so far: 1. Heat gun + scraper/razor blade 2. Several different "Goo Gone" type products + heat gun + scraper/razor blade 3. Rubber eraser "decal removal" tool + power drill 4. Orbital polisher + rubbing compound Are there any other options left other than sanding down to bare metal and repainting? http://imgur.com/a/6u52v</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Questions before pulling the trigger</TITLE>
    <DATE>2013-05-10 07:54:03</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've been a lurker here for awhile and I've always been a fan of how classy shaving with a SR or DE razor looks although I've never experienced it myself. I am now ready to join the club and start enjoying the best shaves of my life. From what I've read, like most of you before, I absolutely detest the act of shaving. I hate it, I hate it, I hate it. Did I mention that I hate it? I currently use the Fusion Pro-glide Power and have found it provides the most comfortable shave for me with the vibrations (a lovely gimmick by their marketing company). In the past I have tried both of the electric shaving options (rotating head and foil) and didn't really care of either of them. Because I hate shaving and spent 10 years on active duty where I had to shave, and I now have a job that allows me the freedom, I only shave at most twice a week (whenever the wife bugs me enough to stop looking scraggly). So given the provided information, which will provide me with a better shave? DE or SR? I am more partial to the SR but I am not sure if either one is better at tackling 5-7 days worth of growth between shaves. I understand that most of you who came here shaving like me now shave daily, but until I reach that level of excitement, I'd just like to enjoy a close comfortable shave without all the pulling and tugging that is inherent in cartridge shaving. Thanks for the info so far!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hello W_E! So I was antique shopping today while my wife was having a meeting. Found the following blades while I was out and wanted some help identifying them and seeing if any of them would be worth the investment, or were worth the asking price. The 1st was in one store for $25. Has plastic scales and the pins seem to be quite tight, held tension on the blade well and wasn't sloppy at all. The blade is stamped Morris Mfg Co, Detroit Mich on one side and Fascination on the other. The blade looks like it's in rough shape and I'm not sure if it's salvageable. The 2nd has really nice looking scales and comes with the original box. The blade is stamped J.A. Henckels Twin Works, Solingen, Germany. The edge looks in pretty decent shape and asking price was 179.95 The 3rd was my favorite find by far. Asking price was $159.95 with the original box. The scales look great with some nice scroll work. Stamped on one side Hollow Ground, MFG in Germany and on the other Henry Sears, 1865. One side of the edge says Henry Sear's  amp; Son 1865. What do you all think? http://imgur.com/a/wkDJq</TEXT>

    <TITLE>RAD already?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2013-05-20 07:39:03</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I haven't even started DE shaving yet, I have to wait for Father's Day to get my setup and learn what marvelous purchases my wife made for me to commemorate that wonderful holiday after hearing me hinting at wanting to try it for the last 6 months. I have posted here a few times, and devour the information, pictures, and stories here daily. I am hoping to be able to apply the information that you all put out when I finally get to experience my first wet shave and have it be as successful as I hope it will be. I have found myself stopping into antique stores for the 1st time in my life looking for vintage gear, scouring the internet to see what's available knowing that I can't purchase anything at the moment, I'm just enjoying window shopping. I can feel the onset symptoms of RAD already and I haven't even started yet. After seeing [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/wicked_edge/comments/1ekymi/youve_made_me_a_monster_my_collection_so_far_and/) the other day, I just know I will have a similar setup before I even realize it (that is absolutely beautiful OP). I do have some questions though that I am sure can be answered rather easily. 1. What is the difference between straight guard, open comb, and closed comb DE razors? Is it just an esthetic or does each serve a specific purpose? 2. I've been a cartridge shaver my entire life. I know that my facial hair grows in different directions just like everyone else and even have a perfect whirl on my left cheek although I haven't done a full map yet. I know this spot specifically will require some unique strokes and probably some buffering before I get it just right. When shaving I have always used a simple top to bottom stroke regardless of growth direction which works great on the cheeks and jawline but wrecks havoc on my neck. I found out early that attempting an against the grain stroke for me meant days and even weeks of bumps, ingrowns, and irritation. Does that still apply when wet shaving or am I walking into a whole new world of shaving satisfaction? I know to start with a WTG and XTG passes and work up to ATG passes with time after building a good technique, but given my history, should I avoid the ATG pass altogether?</TEXT>

    <DATE>2013-05-26 07:33:11</DATE>
    <TEXT>So as many of you know I'm just getting into this and it's grabbing me pretty quickly. I'm already considering buying hones and woodworking tools to repair SRs and scales as a hobby, and even priced lathes last night for making brush handles as that looks like something that I would enjoy spending my free time on. This is getting crazy and I haven't even gotten to experience my 1st DE shave yet!! Help me!!! j/k I have gone browsing through antique stores but don't really know what I'm looking at when I look at razors. What are the sought after SR brands and DE brand/models that I should be keeping my eyes out for, and what kind of price points should I be looking at? I posted pics of a couple of SRs that I found and the general consensus was that they were priced about 3 times more than they were worth. I saw the link at SRP that lists 'good blade' vs 'bad blade' companies as far as reliable steel goes, should I just copy that list and carry it with me while browsing? Is there another reference I can use as well? Is a SR that needs a lot of loving care in order to be shave ready ever worth more than say $40? I know it's best to carry a small ruler with me to measure the steel, at what point does it become a bad buy when it comes to vintage razors? As for DEs, what are the brands/models that I should be on the lookout for, especially ones I should pounce on if I find one and the brands, if any, that I should avoid? I posted my Gillette Super Speed and it was easily identified by the man code on it, is this information available somewhere online? Do all manufacturers have a similar system to ID the age as well? I'm one of those guys who enjoys that 'immediate' buyer's satisfaction, and I hate seeing something and then having to take a pic of it to get it ID'd before I buy it so any and all information would be greatly appreciated.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Best cartridge shave EVER!!!</TITLE>
    <DATE>2013-06-03 05:43:20</DATE>
    <TEXT>Ok I know most of you just shuddered, and your beards collectively just jumped back into your skin (You're welcome for the free shave btw), but let me explain... Although my flair says otherwise, I have been a cartridge shaver or electric shaver my whole life. Come Father's Day I'll receive my 1st real set from my wife and will enjoy the 1st wet shave of my life (hopefully, don't know if she got me blades). I've gotten seriously hooked on this topic thanks to you guys, and am constantly getting crap from SHMBO about the amount of time I spend here considering I don't shave like this yet. My normal shave routine has always been to lather using canned gel by rubbing it as gently as possible onto my face (I don't want that crap on my face so I don't rub it in very much), then shave as quickly as possible by pressing as hard as needed in order to get it done as fast as possible, and then take a shower to wash the horrible smell of the gel off my face. 3 days ago while gently applying my gel, I thought about all the tips and things I've read here about prep and began scrub and rub it into my face vigorously in all directions, really trying to give my 5 day growth a workout before attacking it with my 3 week old cartridge blade. I started shaving and halfway through my face I realized how hard I was pressing, and actively started working on my pressure. I'd be lying if I said the tugging and pulling was comfortable as like I said my cartridge was old and the "soothing goo strip" was white a crusty at the beginning of my shave. I kept it up though, making my general top to bottom stroke, giving no acknowledgement to grain direction, until I was through. At then end, I had the same level of shave I was used to having at the end of my shave. Then, on a whim, I re-lathered and began a very slow and light against the grain pass (by against the grain I mean bottom to top). The sound I got from my razor during that pass almost made me smile. The light scraping sound of the last of my whiskers being cut and beaten into submission was exhilarating! After I was through I hopped in the shower. While washing my face I was met with the smoothest surface I've felt since I was probably 15. There was absolutely no sting from the soap, no irritation when I dried off, and for the rest of the night I kept unconsciously rubbing the smoothness of my face. It is now 3 days later, and I just now have the amount of stubble I am accustomed to having when I wake up the day after I shave. I have no razor burn, red bumps, or ingrowns which is amazing to me given the atrocious condition of my razor when I used it, and I am actually looking forward to my next shave where I'll use a new cartridge (my last given the timeline of Father's Day coming), use a beard map in order to concentrate on an initial WTG and final ATG pass, and listen to that sweet sweet music of my whiskers disappearing completely. I'd like to thank each and every one of you, you all make this the absolute best community on Reddit IMHO. I do have a few questions (I always seem to have questions when I post here haha). Given my routine of shaving before a shower due to the fact that I hated leaving the smell of Edge on my face that no amount of cologne could completely erase, how important to the process is the pre-shave shower provided I use a good glycerin soap as part of my prep routine? Also being a self described cologne whore (the shelf I've been given by SHMBO for my cologne collection would rival even the most RAD afflicted member's razor collection), are the smells of the generally suggested soaps, creams, and post shave care products over powering? Ie, should I stick with my shower after the shave in order to remove those smells? If it turns out that my wife neglected to get me blades with the kit, what has been everyone's experience with Wilkinson Swords? Looking around the B amp;M stores in my area, those seems to be the only ones available (around $1.50 per pack of 10). I know with blades that YMMV, and I've read all the posts on blades and that everyone and every razor reacts differently to different blades, but are they quality enough to use as a starter, get my technique down for a month or so before jumping into a sampler pack? TL;DR Holy wall of text...just read it haha</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Lather fell apart</TITLE>
    <DATE>2013-06-05 00:14:04</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I broke down and got the cheap VDH set (soap, brush, bowl $8.50) along with some Rite Aid brand blades and set off for my 1st wet shave last night. I set the brush under the faucet in the sink under hot running water for several minutes, shook it out and put it back under the water for another couple of minutes. Turned off the water and held the brush bristles down until the water stopped running out of it and placed it standing on the handle while I showered. Picked up the brush without shaking it or anything and immediately ran it over the puck of soap in the bowl vigorously. Watched the suds start to form and kept going, when I thought I had loaded enough soap onto it I kept going for another 30 seconds or so. Took the brush to my face to start to build lather. The brush was surprisingly soft against my face, I was anticipating a stiffer feeling brush and was happily surprised. Ran the brush over my face using both swirls and paint brush strokes. As the lather built it started feeling a little dry/sticky so I added a few drops of water to the brush and continued to to lather. I then started my 1st shave. It went pretty well considering... I was confident in my ability because of the information you all have provided. Finished my WTG pass and relathered and that's when I noticed the lather on the brush was not nearly as thick or creamy as it was at the beginning. Did my XTG pass and on a whim relathered for an ATG pass. I should have stopped with the XTG pass, not because of lack of technique, but because my lather by then was more of a film. All in all I was very satisfied with my shave. It was equal to the shave I posted about the other day with my cartridge razor with a few spots of stubble that I missed here and there. Had a small amount of blood/burn along my right jawline (I'm left handed) so need to work on my technique in that area. My lather problem is most likely just inexperience combined with slightly hard water. I'll make some practice lathers between now and my next shave. PSA for noobs, the razor holds a LOT of heat from a quick rinse under hot running water. That was a shock putting the head against my face and almost jumped which would've been messy and bloody haha.

    <TEXT>Ok so I'm browsing all the artisinal soap makers trying to find a few soaps with a variety of scents. My question is, how do you all store/use your rounds? Looking at [Honeybee Soap's Variety Set](http://www.honeybeesoaps.net/catalog.php/HoneybeeSoaps/dt63266/pd1309767/3_piece_Shaving_Soap_Variety_Set) and [Mama Bear's 1.5 oz pucks](http://mamabearssoaps.com/index.php?main_page=index amp;cPath=1_12) and others that don't come in their own container, do you just have several mugs on your shelf with your different soaps in them? Or do you use a puck in a mug and swap it out when you want a different 'flavor' so to speak, and if so how do you store your unused pucks? Also, and this question is asked a lot, and is absolutely YMMV, but what are your favorite scents? I am not a fan of citrus scents (lime, grapefruit, etc), coconut (which I think eliminates the ever popular Bay Rum), flowery, or musk scents. My tastes in cologne tend to run toward either 'Sweet', 'Fresh/Sport', or 'Woody' scents. EDIT* I ended up ordering the 3 pack variety set from Honeybee Soaps in Dragon's Blood, Oakmoss, and Vanilla Oak and the Vanilla Cream Glycerin Shave Soap 5 oz. puck in a plastic tub from Mama Bear</TEXT>

I use so little pressure it sometimes doesn't even feel like the razor is even touching my face, but the removal of stubble tells me it's doing the job. Rinse after the 1st pass and relather for XTG pass using same angle and pressure. Rinse and relather for ATG pass with same angle and pressure (I'm guessing that most probably this is what is causing my problem). Rinse and use a [Styptic pencil](http://shop.riteaid.com/dp/B0077RAXEW#.UbAcGpyndWs) where needed. I don't have an alum block yet so today I just wet the whole pencil and rubbed it over my face like I would an alum block if I had one and let it sit for a few minutes while I cleaned my brush and bowl before rinsing it off, not sure if that did anything positive or negative, but it did burn quite a bit (PSA Don't lick your lips if you do this lol). Pat my face dry and apply the Post Shave Lotion. Result: After 3 days of this routine, [this is how I look](http://imgur.com/a/0GJ7d#3). These pictures were taken approx 7 hours after my most recent shave. Plans: Amazon has been out of stock on MRGLO for awhile, but I did pick up a bar of [Pears Transparent Soap Gentle Care](http://www.amazon.com/Pears-Transparent-Soap-Gentle-Care/dp/B000HZG1Z6/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8 amp;qid=1370495581 amp;sr=8-5 amp;keywords=pears+transparent+soap) at my local Dollar Tree today. Is this sufficient for a pre-shave glycerin soap? I have in my shopping cart on Amazon a [Barber Alum block](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VXELII/ref=ox_sc_act_title_4?ie=UTF8 amp;psc=1 amp;smid=A2BHMCU53S5CWK), a [Pacific Shaving Company Nick Stick](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013H6AVM/ref=ox_sc_act_title_3?ie=UTF8 amp;psc=1 amp;smid=A2U8FF7ZAAO2TC), [Arko Shaving Soap Stick](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00997FR44/ref=ox_sc_act_title_2?ie=UTF8 amp;psc=1 amp;smid=A1NODD7204E1R4), and [Musgo Real Glycerine Lime Oil Soap](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QYCXR8/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?ie=UTF8 amp;psc=1 amp;smid=A22FBICCCAPKIO) (Is this the real stuff u/Leisureguy?) but since 2 of those 4 items are 'add-on' items and my cart isn't at $25 yet, they will have to wait about 10 days til payday before I can add a couple of random items and submit the order. Anything else I can try in the meantime to ease my suffering a little? I plan to take a day or two off before attempting my next shave, and forgo the ATG pass for awhile.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>What I learned today, Otherwise known as Shave #4</TITLE>
    <DATE>2013-06-08 02:02:51</DATE>
    <TEXT>So today I got to use a glycerin soap in my prep for the 1st time. Took a shower, washed with my Clearasil, dried off after. Washed with the glycerin soap and left the soap on while I built my lather in the bowl. Changed my blade out for a new one and did a one splash rinse to wash off the soap. Started applying my lather and this is something that's been bugging me and seems to happen every time. How much water do you personally leave on your face when you rinse both before the initial pass and in between passes? Today my face was left rather wet, and each time I lathered I found that my rich creamy lather that I built in my bowl turned into a wet soapy mess on my face and no amount of trying to 'whip it into shape' on my face would return it to the rich creamy lather that I wanted. I even attempted to go back into the soap at one point and brought it back to my face. Don't get me wrong, it was a 'good enough' lather, but it had visible bubbles and I couldn't seem to get rid of them completely on my face. I'm currently using the cheap VDH soap (Mama Bear should be here tomorrow and Honey Bee should be here early next week) for what it's worth. Started shaving, referring to my printed beard map in order to ensure an actual WTG pass. I had been pretty close in the past, but in a few spots I had been starting out with an XTG pass. Halfway through my XTG pass I adjusted the grip on my razor. This is something that I haven't seen discussed here very often. Many people comment on the correct way to hold the brush (handle in the palm and fingers griping the bristles near the knot not on the handle itself), but not many people comment on where to hold the razor itself. Coming from a cartridge razor, I had been holding my razor way down on the end of the handle like I did my old Cart razor. When I adjusted my grip I moved my fingers way up the handle so they were actually underneath the cap. The difference was immediately noticeable as I started shaving again. It was so much easier to attain the correct angle and instead of making the long slow passes I had been making I started instinctively making much shorter quicker passes which seemed to be a lot more effective. Using this technique I was able to make an amazing ATG pass and after rinsing at the end of my ATG pass I found a few spots of stubble so I re-lathered those spots and using the 'new to me' technique was able to tackle those as well. Finished my shave up without a nick or weeper at all for the 1st time. No styptic needed!!!! TL;DR How wet is your face when you apply lather to prevent it breaking down for those of you who use a bowl? Leisureguy I know you (and others) are big fans of face lathering but I'm just not that up to it yet. Hold the razor way up on the handle underneath the cap not down at the end of the handle Make short half inch long quick passes as opposed to 2-3 inch long passes.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Skin adjustment period</TITLE>
    <DATE>2013-06-10 07:28:27</DATE>
    <TEXT>When you all made the jump to wet shaving, how long did it take your skin to adjust to the new technique? I know from past history that anytime I've change shaving tools (carts to rotary electric, back to carts, to foil electric, back to carts) it took a few weeks for my skin to adjust to the new tool. Should I anticipate the same length of adjustment until my skin 'calms down' so to speak? I'm really enjoying the shaves, but my face is kind of....raw is too harsh a word, but it is definitely uncomfortable. My face is definitely smoother, but I am 'aware' of it almost all the time. Just a feeling of...damn I can feel my face...all...the...time. It's kind of weird being 'aware' of your skin.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Review: Mama Bear Soaps</TITLE>
    <DATE>2013-06-10 08:57:57</DATE>
    <TEXT>So after hearing great things here about them I made an order with Mama Bear Soaps. After looking around on the website I decided on the [Vanilla Cream scent](http://mamabearssoaps.com/index.php?main_page=product_info amp;cPath=1_12 amp;products_id=197) 5oz puck in the plastic container ($14.90 total with shipping) and I submitted my order in the wee hours of the morning (approx 3:30 am Pacific Time) on June 5. I received email confirmation that my order had shipped at approx 12:15 (again PST) on June 5. Have to give respect for a company who receives an order and ships it less than 9 hours later!!! I received my package 3 days later on June 8th using the standard shipping option. I had anticipated receiving my soap formed to the plastic container but that was not the case. The puck was wrapped in plastic which I think is customary, and the puck was placed inside the plastic tub. The puck itself was slightly smaller around and slightly taller than the tub itself (the lid of the tub wouldn't fully close because the puck was too tall). This was not a big deal, and I did not mention it in a negative way at all just giving an accurate review. I simply unwrapped the puck, put it in a small glass bowl and tossed it in the microwave and blasted it in 10 second intervals until it completely liquified (about 4 or 5 times if I remember correctly). The soap melted perfectly in the microwave and fully filled the supplied container to the top once I poured it in. Now the description on the website describes this scent as follows: "This is one of the most wonderful vanilla scents I have ever run across. You almost want to take a bite out of the soap, but please don't!" I will have to disagree with this statement, and it is the only negative thing that I have to say about my interactions with the company. The scent is pleasant, but to me does not smell like the vanilla scent I was expecting and certainly doesn't make me want to take a bite out of the puck haha. [The soap lathered beautifully as you can see](http://imgur.com/a/oPToO) The website is easy to navigate, the order process is simple and straight forward, and payment was easy with PayPal. Shipping was phenomenally fast!!! They have certainly earned a repeat customer on that alone! The scent was not as good as I was expecting, but it is pleasant none the less and doesn't linger after the shave. The soap lathers beautifully and provided a very nice slick shave. In hind sight I should've gotten a few samples to test the fragrances first but I was in a hurry to get away from the VDH soap that I had been using and I am satisfied with my purchase. All in all I give the whole experience 4.5 blades out of 5.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I bought a Motorola Droid Razor in December 2011 (right before the Maxx came out) and have absolutely loved it. It was my 1st smartphone so this is not about any kind of OS fanboy crap or anything like that. The screen of my phone is highly reactive, I have never had any kind of screen protector on it, and it has been used and abused for the last 18+ months. After cleaning it today I looked at the screen for the 1st time in awhile and realized that after all this time, there isn't a single scratch, swirl mark, blemish or anything. It is as pristine as the day I bought it. So my question is, why isn't this everywhere? Is it a proprietary thing? A cost thing? Or what?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I think the prescription drug industry in the USA is one of the most corrupted, bloated entities in the country CMV</TITLE>
    <DATE>2013-06-10 11:21:22</DATE>
    <TEXT>I am currently uninsured and have 2 prescription medications that I take daily. If I fill them without any insurance coverage they are $175 and $118.90 (these are both generic brands btw and each are only 30 pills 1/day). If I use my pharmacy's uninsured program plan the costs drop to $28.53 and $43.57 respectively. If I use a random 'free prescription plan' they fall to $13.61 and $14.57 respectively. I just found out that the random 'free prescription plan' that I have been using increased one of them to $43.27 this month and next month my other one will increase to $53 so I will have to go find other 'free' plan to use to keep my costs low. Now I am sure that the store gets incentives from running their own program, but the plethora of 'free prescription plans' are not making money from me at all so I know they aren't 'paying a portion' of my prescription costs. Why can't they just market all the drugs using the lowest available price for everyone instead of making us jump through hoops in order to find the 'magical free plan' that works best for the drugs we take? The answer I believe is because most people don't have the time to hunt down these plans, find the lowest costs, so they end up paying more than the drug is worth because the drug companies know we're going to buy it anyway no matter what they decide to charge for it.

    <TITLE>Thought I had my lather problem figured out...guess not</TITLE>
    <DATE>2013-06-13 07:07:28</DATE>
    <TEXT>Ok so I soak my VDH Boar brush in my bowl filled with hot water, place the bowl in a sink full of hot water and take a shower. Empty the sink and place bowl (still full of water) off to the side while I do my glycerin pre-wash. Do a one splash rinse of the glycerin and dump my bowl. Take the brush directly to my soap (currently Honeybee or Mama Bear) and with the soap bowl turned sideways over the sink vigorously run my brush through the soap until the bubbles turn microscopic. Take the brush to either my lather bowl or my face and start to build lather. I'll build what looks like a nice thick lather and apply to my face (or stop building if attempting face lathering). The 'building process' can take anywhere between 45 seconds to several minutes. The most common problem I have is in either case, the lather on my face just disappears after a few minutes. What is most likely the cause of this? Too much water in my brush when I start? Not enough time spent building? Not enough water (although I don't think this is the problem)? Any advice would be great. I've read all of the posts about brushes and building lather, and feel like I'm doing everything right, but I've only had what I would consider an absolutely perfect lather once or twice.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Question about experiences with Honey Bee Soaps</TITLE>
    <DATE>2013-07-01 08:53:51</DATE>
    <TEXT>Has anyone else had any experiences with this soap at all? I ordered a [3 Piece Variety Set](http://www.honeybeesoaps.net/catalog.php/HoneybeeSoaps/ct/pd1309767/3_piece_Shaving_Soap_Variety_Set) from Honey Bee Soaps (Oakmoss, Vanilla Oak, and Dragon's Blood for those that are interested) and I really REALLY want to love these soaps for the scent alone. They smell absolutely AMAZING and they capture the name of the scent perfectly!!!! Of the 3 I ordered, I would rank them on my personal scale of preference as Dragon's Blood (which I ordered on a fluke simply because I collect dragons), Vanilla Oak, then Oakmoss. I love them all so much and just having them in my bathroom has changed the scent of the room itself. It no longer smells predominantly of my wife's products, now I can constantly smell my soaps and life is good!! The problem I'm running into is the I can't seem to get the soap past the "soap sudsy" stage. I soak my VDH brush in hot (tap) water while showering. Then I use /u/leisureguy's recommended method of holding the soap sideways over the sink and swirl vigorously until the bubbles become microscopic. At first I was stuck on building lather in a bowl, but after only creating what I would consider 1 adequate lather using this method I switched to face lathering and have been much more successful with this method. I can build very good lathers with VDH soap, and [incredible lathers](http://imgur.com/a/oPToO) with Mama Bear soaps, but every time I try to lather with the Honey Bee soaps, it just doesn't build. I get a lot of 'soap' on my face, but not what I would call 'lather'. I use the same technique each time, I've tried loading extra soaps when using the Honey Bee's, adjusted how much water was left in the brush before loading it with soap, adjusted how much, if any, water is added to the brush during the lather process, it just doesn't seem to want to come together for me. Now I know that Mama Bear soaps are a glycerin based soap so that may have something to do with the reason that I'm able to get such a luxurious lather from that brand, but I can also get 'almost' as good lathers using just the regular VDH soap. Anyone else ever had issues with Honey Bee soaps? If other brands are lathering well, in my opinion that negates the need to try a distilled water shave, am I wrong in thinking that? Any other options outside of buying a new brush, which I know that I need to do. I really want to be able to use these soaps that smell really REALLY good, but at this point it feels like I'm wasting the product every time I try to use it because I don't get to enjoy it to its full potential. *Edit for formatting</TEXT>

    <DATE>2013-07-11 07:25:30</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I've heard all the positive reviews of the CO Bigelow/Proraso Green and since I was at the mall today I grabbed a tube at Bath  amp; Body Works, against my better judgment. Took it home and made a practice lather: PSA for noobs - when switching from a soap to a cream do not, I repeat DO NOT, take your soaking wet dripping brush to your cream. It will explode into a huge frothy mess of sudsy uselessness haha. At this point I already knew this product wasn't going to be a good fit for me simply because I didn't enjoy the scent, but I rinsed out my brush and bowl and after putting a small dollop of cream back in the bowl I shook my brush out and went back in again. This time it exploded into a burst of thick delicious looking lather. Even though I knew I wasn't going to shave, had done no prep, and my face was dry as a bone I went ahead and lathered my face up just to see if the feeling of the cooling menthol would be enough for me to overcome the unpleasant scent (personal opinion only) and use the product anyway. Sadly it wasn't. I knew going into the experiment that this product wasn't going to be a good fit for me because I'm not a big fan of menthol, but I wanted to give it a shot anyway. Needless to say I now posses a 1.7 oz tube of cream missing only 2 almond sized amounts of product that I'll never use. If anyone who likes the product would be interested in a trade for a product of similar value (only cost me $5) I'd happily send it out. Thought I'd ask here before taking it to Shave Bazaar.</TEXT>

The thing is, as some of you may remember (look at me making myself sound so important that ya'll remember posts by specific people), I am somewhat of a cologne whore so I need something that is either unscented or VERY lightly scented so that it doesn't clash with whatever cologne I choose to wear on any given day.

    <TEXT>So I was out shopping today and found [this stuff](http://imgur.com/a/a1KWf) at a local Asian Grocery store. There are no ingredients so I'm not sure if it's the potassium alum that I was looking for, but at $1.29 for an 8oz bag of crystals I took a shot. They had an entire box full of these bags so if it's the real deal I know where I'll be running when I need more. My next question is if it is in fact the stuff I'm looking for, I know it can be melted down and formed into the shape of my choosing in an oven. For those of you who have done this, what have you used as a mold? If I remember right from a recent thread you just put it in a 200 degree oven and allow it to melt into your mold then just turn off the oven and let it cool in the oven until it's room temperature to allow the crystals to form right so it will last a long time. Is that correct?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Gillette Tech vs Superspeed</TITLE>
    <DATE>2013-07-24 11:32:16</DATE>
    <TEXT>So when I started wet shaving I picked up a black handle 69 Superspeed locally for $4 and was on my way. A couple of weeks ago I picked up a late 40s model gold Tech ball end for $10 and started using it. Until today, I hadn't put a blade in the Superspeed since I started using the tech. The Tech is absolutely amazing! I can't say enough good things about this razor! The weight is very nice and very balanced. It glides over the skin like butter. If the evidence shown during the rinse didn't show it, I'd never know it was cutting hair. My shaves have never been smoother, cleaner, faster, and irritation free...ever. I can be as aggressive with the blade angle as I want with no consequences and get that BBS shave we all search for way more often then not. I don't think I could cut myself with this razor if I wanted to. I put a blade in the Superspeed for my shave today and went through the same motions I had been doing the past couple of weeks with the tech and ended up with 2-3 nicks and a small cut. Going to fast and not concentrating on blade angle. Also I've got some irritation and way more stubble than I like to have after a shave. All in all the Tech beats the Superspeed in every possible way!</TEXT>

Researching it as best I could I believe it was made around 1916 based on the logo design but if anyone has any more information it would be appreciated including what it might be worth in this restored and shave ready condition. After all the sanding was finished, I made the classic rookie mistake and brought out the dremmel to do the final buff/polish and ended up putting a [small chip in the shaving edge](http://imgur.com/a/qghGB). Sent it out to be repaired/honed and just got it back yesterday. [Here's how it looks today.](http://imgur.com/a/jR1B2) I'm pretty happy with the job I did, and the honing /u/RVmaster did (review to follow in a separate post).</TEXT>

    <TITLE>1st SR Shave and repair/hone review of /u/RVmaster</TITLE>
    <DATE>2013-07-28 06:43:49</DATE>
    <TEXT>After about 2 months of DE shaving, I started down the SR shaving road today and had my 1st SR shave! When I decided to convert from carts I really wanted to start on a SR but the advice given here was to transition to DE 1st and then go SR. After putting a small chip in my blade during the restore process, /u/RVmaster offered to repair it and hone it at a VERY reasonable price. I sent the razor off in the mail on a Friday and it arrived to him on Monday. Within hours of receiving it I received an email from RVmaster showing the repair he had done on the chip and it looked fantastic. Later that evening I received word that the honing was complete and he mailed it back to me the following day. The turn around time was absolutely phenomenal!!! Today I lathered up and with shaking, nervous hands, picked up my SR. My wife, who was watching me, kept giggling because my hands resembled an epileptic attempting surgery. I only did WTG passes on my cheeks, jawline, upper lip, and sides of the neck. I avoided the chin and throat area until I get the technique down and have a steadier hand. There was a fair amount of tugging and pulling during the shave but I attribute that more to nerves and faulty technique than anything to do with the honing done by /u/RVmaster. Given the general consensus of the hanging hair test, I did not do one, but I can attest to the fact that the blade was sharp as hell! My single WTG pass took my beard down closer than a WTG and XTG pass with my DE. When I rinsed, re-lathered, and picked up my DE I was able to skip the XTG pass and go straight to the ATG pass with ease. I am absolutely satisfied with the job that /u/RVmaster did with my razor. He seems knowledgeable about the art, was able to repair the chip without losing too much steel, keeps in contact during the job, had an amazingly fast turn around time, and was very reasonably priced. I would happily recommend him to anyone, and plan to use him again in the future until I can get my own set of stones and start learning to hone myself.

    <TEXT>How many of you find it difficult, if not impossible, to use the same soap or cream 2 days in a row? The variety available in my collection makes it a seem like a waste to use the same one twice in a row and I'm wondering if I'm alone in this. I don't have a specific a then b then c type rotation.

    <TEXT>I'll be receiving my WD poor man strop either tomorrow or the next day and I'm trying to a get a feel for the general consensus on where/how to mount it. I don't have an available towel rack that would be convenient so that is not an option. The main question I have is about mounting height. When pulled taut to strop what is the most comfortable angle. Parallel, downward angle, upward angle? If parallel is best, what is the 'ideal' height? Waist, mid-belly, chest? I have a feeling that this will be a YMMV situation, just trying to get pros and cons and such.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Review of Mystic Water Soaps</TITLE>
    <DATE>2013-07-30 01:33:22</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've seen them recommended here quite often, but haven't read a review about them since I've been here so I thought I'd write one. I ordered the Irish Traveller scent based on the description: "My version of Green Irish Tweed, the House of Creed fragrance created for Cary Grant. It's a spicy-sweet blend with top notes of lemon and French verbena, green middle notes of violet leaves and iris, on a base of Mysore sandalwood and ambergris. As one of my female customers says, "It smells like a good-looking man!" Fragrance oil." I mean seriously, who DOESN'T want to smell like a good looking man?!? I ordered my soap from the main page, and because I can't read I didn't see the many different places she tells you to order single pucks from the sample page for half off shipping. The following morning I got notice that upon receiving my order she immediately refunded my inadvertent overpayment which I thought was awesome customer service. Now onto the soap... As soon as I opened the padded envelope it came in, I could smell the soap. The scent is very strong and powerful. This is by far the most potent scented soap I've tried which I consider a bonus, but I wanted to be clear to others who might enjoy a milder scented soap. The soap arrived shrink wrapped in plastic and inside a plastic tub. This soap is also the softest soap I've ever had as well. It is my 1st tallow soap so I'm not sure if that is a characteristic of tallow soaps in general or just her recipe. After unwrapping the soap I was able to press it into the tub to form it to it using only my fingers. The Irish Traveller scent is very fresh and clean smelling. Much like the original Irish Spring soap, which given the name was what I was expecting. It lathered beautifully with my brand new Simpson Berkely 46 in Best Badger. I probably should've loaded it for just a few more seconds when I used it to shave. I made a couple of practice lathers that were magnificent, but my shave lather fell apart toward the 3rd pass because I didn't load long enough so my lather was a little too wet. All in all I give them the following ratings: Customer Service: 5 out of 5 Scent: 4 out of 5 Lather 4 out of 5 [Mystic Water Soap](http://www.mystic4men.com/) [Obligatory Lather Porn](http://imgur.com/a/PYWgD)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Keeping in mind I would want to use them, not just have them to collect, how would I determine a good price/value on vintage or used brushes? My local store that I've gotten some razors from has quite a few brushes that seem to be in usable condition, but I have no idea on how to price them out. Also I assume I can tell badger from boar pretty easily. Boar hair will have split ends while badger won't. Any other things to consider? Do brush bristles ever become too brittle to save? I've glanced at her inventory quickly but not too thoroughly since I lacked knowledge in what I was looking at. I don't recall seeing names or logos on many, or any of them, so how would I know what they are?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Whipped Dog Quarter Nortons</TITLE>
    <DATE>2013-07-31 23:42:45</DATE>
    <TEXT>So as many of you know I'm just getting into SR shaving/restoring. I am absolutely hooked, and have a feeling every last penny of disposable income I get in the near future is going to end up going toward feeding this new obsession. I've heard a lot of people recommend the quarter nortons from WD as a good budget set of honing stones. Would these typically be ok only for someone who is honing 1 personal razor? Or would they be ok for someone who plans to learn/master the craft, restore razors, and gift/sell them? The price is awesome for a set of stones, but if they are true quarters of normal size stones, I can imagine they are quite small and would thus vastly increase the time needed to hone a dull razor to shave readiness by a factor of 3 or 4. In other words, if you could hone a dull razor to finish with a set of full stones in say an hour (I am just using this as an example, I have no idea how long it actually takes), using stones a quarter of the size might increase that time to 3 or 4 hours due to the loss of usable surface area. Am I right?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So after following up 3 WTG SR shaves with cleanup using my DE, I bit the bullet and went for a 3 pass SR shave today!! It wasn't planned at the beginning of the shave, but I got done with the WTG pass, and suddenly felt that my hand was steady enough to attempt a XTG pass, finished that up without incident and figured, what the hell, and went for a full ATG pass. After reading [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/wicked_edge/comments/1jehyd/just_finished_my_first_ever_straight_razor_shave/cbdyc9s) this morning, and finishing up my 4th SR shave without even a drop of blood at all from any of them I felt [like this!!!!](http://i.imgur.com/V5JwvTY.gif) I'm not gonna lie and say I was BBS, I was far from it. My technique is not strong enough to rival even a 2 pass DE shave yet, but I'm working on it. Rinsed, alumed up, rinsed, then splashed on some witch hazel and [HOLY SHIT!!!!](http://i.imgur.com/NgBRGni.gif) Just cause there ain't blood doesn't mean you were flawless lmao!!</TEXT>

    <DATE>2013-08-02 23:31:08</DATE>
    <TEXT>For the past couple of years I have been wanting to open my own business. I spent a lot of time and effort on one idea for a brick and mortar store only to have those dreams shattered when an identical store open less than 400 yards from the location I had in mind for mine just as I was starting to get the financing together to open mine. Because the location for my store was a major selling point for investors, and the community not having the ability to support another store of the same type I moved on from that idea. I've been looking for something I can pour myself into, something that will appeal to my mechanical and technical mind, give me a sense of accomplishment, and something that I can get great enjoyment from and I just recently realized what this is! A while back I discovered the old style of shaving using Double Edge safety razors and making your own shaving lather with a brush and a puck of soap (shaving like your Grandpa used to shave). I immediately fell in love with this art, and it didn't take me long to transition to using a Straight Razor so I bought a vintage razor at a local antique store and spent about half a day bringing it back to life and I got a lot of enjoyment out of the process. I have always been drawn to knives in general, there was just something utilitarian about them and I can't remember a time over the last 20 years where I didn't have a knife on me all the time. Something about the way a tool can have such a simplistic design, be so useful in so many different ways, and if made by a talented blacksmith with a passion for design can be so breathtakingly beautiful. I would love to learn this art and begin designing my own style of straight razors and I need your help to make this dream come true! Although generally speaking, the equipment that I need to acquire in order to start on this is not expensive on their own, buying it all at once is going to be quite costly. I also want to start an online store to showcase my razors and sell a vast assortment of shaving products including Double Edge razors, razor blades, shaving brushes, soaps and creams, and necessary products to maintain shaving equipment. A non-inclusive short list of some of the equipment I need is: *Forge *Anvil *Various blacksmith tools (hammers, tongs, chisels, punches, etc) *Knife grinder *Band saw *Drill Press *Wood Lathe *Honing Stones *Store Inventory I need your support in this endeavor, please help me become the master of this craft that I know I have the ability to become!

    <TEXT>I want to start smithing!!! Specifically I want to make straight razors and eventually knives, although working in the opposite direction would probably be smarter. I created a GoFundMe campaign with dreams of getting help setting up my equipment, but I am not holding my breath or counting on it to succeed in order to move forward. You can see my /r/assistance post [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/1jl9jg/help_gofund_my_new_startup_and_receive_products) and my GoFundMe campaign [here](http://www.gofundme.com/riffraffrazors) The equipment that I plan to get/build is: [This Forge](http://zoellerforge.com/firebrickforge2.html) [This No Weld Grinder](http://www.mickleyknives.com/html/no_weld_grinder.html) I think [this anvil](http://www.harborfreight.com/garage-shop/anvils/55-lb-rugged-cast-iron-anvil-69161.html) will suit my needs but I'm a little concerned over the weight, but from the research I've done it should be fine as long as I secure it to something sturdy so it doesn't jump around on me. I'm thinking a good sized stump with a rubber mat underneath. I know I'll need standard blacksmith tools (hammers, tongs, safety gear, hardy tools, large magnet, etc) I plan to use a toaster oven for heat treating and tempering, or is a kiln a better idea? I'll need a standard band saw and drill press for making scales and handles. I also know I'll need buckets and oil, water, sand, etc for quenching and annealing. Is there anything I'm missing or over looking? I haven't even struck my 1st hammer blow and I can already feel this addiction creeping over me like a tidal wave!!!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I believe that without a unified organized revolution carried out by the citizens of this country, the United States will crumble within my lifetime (I'm 36). Please CMV!!!</TITLE>
    <DATE>2013-08-17 08:30:21</DATE>
    <TEXT>I will 1st explain my interactions with the government to give some insight into my knowledge of the government. I spent 10 years on active duty with the US Military immediately followed by 5 years as a Federal Law Enforcement Officer with the US Forest Service. I love my country and have dedicated nearly my entire adult life to supporting and defending the Constitution that makes us great. I will admit to being largely uninformed, and honestly uninterested, about the inner workings of the government for most of my life and up until this last presidential election I had never voted in any election be it local, state, or presidential ever. I held the opinion that politicians were dishonest, disloyal, and their actions bordered on the criminal, and because I never saw a candidate that I felt earned or deserved my vote, they weren't going to get it. I still feel that way about politicians, but I realized that "you must be the change you want to see in the world" and that by remaining silent (by not voting) I had no right to complain about the disarray I felt the government is in. I am going to try to keep the party of my choice from coming out so this doesn't turn into a party politics circle jerk, but it may be difficult. On the other hand, I firmly believe in certain "hot topic" stances from both sides of the isle so it might not be so prevalent after all. Before I get much further (this will most likely be a Great Wall of China sized wall of text by the time I'm through) I want to explain what I meant when I said revolution in the title. I don't necessarily mean armed conflict or civil war, although it may come to that. I mean revolution in the purest sense of the word. The citizens of this country coming together in spite of political party affiliations and outright demanding our government makes the changes necessary in order to return us to a country whose government is of the people, by the people, and for the people. I would like to think this could happen peacefully, but if it requires armed conflict so be it. I'll start with money as it is the root of all evil in this world (I'm only half joking with that statement). The US debt currently stands at [16.9 TRILLION dollars](http://www.usdebtclock.org/) and the Federal Government budget has an annual deficit of [792 BILLION dollars](http://www.usdebtclock.org/). No rational person can make the claim that this amount of debt can be paid off...ever. No rational person can make the claim that an annual deficit of this amount is sustainable for any length of time. Those of us who work and slave for a living and live paycheck to paycheck know that debt is crippling and when the debt collector comes calling we can lose everything. The amount of debt we're in, and the deficit we run our government under is common knowledge, hell we're almost proud of it. The entire world knows it, and sooner or later they are going to act on it. Debt makes us weak as a country, it makes our money lose value, and our commitments worthless to a point. I feel at some point in the not so distant future one of two things, or both, are going to happen. Either the countries of the world are going to collectively stop lending us money, or they are going to call in their debt...probably both at the same time, and at that point we're done. We will crumble financially under our own bloated system. I'll move on to jobs. As someone who has been unemployed for the better part of 2 years, I can say that in the area I live in, unless you want to make $8/hour in the service industry, there are very few jobs available. I am married and have 4 children and $8/hour wouldn't cover the gas to get to work and rent in my 3 bedroom 900 sq-ft duplex. I am not one of those people who believe it is the government's job to create jobs, that is not in the government's area of responsibilities (although you wouldn't think that with [3% of the American workforce employed by the government](http://www.usdebtclock.org/)). The greatest buzz word used when discussing employment is outsourcing, which I believe is one of the most despicable things an American company can do, but I understand why they do it. Without doing an ounce of research to back up my claim, I'm going to go out on a limb and say that we as a country have probably automated ourselves out of an equal or greater number of living wage providing manufacturing jobs then have been lost to outsourcing. It's just the nature of manufacturing. If a machine can do the work faster, more efficiently, and cheaper than a person, it makes business sense to do so, but that doesn't help us out as a nation and I don't know if there's a realistic way to reverse the trend with new technology being developed daily. I will give an example of another way we lose jobs that I have 1st hand knowledge of the government partly blocking employment and that is with the logging industry. Thousands of acres of National Forests burn every year due to both natural and human caused fires. The timber that is left in the wake of these fires are usually dead as far as living trees go, but can be incredibly useful as lumber and other products produced from wood. The timber is out there, ready to be harvested, cleared, and replanted and logging companies want it. The problem is the EPA and certain activist groups fight the logging companies and make them jump through endless and unnecessary hoops in order to get the permits to harvest the wood. By the time the hoops have been jumped through and the court battles fought (typically years down the road), the timber is now dead, rotten, and useless and the logging companies, rightfully so, don't want to pay people to go clear the land and replant because they won't see any profit from the worthless wood. This means a loss to a very large number of good paying jobs not just from the people who actually harvest the wood, but also the people who transport it, process it at lumber yards, and then again transport it to customers. I am quite certain that this isn't the only industry plagued by stories like this, but it's the only one I have 1st hand knowledge in. I'm not sure how or if that plays into this CMV topic, but I wanted to put it out there anyway as a way of saying that there are jobs to be had, but they aren't being given the opportunity to be offered due to bureaucracy and red tape. Bill of Rights. There are several glaring red flags when it comes to the rights of the people in recent history. * 2nd Amendment-Having spent 10 years defending the Constitution I find it appalling that a large portion of the population of this country are not only willing to give up this right, but actively working toward doing just that as a knee jerk reaction with the uninformed belief that gun control will stop gun violence. Even if it would (which I don't believe it can), I still couldn't/wouldn't support such a movement. An unarmed populace has zero chance of defending themselves or revolting against the government should that government suddenly shift and become tyrannical against the populace. The whole purpose of the 2nd Amendment was to provide the citizens (not the "country") the ability to defend themselves from all enemies both foreign AND domestic. The Constitution was written at a time when we as a nation had just gone to war against our own government and fought tooth and nail for our freedom. If anyone thinks that the possibility does not exist (however slight) that this kind of action may not being required again in the future is partially delusional. * 4th Amendment-The fact that we as a nation have not stood up in revolt against things like The Patriot Act, the NSA/Snowden scandal, illegal searches of electronic devices by law enforcement, and other gross violations of the 4th Amendment baffles me. I witnessed questionable acts and tactics by fellow officers when I was in law enforcement and I was eventually fired from my job. I can't prove that I was fired for "rocking the boat", but I saw glaring violations of people's rights and reported them and I'm no longer a cop and the offending officers are so take that how you would like. * 6th Amendment-"In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial". When was the last time any nationally known crime was handled in a speedy way? Granted, the delay is largely at the agreement of the accused, but this results in trial by media long before a trial by jury can be found which makes an impartial jury impossible to find. * 10th Amendment-"The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people." This Amendment has been trampled on to the point where it basically no longer exists in the Federal Government. Party politics. I feel that the Democratic and Republican party are 2 heads of the same monster. They exist only to polarize the citizens against each other, and keep the populace blind to what is really going on. Every day there are debates on blogs, message boards, newspapers, talk radio, and the media in general about party politics and which one is responsible for the mess this country is in. I feel they are both responsible, because they are both the same. They may not support the same principles, but they are the same in that they are both far more interested in garnering more power for their party then they are in doing what is best for this country. Both parties obstruct the other at every single opportunity just to spite the other party. What is the best move to make takes a back seat to not compromising or giving the other party a "win". It is much more important to keep the other side from doing anything than to risk allowing the other side to make a difference. I basically feel that the US Government has become an entity that serves itself 1st, the people who fund elections campaigns 2nd, Foreign interests 3rd, and "the people" a distant 4th (and that's being generous). I feel that "the people" have lost control of the country due to ignorance (like myself), misinformation, and manipulation by the governing body, and without a total revolt against the government, we will crumble under the weight of a bloated self serving government. Please change my view and put some of my faith back in this country!!!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>99 Suburban stalled and died on the highway</TITLE>
    <DATE>2013-10-06 06:48:10</DATE>
    <TEXT>Ok so I've got a 1999 Suburban LS 4x4 with the 5.7 and only 109k miles on it. I just got it less than 2 weeks ago from a reputable dealer in trade for my 02 silverado (needed a bigger vehicle now that my kids outgrew the backseat of the truck). Yesterday I had to take it into the dealership for them to repair the A/C that they agreed to fix when we bought it. When I went out and started it there was a horribly bad rattle coming from the undercarriage. Told the mechanics about it when we got to the shop and we both chalked it up to a broken hanger on the exhaust pipe (sounded good at the time and the sound matched the explanation). The rattle was gone by the time we got to the shop so we couldn't duplicate it and it didn't return when we picked it back up so I put it out of my mind. My wife took it to a business meeting today 60 miles from the house and right as she was getting into the city things went massively wrong. This is the story as she tells it. She had the cruise control set at 55 mph and she said it kicked off right as the exhaust started blowing a huge cloud of black smoke, it started chugging and then died as she was driving. She got it pulled off the side of the road and called me. She tried to start it as I was on the phone and it would turn over but not start so I drove out to her (thankfully we have a 2nd car). When I got there I tried to start it and it fired right up but the rattle was back and the Service engine soon light was on (which had never been on previously). I crawled underneath it to investigate the rattle and saw 2 cats on the exhaust. Laying on my back and looking up there was 1 cat close to me and another one just to the rear of the vehicle and tucked up higher than the front one. The front one (which comes from the driver's side of the engine) was shaking like an epileptic having a seizure and sounded like it had marbles rolling around inside of it. With the vehicle off I can smack that cat and hear things rattling around inside it, the other cat does not mimic this. I figured "ok the cat blew apart on the inside and it's done". I was able to limp it to a Pep Boys that was a couple of blocks away and they read the codes for me. It came back with a MAF sensor fault and a multiple cylinder misfire fault (didn't see the actual fault code numbers) but nothing cat related which absolutely shocked me. I pulled the MAF out and one of the guys cleaned it for me and we put it back in and I took it for a spin around the block. The rattle was back (no shock there) but it wasn't as bad. The service engine light was now gone but the truck ran like crap. It was chugging and sluggish and after goosing the gas a little on a side street it died when I stopped at a stop sign. Started back up again and drove it back to Pep Boys and parked it. I find it hard to believe that the MAF sensor would cause all of these problems but hey stranger things have happened. Pep Boys wanted $375 to replace the sensor but I know that I can get the part cheaper elsewhere and replace it myself in 5 minutes. They said I can do that and they'd reset the computer and codes for $45. Is that my best bet? I'm trying to avoid having to pay for a tow 60+ miles back home. Can anyone give me some advice?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Feeling depressed, demoralized, and completely frustrated at my situation</TITLE>
    <DATE>2013-10-12 00:49:02</DATE>
    <TEXT>I don't know what I'm doing wrong, if anything, but I have been looking for work for over 3 months. I have expressed interest in or applied for nearly 200 different positions and for my effort have scored 4 call backs, 2 interviews, and zero offers. I was active duty US Navy from 98 through 07 in an aviation electronics field. After my honorable discharge I took a position as a law enforcement officer with a government agency where I worked until 2011 (on paper). I was terminated without proper cause in Nov 11 and through my Union fought my termination for the next year. In Dec of '12 I accepted a settlement deal that included a monetary payout and required me to resign my position effective the date of my termination and given a letter of service to provide proof of employment. So I was unemployed for a year before being in a position where I actually 'needed' to look for work. I applied at a few places during that time, but as soon as they learned of my situation, that I was in a legal battle to get my old job back, they understandably passed on me as an employee. In Feb of '13 I bought into a partnership with an existing local tow company (although I had no experience in the field) and opened my own satellite branch operating under his business name and license. I sunk everything I had into this business; money, time, effort, everything. After 6 months of operations, and making exactly $80 (not $80 profit...$80 total) I closed the branch in Aug due to having no more money to pay the bills. Part of the reason behind my failure is lack of knowledge in the business and trying to 'build a name' in an area that was already flooded with competition, and part of the reason was lack of research on my business partner who in the long run failed to deliver on specific promises made (verbally not in writing) prior to signing a deal that severely limited my ability to be successful. TL:DR On paper I've been out of work for the last 2 months, plus a span of time from Nov 2011 through Feb 2013. I have management/supervision experience from my time at the tow company plus being the head of a 23 member work center while in the military. I have detailed report/paperwork experience from my time as a law enforcement officer. I have technical/electronics experience from my time in the military. What am I doing wrong that I keep getting overlooked when applying for positions? I've applied for everything from menial minimum wage positions to manager/assistant manager positions in everything from office settings to retail settings. Unfortunately the area that I live in has very few manufacturing/industrial jobs and the majority of the positions are somehow tied to the service industry. Any help, advice, or anything else would be greatly appreciated. I will also provide the various resumes that I use (highlighting different portions of experience depending on the type of position I'm applying for) in order to see if there is something wrong with my resume. Help me Reddit, you're my only hope...(ok bad Star Wars reference) EDIT TO ADD RESUMES* [This is the resume that I have used most often](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B7giJwVlgx-zYXJURVg2TGNlNWs/edit?usp=sharing) [This is the resume that I created about a week ago and began using](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B7giJwVlgx-zVkJ0UFZOaDAzZlk/edit?usp=sharing) [This is the resume that I wrote today after researching here and on /r/resumes](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B7giJwVlgx-zclFCdlVEWXFWdkk/edit?usp=sharing)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>How Did I Do?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2013-10-17 05:47:06</DATE>
    <TEXT>Ok so [this job posting](http://i.imgur.com/SmRbdj8.jpg) popped up in my area today. I have been out of work for all intents and purposes for over 2 years (less on paper). I sent my resume attached to the following email. How did I do? Too much? __________________________________________________________ I read your posting for an Administrative Assistant several times trying to find a portion of it that did not specifically request one of my many talents. After several readings I have come to the conclusion that the person who wrote it had me in mind when they drafted it. My skills and abilities align perfectly with the person you are looking for. I have experience creating and giving presentations (written, verbal, and Power Point). I am very detail oriented and demand nothing but perfection from myself when submitting reports, spreadsheets, and other paperwork. I am a well trained team player who is skilled in the art of multi-tasking. My ability to juggle multiple projects while prioritizing the work in order to ensure it all gets completed on or before a deadline, all while helping other team members as needed is unsurpassed. My years of law enforcement and military service have given me an eye for safety and the ability to act/react to any situation with sound judgment and a level head. It has also imparted in me the ability to both lead AND follow, make decisions, and take direction as needed. I understand that it may seem like an Administrative Assistant would be below my qualification level, but I would disagree. I believe it would be the perfect opportunity for me to get my foot in the door and learn the goals and business of the company in order for me to move up as my performance dictates. I have a clean criminal and DMV record, can pass even the most extensive drug screen if required, and I am available to start immediately. If there is anything that I can do to clarify any information contained in my resume please don't hesitate to reach out to me via email or phone. Contact me as soon as you can to schedule an interview, I assure you that if you allow another company to snag me up, you will continually ask yourself 'where would we be now if we had hired subject807 when we had the chance?'. I look forward to hearing from you! Respectfully,</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've been without a dependable income for over 2 years. I've been effectively unemployed for going on 3 months. I have been marketing myself to the absolute best of my ability with zero results. At this point I am applying for, and willing to take, ANY job that comes with a paycheck regardless of how 'beneath' my experience level it may be. I have 15 years of highly technical electronics experience, 5 years of supervisory experience, and 5 years of federal law enforcement experience and I'm applying for 'office assistant', 'general warehouse grunt work', hell I applied at Taco Bell. I have taken (and failed) personality assessments to work at cell phone companies as a salesman, work for cable/dish companies as an installer, and other general customer service jobs. I just saw a job posting on Craigslist "seeking a full time, long-term Research and Data Entry Clerk. This position requires the ability to conduct internet research and enter data into a spreadsheet." Starting pay was $10/hr and here's the kicker "Applicants must have a Bachelor's Degree from a Four Year University." I mean seriously? A Bachelor's Degree for a data entry position that is barely above minimum wage? For those of you with a bachelor's Degree, would you even be interested in a position like this? I got a 60 day eviction notice last night, I'm stealing my neighbor's wifi since my internet, phone, and cable were shut off over the weekend, my electricity is about to be shut off because I'm $1,900 behind on my bill, and my checking account is over $300 in the hole. I am so frustrated that I can't even get a call back on a menial minimum wage job, much less something within the boundaries of my experience. Life sucks. /End Rant thanks for reading.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I got a "Try Out"!!!</TITLE>
    <DATE>2013-10-24 06:16:11</DATE>
    <TEXT>So last night I found a job posting for a "Front desk/receptionist" position with a company that I knew. This company installed and serviced all the radio and communication equipment in my patrol vehicle when I was with Law Enforcement. At one point I was on a first name basis with all of their install techs and a few of the front office people. Right before I left my law enforcement job they went through a restructuring and swapped out quite a few of the front office people. So anyway, I sent in my resume in response to the receptionist position last night, but made it a point to highlight my 10 years of electronics experience from my Navy days, my knowledge of the company, and my experience using the products they provide in the field in the hopes that those qualities would make me a good candidate to be able to answer questions, liaise with LE agencies, and help 'sell' the company to prospective clients. I got a call at 9 am this morning asking if I could come in for an interview at 2 this afternoon. Of course I absolutely JUMPED at the chance. I arrived 15 minutes early and the interview began. From the onset of the interview they were concentrating on my electronics experience and I knew right away that what I had REALLY hoped would happen had in fact happened. I was not interviewing for the front desk position, I was interviewing for a service technician position. Within 10 minutes into the interview I discovered that the person interviewing me was not only prior Navy just like me, but he held the exact same title and rank (2nd Class Aviation Electronics Technician) as I did and left the Navy 2 years before me. Needless to say that led to an immediate bond and camaraderie, I instantly relaxed because I knew that he would understand the military jargon that can be hard to translate to the civilian world when it comes to training, experience, etc. Well I absolutely NAILED the interview and he told me to report at 8 am Monday morning to work "for a few days" to make sure that I'm a good fit, both for them and for me, and if all goes well they'll bring me on full time (under a 90 day probationary period which I think is pretty standard). As a bonus, the position I secured pays 50% more than the position I actually applied for. SUCCESS!!!! Time to brush up on my electronics theory and RF Propagation that I haven't used in over 6 years. For all of those still looking, keep up the hunt, and don't forget to work your networks!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>White smoke from exhaust and low oil pressure</TITLE>
    <DATE>2013-11-03 06:24:35</DATE>
    <TEXT>99 Suburban LS 4x4 with the 5.7 with 109k miles. OK so my Suburban broke down on my wife a few weeks ago, figured out that one of the catalytic converters had a catastrophic failure and came apart internally. I cut the cat off so that I could drive it the 60 miles home to save on the tow charge. Had the cat replaced two days ago and now I'm blowing white smoke out the tailpipe like I'm 007 throwing a smoke screen. The smoke alternates from smelling really rich to smelling like oil (pre-burn). The oil pressure gauge is reading at or below 20 PSI and randomly (usually while braking or stopped) completely bottoms out to zero and the "Check Gauge" light comes on. Once I give it some gas and get going again the pressure comes back up to the ~20 psi range. I know cluster gauges aren't known for their accuracy but I also know this isn't 'normal' behavior. I also hear noise from the engine (possibly valves/lifters sticking but could also be more of a knocking sound than a clicking one). Both oil and coolant were full at the time. Also, and possibly unrelated, my coolant temp gauge is totally inoperative and is just bottomed out no matter how warm the engine is. The coolant hoses (supply and return) are warm/hot to the touch at running temp so I'm sure coolant is circulating. What's the easiest way to check whether that issue is the gauge itself, the thermostat, or the sending unit? There are no codes that come up on my OBD II reader at the moment. I did an oil/filter change today and the oil looked good (no water/coolant/etc in it) and changed the oil pressure sending unit and I'm still seeing fluctuating oil pressure readings on the gauge. I don't have a mechanical gauge atm so I'll have to go get one tomorrow to check the actual pressure compared to what the dash gauge reads. I did a compression check today to check the piston rings/head gasket and it looked good. I got between 100-120 psi off the 1st rotation and 180 psi by the 4th rotation on all 8 cylinders. What is my next step?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>'99 Suburban 1500, 5.7L 4wd - Oil pressure problems+white smoke</TITLE>
    <DATE>2013-11-19 06:22:55</DATE>
    <TEXT>Ok so my suburban is killing me! I just got this thing in trade for my truck and thought I got a good deal. It's a 99 with 109,000 miles on it, body and interior is in immaculate condition and I have NEVER seen an engine compartment so clean on a 14 year old vehicle. Got it 'as is' with no warranty so please don't suggest taking it back to the dealer, I've been down that road and it's not an option. About a month after having it, it broke down on my wife at the tail end of a ~60 mile trip. It just died on her on the highway. I went up to see what the problem was and discovered that the catalytic converter coming off of the driver side of the engine (2 cats installed) had fouled and then come apart internally. It had also thrown a MAF sensor fault, a Cam Position sensor fault, and a multiple misfire fault code that were read and erased at Pep Boys (I can't remember the exact codes off the top of my head). I cut the cat off in the parking lot of Pep Boys and drove it the 60 miles back home and parked it. While driving it home I noticed that the oil pressure gauge was bottoming out to zero whenever I took my foot off the gas or came to a stop. As soon as I gave it gas it would come back up again. I had never seen that before, but had also never driven a vehicle without any back-pressure before so I wasn't certain the 2 weren't related. Took it to the shop and had the cat replaced and when my wife was driving it home noticed it was blowing white smoke (after the time it should have stopped from the new cat breaking in about ~20 miles) and she also noticed the oil pressure problem. I started trouble shooting and have done all of the following: * Changed oil pressure sending unit and got the same results * Installed a mechanical oil pressure gauge to verify problem wasn't with the dash gauge, it confirmed bad oil pressure * Did a compression check and all 8 cylinders are getting ~100-110psi off the first rotation and maxing out at ~200-210psi * Dropped the oil pan (Holy crap what a pain in the ass!!) to check for a clogged pick-up tube * Rebuilt the oil pump since I was already in there just in case (new gears, pressure relief valve/spring, shaft retaining sleeve) * Verified that the supply and return lines coming off the oil filter housing were not clogged (blowing through them showed no restriction) Put it all back together and started it up. Had great oil pressure on the cold start (~20-30psi at idle) but as the engine got up to temperature the oil pressure just dropped until it was at zero again. When given gas the pressure will rise, but as soon as I take my foot off the accelerator it just plummets. It is also still blowing white smoke out of the exhaust and the exhaust smells really rich which I know is almost always unburned fuel and it's also throwing a P1345 cam position sensor code. I don't have an air compressor so I can't do a leak down test, but I really don't think I have a blown gasket or cracked head. The oil looks 'normal', no chocolate milk looking oil and no 'waxy' buildup on the inside of the oil fill cap. What is my next step, please help?????</TEXT>

    <DATE>2014-01-08 08:56:53</DATE>
    <TEXT>I just completed my 2nd month of employment after being unemployed for over 2 years. Great news right? I wouldn't fault you for thinking that. In October I made the decision to get rid of the truck I had owned for nearly 10 years. The gas mileage was killing us and the 4 kids had outgrown the backseat. I took it to a reputable local dealer and drove off with an SUV that was a few years older than my truck but had unbelievably low miles plus some cash. I took the cash and bought a sedan for running errands and going to work (once I got a job) off of Craigslist. As can be imagined during long periods of unemployment, I got behind on all of my bills, the most important of which were rent, power and trash. The weekend before I started my new job the suv broke down, and the day I started my power was shut off. The only course of action I had at the time was to get a title loan against the suv so I got 3k. It cost 300 to fix the vehicle, 1,850 to turn the power back on, and I gave the rest to my rental company as part of the back I owe them. That was mid-november. Since that time, the suv has broken down again (worn main and rod bearings at a minimum), the car has broken down (broken cam shaft), I still owe 2,900 to the power company, my trash hasn't been picked up in 2 months, I'm 10 days late on the payment for the title loan on the suv, and I received a "pay or vacate" notice from my rental company a few hours ago informing me that I'll be evicted if I don't pay the entire back balance (1,750) in the next 3 days (I just gave them 875 on the 2nd which is my normal rent and equalled 90% of my most recent paycheck). I currently have $13 in my bank account and I don't know what I'm going to do.</TEXT>

If I have a 200W 2 channel amplifier that I use to power the 2 rear speakers would that make it 160W per speaker? But doing that I'm using the RCA jacks on the head unit, what rating does that have? Is the 240W head unit actually 5 channels because of the RCA jacks? And about amps...if a 400W 4 channel is bridged to 2 channels does that put 200W per channel instead of 100 split between 4 channels?</TEXT>

    <DATE>2014-03-03 08:52:56</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I finally upgraded my kitchen today and bought myself 2 20" cast iron skillets (Lodge brand from Walmart but hey I'm on a budget). I know they claim to come pre-seasoned but I doubt it's "up to snuff" so to speak so I plan to season them properly before using them. I bought 2 48oz packages of bacon ends and pieces in order to use the fat from them to season the skillets. My question is, I also bought a 7.5lb pot roast that I plan to cook for dinner tomorrow. I was trying to think of something to do with all this delicious meat candy I'll be frying during the seasoning process and I had the thought of just throwing some of it in (what I don't scarf down myself haha) with the Pot Roast as it's cooking in the crock pot. Is there a downside to this idea that anyone can think of? Aside from the loss of bacon to eat lol. Also, on the seasoning of the cast iron my plan is to fry up half a package of the bacon in each of the skillets getting them nice and greasy, pouring the grease into something to save it and wipe it down with a paper towel so it's not dripping and placing them in the oven upside down at 400F for about an hour...letting them cool....then repeat...possibly a couple of times. Sound about right?</TEXT>

While filling out the paperwork for the dentist she disclosed that she has a mitrovalve prolapse (Sp?). After seeing that, the dentist required her to get a "release" from her cardiologist (who she has seen a grand total of one time WELL over a year ago) before they would do the extractions. She contacted the cardiologist to get the release and was told by his office that he "doesn't sign those kind of forms and that the dentist should just follow the ADA guidelines". After relaying that information to the dentist they responded "well the ADA guidelines say that we can't do the extraction without the form signed" and promptly cancelled her appointment. So now my wife has to suffer because the sue happy populace of the United States has made it nearly impossible for some people to get the treatment they need cause doctors are too chicken shit to accept the liability for doing their damn job.

I'm sure that someone will suggest just pulling the hard drive and it will boot to tails automatically, but I'm not ready for that step yet. I still need the laptop for now and just want to play with tails to gain experience. So is there any other way besides F12 (or equivalent) at boot that I can change the boot priority?</TEXT>

I would like to limit the discussion strictly to art that can be viewed because I believe music is an art form but that would bring freedom of speech into play and I want to limit it strictly to freedom of expression. I made the following statements during that thread * There is no legitimate reason to ban such "artwork" other than to infringe on other people's preferences. * If a person wanted to draw a picture of Jesus Christ fisting Mohammad while he fucked a 4 year old girl who was in the process of blowing a horse...they should be able to do that without fear of jail OR WORSE death like has happened recently. [In regards to recent cases of beheadings for drawing pictures of Mohammad] * In my humble opinion you cannot be both outraged at that incident [Muhammad beheading] AND attempt to censor someone Else's drawings at the same time. [challenging OPs stance that lolicon should be treated like child pornography and be banned] * I am not defending pedophilia here, I am defending the freedom of expression and the inherent right in all of us to take an image out of our head, no matter how offensive, obscene, demented, etc it may be and put it down on a piece of paper. If you can't do that, you are not free. I am open to any and all of these points being challenged and changed. For clarification on the sensitive subject of child pornography, I am also open to my views being changed that a drawn or animated image of underage children engaging in sexual activity is not child pornography unless the drawing resembles an actual person. For example: In my second bullet point a fictional 4 year old girl that the artist created in their mind would be fine, assuming for the sake of this discussion only that the other 2 characters are fictional as well, but a representation of the artists daughter or a celebrity or any other actual child would be child pornography. Edit: Since this discussion has become focused solely on the child pornography aspect of my post I find it necessary to clarify something. In some of my responses here I have taken on the role of the artist for the sake of discussion. I am not a lolicon artist or a consumer of this type of art, but I stand firmly in support of their right to create it.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2015-02-21 01:18:56</DATE>
    <TEXT>My wife just had her 4th surgery in 14 days on her back. 2 weeks ago yesterday (Thursday) my wife underwent surgery for a neuro stimulator implant. She came out of that surgery numb in both legs from the hip down. She went back in that same night to check for a hematoma on the spine. There was no obvious reasons for the numbness so she closed up. Saturday she was taken back in for surgery because her symptoms are getting worse and she had more than 2 instances of incontinence and the leads for the stimulator were removed from the spine and coiled near the battery. During all of these surgeries the surgeon was removing bone and scar tissue from the spine (an attempt to implant a year ago was removed due to a staph infection at the implant site so there was scar tissue from that). She was allowed to rest/heal to see if the numbness went away as the swelling from surgery healed. Yesterday (14 days after initial surgery) she was taken back in and over the course of the surgery my wife elected to just have everything removed and an MRI was ordered [here are the results of the MRI] ( http://imgur.com/pC0b60C) and after googling myelomalacia I'm incredibly worried. Am I overreacting to that statement in Impression 1?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>CMV: If you have been making more than $2,000,000/yr for more than 5 years (or amassed a liquid net worth in excess of $10,000,000) and you are still working, you are an asshole and you are the problem with the economy in the US</TITLE>
    <DATE>2015-03-03 22:05:37</DATE>
    <TEXT>Full disclosure: I have been unemployed since 2011 so I might be a little jaded, but that does not mean my view can't be changed. I would also like to say up front that I am only talking about positions in the actual work force. In other words celebrities, athletes, etc. aren't included because there is a different dynamic involved with where their income comes from. I believe that if you have earned enough money to have an amount greater than $10,000,000 in liquid assets, and you are older than 40, then you should retire so someone below you can move up the ladder. That amount of money would provide $166,000/year for 60 years without taking interest into account. The workplace exists to stabilize society. By that I mean people need things, they also need money to buy those things, so they make the things other people need. When working correctly everyone contributes and everyone benefits. What we have now is not working and I think greed is the biggest reason why. The most common response I've heard or seen when discussing income is "there's enough money for everyone, you just have to go get it". My response to that is: No there isn't. This statement assumes an infinite supply of money. Governments like to pretend there is, that's why they just keep printing more, but there isn't. Once you've amassed enough money to provide yourself with a comfortable life you should step down and let someone else take your place. If you want to make more money you could gamble on the stock market or go somewhere else and start at the bottom and work your way back up again, you've already demonstrated you have what it takes to succeed. The workplace is stagnant because nobody ever retires anymore until they become too feeble to continue working, and at that point, what the fuck is the point of having 162 bazillion dollars in the bank. The only trip up I have with my own stance involves the original owner of a business. It's a little grey because yes, they did start a company and build it from the ground up and it's kind of their "baby" in a sense. On the other hand, once you start providing a service to the public, does your business really belong to you anymore? Or does it belong to the society it serves... There's nothing stopping that owner from starting another business if they wanted to earn more, they've already proven they have what it takes and have learned lessons the hard way that they won't make the second time around.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2015-03-19 18:22:06</DATE>
    <TEXT>I would like some clarification on the appropriate "safe" length of a tattoo session. I got my 1st tattoo 20 years ago so I'm not new to "the club" so to speak and I was told (or read somewhere) that a tattoo session that lasted longer than 3-4 hours was bad practice because the skin was too traumatized after that point and the likelihood of problems increases exponentially after that time frame. As I said, I can't remember where this little bit of info came from but it was relayed as basically "any artist that suggests or offers to do a session longer than that is a bad artist because they are damaging the skin". Now I understand that longer sessions are becoming increasingly more common (the 9 hour session tattoo posted yesterday for example), and are even showcased on the "reality" tattoo competition shows on TV, but I want to know how much (if any) credibility the information I've believed (without questioning) for 20 years has. Is there any truth to my beliefs?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>My wife's horror story</TITLE>
    <DATE>2015-03-28 08:22:59</DATE>
    <TEXT>In May of 2008 my wife (at the time 30, 5'1, 118 lb) had a lateral release performed on her left leg to correct a misaligned knee cap. After the surgery the surgeon put a hip to ankle immobilizer on her leg with strict instructions not to remove it before seeing him at the follow up appointment which was 5-7 days out. Something happened on the day of the follow up appt, but for whatever reason we had to reschedule the appointment and the next available one was 7 days out. The day before that appointment the office called to reschedule the appointment for the following week because the surgeon had to leave town unexpectedly. All in all she was in hip to ankle immobilizer 24/7 for ~21 days by the time it was removed. When the doctor took it off her thigh muscle had very visibly atrophied and she had lost ~65-70% mobility in her knee (had about ~15 degree movement in either direction from 90 she described as a mechanical block not a pain threshold stop) and constant pain in her knee. PT helped initially but she plateaued after 2-3 weeks. The surgeon perform 2 more laproscopic surgeries between Aug and Oct trying to locate the source of the problems before basically saying that there was nothing more he could do for her and referred her to a pain specialist. Novemberish? 2008 Ultimately it was determined that she had Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy (RSD, now called Complex Regional Pain Syndrome or CRPS) in her left knee. Spring 2009 Her right knee had always had the same problem that she initially had with her left knee, and due to her awkward gait and atrophy her right knee deteriorated to the point of requiring surgery as well. Went to a different surgeon who successfully performed the surgery, but a side effect from the surgery was that the RSD migrated to that leg as well. RSD is usually caused by trauma whether that trauma be accidental or surgical so it's not uncommon for it to migrate to surgical locations. 2011 After changing pain medications (going from a very high dose of methadone to a more reasonable dose of percocet) she suddenly had back pain. An MRI showed a blown disk at L5-S1 and a spinal fusion was recommended. Jan 2012 Because she couldn't be sure if the pain in her back was the disk or just a part of the RSD that was in her legs, she elected to have the fusion in the hopes that it would alleviate at least some of her pain. The fusion was successful in the sense that it repaired the disk problem, but it didn't alleviate (or increase) the pain in her back (which she knew was probable from the beginning, she wasn't expecting some miracle). Fall 2012 Pain management doctor wants to try a spinal cord stimulator trial to manage the RSD pain. The trial would require placing an electronic lead against the spine (through a needle) with the leads exiting the body to connect to the control box. The trial was great, although the device didn't eliminate 100% of the pain, it significantly improved her quality of life to a level she hadn't enjoyed since 2007 so understandably she wanted to do the implant. The hardware from her spinal fusion was "in the way" and blocked the route of the leads for the implanted stimulator so in order to receive the implant, the hardware would have to be removed. 2nd week of Dec 2012 Ungergoes a hysterectomy (fibroids) that she has been putting off "waiting for a better time" that was never going to come. Jan 3 2013 Surgery to remove the hardware for the spinal fusion. Jan 2014 Surgery to implant the stimulator. March 2014 Surgery to remove the stimulator. The implant site for the battery got a staph infection so it had to be removed a week after it had been turned on for the first time and due to the infection it's benefits couldn't be assessed. Feb 5 2015 9:00am -Surgery to implant the stimulator again with a different surgeon. She woke up from that surgery numb from the waist down in both legs. She wasn't paralyzed, she just couldn't feel anything...anything. 1:00pm -She was discharged and sent home 4:00pm -Calls surgeon after several falls and more than one instance of incontinence (couldn't feel it at all). Surgeon tells her to head back to the hospital *right now*. 6:00pm -Undergoes surgery for a suspected hematoma but there wasn't anything there. Removed more bone and scar tissue (original implant surgeon left the leads on the spine when he removed everything else...nobody but me knew/believed me that he did that until she was opened up for the implant surgery) to make a bigger channel for the leads to sit in and closed. Saturday Feb 7 9:00am After regaining sensation down to her knee in her left leg underwent surgery again to locate the problem, during the surgery it was decided to take the leads off the spine and coil them at the battery site to preserve them in the hopes that once the swelling of all the surgeries went down (and sensation came back) they could be put back into place. Her left leg improved a little more to where she could feel everything down to her ankle but her ankle and foot were numb and her right leg was still numb from hip to toe. She was kept overnight and discharged the following day with a follow up 9 days out. She spent the following 10 days at home using a walker to basically hold herself up with her arms as she drug her feet under her. At some point during this time at home she was made to go to the ER because she basically hadn't had a meaningful bowel movement since the 4th and it was around the 15th. Feb 18 Had the follow up with the surgeon who recommended surgery the following day Feb 19 Surgery again where it was ultimately decided during the procedure to remove the implant and battery, which on a positive note would facilitate an MRI. Surgeon told her that the MRI just showed a lot of bruising but didn't show any reason for the numbness (actual MRI findings showed signs consistent with milomalasia^^sp?). She was kept for a couple of days and then transferred to an acute inpatient rehab hospital (read: nursing home) for 14 days (the max Medicare will cover before requiring justification for a longer stay). Feb 22-Mar 6 During the stay she improved more than I actually thought possible. She never regained any more feeling (left foot and entire right leg completely numb), but she was able to ultimately transition from a wheelchair to a four wheeled walker safely and pretty actively. There was nothing that they could offer her that she couldn't receive from in home or even out patient PT so she (very happily!!!!) went home. Today (My wife now 37, 5'0, 178 lbs) The numbness in her left leg is starting to creep back up her leg and she can no longer feel from lower thigh down anymore and she's starting to have accidents again and nobody seems to know what to do. I don't know how she holds herself together because I can't imagine how I would react in her situation but she is undoubtably the strongest human being I've ever known and I just wanted her story to be told...so if you made it this far I thank you. TL;DR - That **WAS** the TL;DR</TEXT>

    <TITLE>CMV: A Federally mandated minimum wage will never be successful in all locations.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2015-03-28 18:12:49</DATE>
    <TEXT>I believe a dollar amount set by the federal government will never be able to work for all people without damaging or destroying some small businesses. The Federal Government should only mandate that a minimum wage must be established. The State government should be responsible for ensuring that the mandate is applied and provide oversight to the Local government who would assess what the minimum wage should be in order to provide the lowest standard of living (ie shelter, utilities, clothing, healthy food, quality health insurance, vehicle operation, and some form of entertainment for psychological health) and then the Local government sets the minimum wage for that municipality. To change my view you will have to either show me how the Fed can set a $$$ that every small business in every city in the country can pay while also providing the minimum standard of living in every city, or show me why my way won't work better than the current set up.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>CMV: Debt collectors should not be able to offset or intercept tax returns</TITLE>
    <DATE>2015-03-30 20:11:14</DATE>
    <TEXT>I will say upfront that I do believe that the government should have this ability. If you owe the government money they should be able to intercept payments from the government in order to repay that debt. My view is on debt collectors who have bought debt from the government. I am a married father of 4 (6 person household) and I "supported" my family last year on a household income of a little over $14,000 (gross income from tax return). I say supported in quotes because I'm sure many of you can imagine what kind of support 14k is capable of providing 6 people. Due solely based on the EITC I was due a tax refund of $821. Now as I understand it, the EITC exists in an effort to provide people at, near, or below the poverty level a much needed financial boost. I found out a few days ago that my tax return had been intercepted and I got the letter today saying why. A debt collection agency intercepted my tax return to apply it to student loan debt they bought from the government. I'll admit that the debt is valid, but look at my finances, it's not like I have the ability to pay them and I'm just choosing not to... Now if you owe me money and then we get into a situation where I'm giving you money for something else, I am certainly going to hold back the amount you owe me when I make that payment, I get that. That's not what happened though. A third party bought that debt from the government (as I understand it) so the government's interest in that debt has been removed. A debt collector should have to get a court order to intercept that money regardless of the origin of that debt. Am I wrong?</TEXT>

I've held off getting the last couple of things I need because having all of the parts to build it without having the ability to assemble it would kill me. I'm basically looking for someone that would be willing to let me use their welder and knowledge (to make sure the design in my head is the best way to go with what I have) to build my forge (at your place or mine) and maybe offer some guidance on making my 1st set of tongs if you're so inclined. I can't really offer anything in return except gratitude and an empty bowl you can fill with knowledge. I've been lurking, reading, and watching instructional videos for over a year and the itch to swing a hammer is killing me. Is there anyone out there willing to help out a beginner?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>ELI5: How do banks create money and how does that provide a stable economy?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2015-04-02 06:30:53</DATE>
    <TEXT>In a discussion on another sub someone gave the following explanation for how banks make money  gt;The bank creates money in this way. Person A deposits $100 into the bank. The bank keeps $10 as reserve and lends out $90 to person B. Now person A technically has $100 in their bank account, and person B technically has $90 in their bank account. The $90 did not exist before the bank loan. This is the way that most money is created in our economy. Question #1: To what extent is this true and if it is true, how much of our economy is based off of these kinds of transactions? I responded to that example with this:  gt;No, the bank creates the illusion of making money in this way. Person A deposits $100 into the bank. The bank keeps $10 in reserve and loans $90 to Person B. Now the bank has given Person A the illusion that they have $100 when in reality they only have $10.  gt;In your scenario $90 has been created by the bank, and by doing this is benefitting our society and growing our economy. That is great when everything is perfect, but the world is not perfect. Let's continue on in our imperfect world.  gt;While driving home from work Person A gets into an accident and Person B is killed. Person A needs a lawyer and they charge $100 so they go to their bank and request their $100. The bank tells them "sorry but we only have $10, the guy who owes us the other $90 was killed in an accident".  gt;In your mind the bank and person b profits and that's all good and what we need to do to grow the economy, but you never recognize that all of that relies on gambling with Person A's money without their consent Question #2: Why am I wrong? What important part of the equation am I missing? Their response was this:  gt;I'm sorry, you just don't understand how money and banking works, and you're putting words in my mouth and misinterpreting what I'm saying. here http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/quarterlybulletin/2014/qb14q1prereleasemoneycreation.pdf[1] Question #3: Please explain the information contained in this PDF because I couldn't get through 2 pages before I was completely lost.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>ELI5: How or why are stocks an asset and not a liability?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2015-04-02 06:45:01</DATE>
    <TEXT>If I have $1,000 cash I have a net worth of $1,000. As I understand our economy, if I then buy 100 shares of stock at $10/share I still have a net worth of $1,000 and I don't understand how. It was explained to me that the stocks are an asset because they hold a value of $1,000, but that is only true if someone is willing to give me $1,000 for them. It's a gamble not an asset. In my mind stocks are not an asset they are a liability (probably the wrong word) because they have absolutely zero value until the exact instant that cash is exchanged for that stock when I sell it. As I understand it, that is what tanked the economy in 2008. Everyone was leveraging stocks as if they were assets with real value (instead of the risky liability they actually are) and when the stocks tanked everyone lost because money can't materialize from thin air to cover everything. Please ELI5 how our economy can be stable using tactics like this?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So I'm looking around locally trying to find coal and so far I've only found one place that sells it. A small blacksmith/welding shop sells it for $35 for a 50 lb bag, which was about double what I was expecting (for some reason I was thinking ~$10/25 lb bag). Is this a fair price? Also, roughly estimating, how much coal will a brake drum (9 inches across, 2.5 inches deep, w/ 50 CFM blower) burn through per hour of steady work? I assume 50# of coal will keep a hobby blacksmith occupied for quite awhile, but if you're actually working it full time (even as a hobby), what the best guess approximation for how long 50# will go?</TEXT>

    <DATE>2015-04-27 18:11:19</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm in the process of building an anvil stand like [this one]( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/a7/ec/3d/a7ec3d8834aeabae22469e727b8f61ef.jpg) except mine is made with 2x4s instead of 4x4s. I am chiseling out a 1.5-2" recess in the top that is the shape of my anvil base. I'm about .5" deep already and it is both just as difficult as I thought it would be and completely doable at the same time. I only stopped because I ran out of gas and it'll be next weekend til I can pick it up again but I had a couple of questions. I started watching Paul Sellers' series on making a work bench and during the video he uses a chisel quote extensively. I picked up a lot of tips on what I was doing wrong (or ways to do it better) and I want to know if the technique carries over to end grain. My questions are: Can I use his technique of "walking" the bevel edge in the direction I want to go (he used this technique when he was making the mortise/tenons for the leg cross brace) on end grain? Will the "poor man's router" he uses (chisel through a 2x4) work on end grain to get a flat floor? Is it better to work from the middle of my recess out to the walls, or from the walls to the middle? For what it's worth, my 2x4s or laminated mechanically (lag bolts), not glued.</TEXT>

They claim to be perfect for the grill, but I imagine using bbq sauce on these things would be sacrilegious. How do I prepare and cook these without ruining them?

    <TEXT>I'm not even sure if this is really an issue, but it's something I've been pondering. If a mechanical hammer of some kind is used during the creation of something, can that thing still be described as hand forged? Is there a line where an object would lose that "hand forged" moniker or is it valid as long as a hand swung a hammer at some point during the process? What are your personal thoughts?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>CMV: Minimum wage jobs should not be viewed as strictly jobs for teenagers or unskilled workers and instead should be viewed as legitimate careers</TITLE>
    <DATE>2015-08-10 22:44:08</DATE>
    <TEXT>Edit: I feel it's necessary to define a few terms in the context that I'm using them for clarity. * job - Any position where both employer and employee know, or should know, that the position is long-term temporary at best and that at some point the employee will move on. * career - your chosen life's work. If you work fast food your whole life, that is your career * minimum wage job - Any job, usually in the service industry, that generally requires little to no formal education, and generally pays between the federal minimum wage up to and including $15.00/hr. _______________________________________________________________________________________ Minimum wage is a hot topic of debate these days, and I'm sure a lot of visitors to this sub are tired of talking about raising, lowering, or eliminating the minimum wage but that isn't what this is about. I did a search and couldn't find anything else that was similar to my stance so I'm hoping it will foster some new discussions. During every debate concerning minimum wage someone will always say something to the effect that "minimum wage jobs aren't meant to support a family/are meant for teenagers and unskilled workers" and I think that this line of thinking is just outright wrong. Throughout the past 50 years, people took minimum wage service industry jobs when they were young/inexperienced in order to gain the experience that was required in order to land a production career. That was the viewpoint, you got a minimum wage "job" in order to get the experience to start a "career" in the production world (whether directly producing something, or supporting those who do ie office staff, vendors, logistics, etc.). Also over that time, the economy in the US has gone from production based to service based. This has caused a severe drop in production "careers" leaving nothing but the service industry left. The service industry is now the career simply due to lack of other options. I joined the military when I was 20 years old because after working in the service industry at minimum wage for 5 years I finally landed a production job on an assembly line (this was in 1998). The money was better than anything I'd made previously, but not good enough to get ahead. I ended up getting my girlfriend at the time pregnant and I saw the future that my current position offered and I wanted more so I enlisted. I spent 10 years working as an Aviation Electronics Technician before getting out to accept a position as a Federal Law Enforcement Officer with the US Forest Service. I worked at that position for 5 years before losing my job through no fault of my own. So there I was, a very highly skilled electronics tech, with 5 years of law enforcement experience, living in an area where 80% of the available jobs are minimum wage service industry and I needed a job. I applied everywhere....I mean everywhere. I filled out applications for Taco Bell, McDonald's, Walmart, etc. I got exactly 4 callbacks and 2 interviews during my job search where I was filling out 5-10 job applications per week...for 3 years before giving up. I couldn't get hired...why? Because for 15 years I made between $28-75k/year and every employer knows that there is no way I can support my family on minimum wage...and why would they pay me more when they can just pay someone else the minimum. I have been effectively unemployable in my current location since 2011 due in large part to the fact that everyone (including employers) knows minimum wage doesn't pay enough to support a single person, much less a family of six. I think the mentality that "minimum wage jobs aren't careers and shouldn't pay enough to support a family" is more destructive than it is beneficial. TL;DR: Minimum wage jobs are no longer the sole realm of teenagers and the unskilled because the US doesn't produce anything anymore so those are the only careers available to most people. _____  gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

    <TITLE>What has been your experience acclimating your barky dog/s to chickens?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2015-08-14 07:55:06</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've been thinking about it for awhile, and after talking to my wife and kids everyone is on board so we're in the planning phase of getting chickens. One of my biggest worries is [Spryte](http://i.imgur.com/0qlvoJw.jpg), our 9 year old [Jack Russell mix](http://i.imgur.com/DyoIXbK.jpg). I rescued [Spryte](http://i.imgur.com/MtA3C2G.jpg) from a local shelter when she was ~5 and gave her to my wife for our anniversary. One of the things that I loved about the dog right away was she was quite literally the only dog at the shelter that didn't bark at me during the 3-4 laps I made looking at all the dogs. She would jump up the fence high enough to almost look me in the eye (I'm 6'2) but she never made a sound...just tongue hanging out smiling and happy. That was the dog that we had for all of 3 days after bringing her home...then she found her bark...and she hasn't lost it since. We live on 2.5 acres out in the country and she barks at everything...the cars as they drive past, the horses across the street, the goats and dogs on one side of the horses, the sheep on the other, the birds in the yard, the squirrels....my god the squirrels, oh and don't even get me started on cats good lord does she hate cats!!! Well that's not accurate...she hates pretty much everything. She believes that she should be the only 4 legged creature allowed to roam the earth...and she will let everyone know it. Now, all kidding aside, we have had friends and family visit with their dogs...and after an initial, sometimes rather emotional, meet and greet she has always been able to coexist with animals that share the home...at least temporarily. I'm fairly confident that if we were to get chicks, and get Spryte used to them when they were young, that she would accept them as they grew up and was hoping to get other people's experiences. Our property, while big, isn't fenced very well, but there is a 6' chainlink fence around our house with enough room for 6-10 chickens to run around in, so I'd love to be able to build a coop/tractor inside the fence because if it's outside it either limits their grazing, or dramatically increases my costs and I'm doing this on a shoestring budget as it is. So tell me your stories</TEXT>

    <TITLE>CMV: Using suicide prevention as an excuse to legislate anything is overstepping the boundaries of government</TITLE>
    <DATE>2015-10-07 07:54:20</DATE>
    <TEXT>I see a lot of this is discussions about gun control recently, but I want to be clear up front that I don't want to limit the discussion to just gun control. I believe that suicide is the ultimate act of freedom and nobody has the right to limit someone's ability to commit suicide **against their will** (I want to be clear on that point, if someone wants or asks for help they absolutely deserve that help). A lot of people advocating for gun control say things like "if we limit the availability of guns, fewer people will commit suicide" and I believe that is morally wrong in a free society. They justify their stance by claiming that a lot of people who attempt suicide, and live, make the claim that at the last moment before going through with their attempt that they regretted their decision. My response to that, although callous, is "So what? It was their choice to make and they made it". What gives anyone, much less the government, the right to restrict someone else from taking their own life? On top of that, I believe that anyone who is actively trying to restrict access to ~~guns~~ anything in order to "prevent suicide", while doing absolutely nothing to increase the availability of affordable, worthwhile, and effective mental healthcare really has no intention of preventing suicide.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2015-10-08 01:55:55</DATE>
    <TEXT>Over the past 20 years it has become increasingly more popular for employers to employ 20 part time employees where traditionally they would have employed 10 full time employees. The single largest reason for this is because in a lot of places they are not required to provide employee benefits for part time employees. Part time employment should exist for the people who choose, for whatever reason, to work part time, but employers should not be allowed to game the system by shorting their employee's benefits/pay by hiring only part time people.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My daughter's 94 eagle vision broke down awhile back, just wouldn't start. After changing out the fuel pump I narrowed it down to the ignition switch. Changing the ignition switch fixed the problem but created a new one. When I installed the switch everything had guides or keyways so I'm fairly certain everything was installed correctly but now the starter won't disengage. When you turn the key the starter engages immediately after the first click. When idling in Park or neutral the starter engages intermittently and the only way to get it to stop is putting it in gear. I'm assuming that somehow I put something together wrong, but everything was keyed in a specific way so I don't know how that was possible.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2015-11-29 20:43:09</DATE>
    <TEXT>My daughter's 94 eagle vision TSI has a pretty violent shake in it that worries me but I don't know how to locate it. It happens mostly between 40-55 mph and again between 70-80 mph (I haven't driven it faster than that) and is coming from the engine area. The shake stops as soon as you let off of the accelerator, or if you give it a little extra gas, but only happens at those speeds. The steering wheel is rock steady during the shake to the point where if I was free floating in the car touching nothing but the steering wheel, you wouldn't know anything was shaking. The gas pedal doesn't shake much and I don't know about the brake cause it stops as soon as I take my foot off the gas, it's almost like you feel it throughout the frame or body. The fact that the steering wheel doesn't shake leads me to believe that it isn't a suspension problem which leads me more to thinking it may be a loose or broken motor mount. Am I right? What are my trouble shooting steps here?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[Sci-fi/Adventure] The Revolution - 745 words</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-01-20 10:16:29</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've been wrestling with the urge to write something for the past few years but I've never been able to come up with the story that I wanted to tell until a few nights ago. I started making notes and a small outline of where I want the story to go and then wrote the following to build my world and give a little bit of the backstory. I've never really written anything before, not even a creative writing class in high school, and would like to get some feedback. So here it is... Partway through the 21st Century, bowing to pressure from The United States and desperate to curb international terrorism, the most powerful Nation States formed The New World Order. Together they wrote a new Constitution and created The Supreme Court of The NWO that would become the Supreme Law of the World making it easier to try and convict those responsible for international terrorism. One of the Amendments in this new Constitution legalized all drugs for recreational use. The US Government, seeing a way to profit from this, enacted a law that drugs could only be purchased at government run and supplied dispensaries. Overnight the US Government became the single largest purchaser of illicit drugs in the world. Due to the quantity being purchased, the once great risk virtually eliminated, and by providing all transportation, the Government was able to push the wholesale price for drugs down to almost nothing. These savings were not passed on to the American consumer however, in fact after several hefty taxes, surcharges, and fees were added, the drugs in the dispensaries averaged double the previous street prices. The middle class and the poor became loyal customers regardless of the price and the government made billions while funneling those profits to their most loyal backers. These increased profits were of course shared with the politicians during their next campaign cycle, and over time the wealthy class used this newfound wealth to successfully lobby to eliminate worker protections in exchange for a Minimum Income System [that would cover minimum living requirements]. Cash was eliminated and replaced with Digital Crypto Currency Credits (or Dicccs) that are accessible only through your ID Card. Minimum wage was abolished, as were holidays, paid vacations, and overtime pay requirements. The middle class was destroyed as wages plummeted creating two classes; The Elite Class and The Dependent Class. The Elite Class began buying up real estate and demolishing entire neighborhoods to create Government funded Projects to meet the new demand for the cheap affordable housing created by the MIS. Although the country is still a democracy, every candidate for public office is a member of The Elite and thus only concerned with keeping and gaining power and wealth. Voting is done through fingerprint and DNA sample to prevent fraud and [secretly] as a means to control dissidents. As poverty rose so did violent crime and in response to crime and with the full cooperation of the citizenry the US repealed the 2nd Amendment and instituted a gun buyback program that paid double the weapon's worth to turn it in. All but a portion of The Elite and those on the black market were all too happy to give up their guns without a struggle. Within a few years The Dependent Class had been reduced to slaves for The Elite and a Resistance Movement began to form. During this time the NWO had become increasingly more outraged at the direction the US Government was heading resulting in an ultimatum to remove the obvious corruption from the government or suffer the consequences. On July 4, 2076 The Supreme Court of The New World Order convicted the US Government of crimes against humanity and ordered it abolished and replaced...by force if necessary. The US responded threatening nuclear action against any country who took up arms against them. The NWO, wanting a peaceful solution, voted to expel the United States from the NWO and exile them within their own boarders cut off from the rest of the world. Walls were constructed spanning the boarders of both Canada and Mexico and a blockade was set along all shorelines. All air travel into, out of or within the continental United States was prohibited, as was all sea travel. Any aircraft in the air would be shot down without warning or contact, any ship crossing the blockade would be sunk, and any person attempting to leave would be shot. Alaska and Hawaii immediately succeeded from the Union with Alaska being absorbed by Canada and Hawaii becoming it's own Nation State. A giant railway system was built to accommodate the travel requirements needed to replace air travel, and the sudden need to replace fossil fuels, now a finite product, spurned advancements in solar and battery technology that eliminated the need for them as a source of power completely. A battery half the size and weight of a car battery coupled with a 3'x3' solar panel could power the average home for 3 days on a single day's charge and all methods of travel were now electric and clean.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>What happened to my light bulb?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-01-22 02:05:44</DATE>
    <TEXT>Late last night I started to smell something that smelled like burnt electrical components. If you've worked on electronics or ever had something burn up you should recognize the smell, it's pretty specific. I couldn't locate the source and eventually it went away before going to bed. Today I turned the lamp on my nightstand on and within a few minutes the smell returned so I turned it off and examined the lamp, the cord, the surge protector it was plugged into, and the wall outlet and found nothing out of the ordinary, nothing hot or even warm, and couldn't source the smell. Turned the lamp back on, smell came back, and as I was reaching to turn it off it turned off on its own, flipped the switch a few times and nothing. After doing another examination, I checked the bulb and [found this](http://i.imgur.com/63BFlyn.jpg). I replaced it with a new bulb and it works now with no smell. So what happened? Is this how these bulbs usually fail? Is my lamp ok to continue to use? Did I almost die in a fire (a common insult in my household)?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>An open letter to David Green, CEO and Founder of Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-08-24 05:27:36</DATE>
    <TEXT>Dear Mr Green, In an open letter from you dated Aug 22, 2016 [found here](http://conservativebrief.com/breaking-hobby-lobby-to-close-all-stores-the-reason-why-is-heartbreaking/?utm_source=AmericanColumn amp;utm_medium=AmericanColumn amp;utm_campaign=AmericanColumn) you explain that you may be required to close the doors to all of the businesses that you've dedicated the last 40 years of your life to building due to a mandate by the government that you provide coverage for drugs and medical procedures that go against your personal religious beliefs. I find it strange that during the 40 years you've been building your company from a small garage business with a retail shop the size of most people's living rooms to the expansive corporation that now spans 41 states, employs over 13,000 people, and enjoys sales in excess of $3 billion annually you have had no qualms paying the governmentally mandated Local, State, and Federal Income, Sales, and other various Taxes. You had to have known that a portion of the money that you were paying in both corporate and personal income taxes were being used in ways that violated the word of God. Where was the outcry then? Where has the accusations of religious persecution been prior to now? I never heard a word from you personally, or from Hobby Lobby as a corporation, any of the times when our government used your tax dollars to exact revenge for a wrong done to the United States instead of turning the other cheek as the Bible commands. You were silent when the US Government took the official stance of "Shock  amp; Awe" after 9/11 as a means of avenging our dead citizens instead of a more Christian position of nonresistance. I've never heard you speak out against, nor threaten to close your stores because a portion of your tax dollars were used to execute prisoners convicted of a capital crime when the Bible commands that Thou Shall Not Kill. You've never claimed that your religious beliefs were under attack when the government used portions of your tax dollars to aid people and countries of different faiths when the Bible commands that "you shall have no God's before me". There have never been any complaints from you or your corporation when portions of your tax dollars were used to pay government employees who worked on the Sabbath or religious holidays. I feel that it is safe to assume that a person knowledgeable enough to build such a successful business from scratch knows that tax payers don't get to dictate how their tax dollars are spent beyond casting their vote for the person who most aligns with their personal beliefs. Why is it then that you feel you should get to dictate how any portion of money you pay to ensure the good health of your workforce is spent? Your personal position and beliefs on the subjects of abortion and/or contraception has less than zero bearing as it relates to the decisions made between your employees and their doctors. You are not upset because your religious beliefs are under attack, because they aren't, you are upset because you are losing grip on a tool that has previously allowed you to exercise control over the people you employ by forcing them to bend to the will of your personal religious dogma. You are not being made to choose between your religious beliefs and following the law as you claim in your letter; you are being forced to show the same respect toward other beliefs that you yourself enjoy by allowing your employees the freedom of following the religion of their own choosing, or none at all, instead of being required to follow and respect the rules of the religious preferences of their employer regardless of their own personal belief system. You have enjoyed being successful over the last 40 years due in large part to the fact that the country you call home was founded on the principle of freedom, all the while acting like a religious dictator to those you employ in what is one of the most arrogant and disgusting displays of hypocrisy and theocracy I've ever witnessed in this country. Sincerely, /u/subject807</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Looking for anyone who has a dual diagnosis of RSD/CRPS plus MS</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-10-13 08:58:43</DATE>
    <TEXT>My wife was diagnosed with Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy (RSD) now called Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) in 2008 and we have been battling this disease through 15 surgeries over the past 8 years. Her most recent surgery was in March when she had a spinal cord stimulator installed (3rd attempt) and we believe that the surgeon either caused spinal cord damage, or aggravated or made worse damage that was done during the prior attempt at installation (she woke up from that surgery numb from the waist down but ultimately regained sensation on the left side only...MRI showed Myelomalacia in the effected area of the spinal cord). She has been spiraling down the last 6-8 weeks with muscle pain and atrophy, deep bone pain, loss of function in her right leg, loss of peripheral vision in her right eye (if dead ahead is noon she loses sight at around 1:30-2:00), and her blood pressure is through the roof (highest has been 186/135 and her norm is 118/70ish) and nobody seems to know why. She is scheduled for a brain MRI on the 18th to begin the tests for MS and we were hoping to connect with someone who has both. We understand that the MRI is looking for lesions indicative of MS and if they're found a spinal tap will be ordered to look for increased proteins in the spinal fluid that show that the immune system is battling itself. Our concerns are that she has been on either percocet, fentanyl patches, or methadone for 8 years and has been on quite a few different anti-depressants and anti-psychotics during that time as well which can cause things that will show up in a brain MRI that may or may not look like lesions. We're also wondering if CRPS causes the same kind of immune response as MS and will show up in the spinal tap since it is an auto-immune disease as well. Her GP put her on blood pressure meds, then ordered a CT of her spine when they didn't lower her BP, and then ordered the brain MRI when the CT didn't show anything acute. Currently her GP and her Therapist are freaking out (They're afraid her BP might cause a stroke), which in turn is freaking her out, the surgeon that did the implant is 3+ hours away and really has no desire to see her (not that we could afford to make the trip if he did), and her pain management specialist is out of the country until November and has no clue what is going on. There is a lot more to her story and I'll provide details to anyone interested, but we're just looking for someone...anyone...who can help us calm down. She has no history of MS on her Father's side of the family but her Mother was adopted so her medical history begins and ends with her. Her symptoms all point to MS, but they also point to spinal cord damage, and a few other things as well. It is such bullshit that healthcare in this country is so fucked that it takes 6-8 weeks to see a doctor when conditions like my wife's can become permanent if they aren't treated promptly. Nobody seems to have any sense of urgency, meanwhile we're here freaking out because she can barely walk anymore. UGH!!!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My wife has had CRPS since 2008 and I have had no other option but being the rock for her to lean on. I have filled that role willingly and with pleasure, but to say that I haven't paid a price for it would be a lie. Over the past 6 months her condition has deteriorated in a way that mimics very aggressive MS but due to an implant she has she has been unable to get an MRI to confirm the diagnosis and begin treatment or continue looking for a cause. We finally found a surgeon today who is willing to assume the liability of removing it and scheduled the surgery for next Friday. I literally just had to excuse myself to the bathroom because I started crying as I was typing this...and I cannot let her see that right now. This will be my wife's 15th surgery since 2008 and the surgeon gave her an 80% chance of coming out of it paralyzed from the waist down. I don't know how to deal with this......... I'm a few months shy of 40 and I have to look forward to a lifetime of being my wife's caretaker as I watch the woman I love wither and die. How the fuck am I supposed to deal with that???</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I wish more people understood that Term Limits are the wrong answer</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-01-04 22:10:43</DATE>
    <TEXT>I understand the desire for term limits, and I've championed them myself on many an occasion, but I've never really liked them as a solution to the problems they're "solving" because they're lazy. Term limits weren't included in the original Constitution because voters are supposed to impose them at the ballot box. Preventing The People from keeping a respected and effective person in office due to term limits is not beneficial to The People. The drawback to term limits is that it removes power from The People and I resist on moral grounds anything that does that. I believe that the term limits imposed upon the Presidency by Congress usurped power from the people and transferred it to political parties in an unconstitutional power grab and we should be repealing it, not adding to it. Imagine if Trump is as successful as he claims he can be. He is able to do everything he wants and everything he claims will happen as a result of it happens. If He was the most successful President in history why would we want to limit him to 2 terms? Imagine if Obama had been able to run for a 3rd term. There were a lot of people who "held their nose" and voted for Trump because Clinton was such a bad candidate in their eyes. Had the election been Obama v Trump I believe Obama would have won easily because sometimes it's better to go with the Devil you know. I've seen my conservative friends and family spend most of the last couple of years claiming they want term limits for Congress, but in the 2016 election nearly every Republican up for re-election won, even the ones that had been there 20+ years. People say they don't want career politicians but keep voting them into office because voting for the other party is not something the average American can bring themselves to do under normal circumstances. We can: * Eliminate Career Politicians * Promote New Ideas and * Fight Corruption Which are the 3 things term limits are supposed to "solve" by simply requiring incumbents to have a challenger from their own party in every election, and it wouldn't require a Constitutional Amendment, which in this political climate has a less than zero chance of being passed.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Are there any medications that would mimic some of the properties of Crystal Meth as it relates to pain relief? I know, I know, but please read.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-02-22 05:03:00</DATE>
    <TEXT>My wife (39 Caucasian 5'1 144lbs) was diagnosed with CRPS 9 years ago (currently effecting both legs, lumbar and thoracic spine, hips, and both hands) and has gone through all of the standard treatments up to and including a spinal cord stimulator with little to no relief from any of them. She has undergone 16 surgeries since 2008 (not all related to CRPS) and has been designated as treatment resistant. Due to a 'perfect storm' of unfortunate events she ended up with spinal cord damage (myelomalacia approx 2.3mm) at T9-T10 and the stimulator has been removed as a result and has been advised to never have another surgery at that location unless it is a life or death situation. She was taken off of opioid pain killers over a year ago due to a conflict over legal medical marijuana use (which had been condoned for the previous 6 years by the same doctor) and is currently only being treated with Gabapentin at the maximum daily dose, antidepressants, and marijuana for sleep. Her pain management specialist recently admitted that he has reached the limit of his knowledge on how to treat her condition and passed her off to the pain clinic at Stanford in the hopes they'll be able to help. She has her initial appointment in a few weeks but we have little to no hope of them being able to do anything because she is not a candidate for every treatment that we can find that she hasn't already tried due to one reason or another, and some of the problems associated with the cord damage eliminate her from participating in most clinical studies as well. Last summer she had the opportunity to try meth recreationally and she discovered through that opportunity that it provided more pain relief than any medication or procedure that she has tried so far. I don't think I have to list all of the reasons why self medicating with meth is an incredibly dangerous proposition, but it is agonizing having to stand in the way of the woman you love trying to get relief from pain that is constant and debilitating. On a normal day she is in a wheelchair when we leave the house because it's too physically draining and painful to walk, but on meth she's able to at least walk around the grocery store for a short time. My questions are: What are the chemical properties of meth that are providing this relief? Are there any prescription medications that can provide the same thing without the glaringly obvious dangers of using an illegal and 'dirty' street drug? Should she be honest with the new doctor at Stanford about her history of use and the benefits it has provided?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Someone asked me these questions a couple of days during a [discussion on the feasibility of unemployed and poor people moving to another location](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/61nd1j/what_is_the_best_example_of_an_out_of_touch_with/dffzcrn/?st=j0u9ud34 amp;sh=df051387) for better job prospects, and after composing my response I decided to post it here instead and provide the asker with a link. Be prepared for a wall of text and to save you the trouble of looking I'll say in advance that there is no TL;DR at the bottom. My wife's family lives in the toxic town that we just left (well 10 years ago lol) because there's nothing there that provides anyone a meaningful future. My MIL is a wonderful woman who embraced me as a member of her family immediately and without her help for a few years we would not have survived. She has been more of a Mother to me over the last 10 years than my own Mother was for the previous 30 and there's nothing I could ever do to accurately express the amount of gratitude I have for her. Unfortunately her marriage has been filled with verbal, emotional, and I suspect physical abuse and she is miserable but won't leave. She deals with her misery by meddling in the lives of her children to the extent they will allow, and my wife is her favorite target because she won't stand up for herself and her other two sisters will. She's been working as a CNA in a hospital for over 30 and as a result both knows a lot and doesn't know enough at the same time. She is constantly second guessing both my wife and her doctors, she expects the worst case scenario for every situation and makes sure to go into detail on what the worst is. If we lived in the same town her Mother would smother her and the fits of frustration and anxiety she experiences after their almost daily phone calls would happen multiple times a day. There is nothing that town offers that would be an improvement to my current situation lol. My younger brother just spent his savings to move my Dad from here to where he lives last summer. We were talking somewhat regularly for the last couple of years but I haven't heard from him since then. I heard through the grapevine that they're getting married this summer which is great because from what I could observe during the week they were here she's really good for him and he loves the hell out of her. He's marrying into 4 kids under 11 and I have been in that exact position before so I know he's got his hands full and I hope he knows what he's getting himself in to because that can be a rough road. I've probably seen or talked to my older brother half a dozen times over the last 20 years. I have no explanation for the lack of contact other than life gets in the way. We both went in different directions when I was 17 and our paths just never really crossed again and every time we talk on the phone it feels uncomfortable and forced because we really don't know much about each other after the age of 18 and we're usually only talking because it's a holiday or something. He's never been married but he's been living with his girlfriend and her 3 kids for I don't even know how many years. At present none of us has fathered a male child so unless that changes in the future our family name dies with us. That's something I think about every once in awhile because it's both kind of a big thing and essentially meaningless at the same time. My Dad is on a fixed income and when I moved him from a town where he knew no one to a town 10 minutes from me where he also knew no one [but me] he was emotionally devastated from one of the most cruel things I've ever seen a person do to their spouse and a few years later was essentially crippled with depression and sitting in his apartment just paying bills and waiting to die. I tried to be there for him as best I could but our relationship had suffered the same fate as my older brothers and we just never talked much after I left at 17 and this was the first time we had spent any significant time together in more than 15 years and we quickly discovered that we didn't have a whole lot in common, we didn't have a whole lot to talk about, our politics couldn't be more different and he entered the picture too late for my emotionally awkward kids to form any sort of meaningful attachment with him even though I'll give him credit for putting in the effort because he tried harder to bond with them than he did with me when I was their age and although he never even hinted at it, I know the rejection poured alcohol on his existing emotional wounds. With very few misses he came to our house for dinner every Sunday and we'd watch football or a movie during the off season. We encouraged him to come more but he said he'd feel like he was intruding or keeping us from doing other things just to entertain him. After my wife's injury he started to feel like a burden to my already heavy load and negotiated the move with my brother and told me after the plans were finalized. He is doing much better since the move, he's getting out of his apartment and he's spending a lot of time with the grand kids. I don't think he'll ever fully recover from what his wife did to him and I know without a doubt that he'll never date again but I'm glad to see he's able to enjoy himself again. In all likelihood, short of a financial windfall, he will probably pass away before I see him again. My mother's husband died last fall just shy of their 20th anniversary which forced her back into the workforce for the first time in 30 years because she has MS and Addison's disease, so the woman who was an RN in a previous life now makes minimum wage in a shoe store, but she can't work too much or she'll lose her disability since she's still a few years shy of qualifying for SS, which won't improve her situation or allow her to stop working. Thankfully she's got an amazing emotional support group and she is surrounded by her sisters and Father and friends. I worry about her though because she's not adjusting well to being a widow and she's said a few things that put thoughts in your head, you know? My Mother has been good at a lot of things in her life, but being alone isn't one of them so even if suicide isn't an issue dying of a broken heart or losing the will to live is. In all likelihood, short of a financial windfall, she will probably pass away before I see her again. My wife had a routine knee surgery in 2008 that triggered a cascading series events that ultimately resulted in her having 17 surgeries between then and now and being on disability since 2011 due to Complex Regional Pain Syndrome or CRPS. 2 years ago she had surgery to have a spinal cord simulator implanted and woke up numb from the waist down. She could move her legs and feet (well as much as she could before anyway) and feel her normal pain on the inside of her leg but she had no sensation on the skin at all and she said it felt like her feet weighed 500 pounds each. Over the next few days she had 4 more surgeries trying to find the cause of the numbness and the implant was removed during the last one. She slowly regained sensation in her left leg over the course of a couple of weeks but it never came back in her right. She learned how to walk again in a rehab hospital where she spent 3 weeks and the surgeon spent the next 6 months scheduling a monthly appointment so they could ask if there was any improvement, tell us how sorry they were, and explain again that they don't know what happened and nothing like this has ever happened before, ok come see me next month and remember, keep your hopes up it can take up to 6 months to regain feeling after something like this. At the end of the 6 months the surgeon said there wasn't anything more they could do and discharged her as a patient. We eventually learned that she has spinal cord damage at the location of the surgery that's visible on an MRI. The stimulator was the only treatment option for CRPS available to her that she hadn't already tried and a year after the last surgery she tried it again with another surgeon 5 hours away that specialized in difficult stimulator cases. The surgery was successful in that she did not come out of it worse off than when she went in (this can only be said of about 4 of the 17 surgeries she's undergone) but we found out a couple of weeks later that the stimulator wasn't working properly. She was feeling stimulation in places she wasn't supposed to and not feeling it in the places that she should. An xray was ordered to verify it was positioned correctly during the post-op appointment and we were told that the Rep for the implant company would contact us to schedule an appointment so they could check out the programing. After that they basically stopped answering her calls, never returned messages, and hasn't seen her since and it's not like we can just stop into the office or something. She called the rep all the time but could never leave a message due to a full voicemail and we eventually learned that he no longer worked for the company. A few months later we were at one of our son's football games and she moved her leg to adjust her position and got a pain in her thigh that brought her to tears by the end of the game. Over the next week or two she slowly started losing muscle function in her right leg, she was having hot flashes, her BP went through the roof and she nearly panicked the office when it was 196/132 one day, and she noticed she had lost some peripheral vision. All of these problems coincided with her pain specialist of 6 years admitting that he had reached the limit of his knowledge on how to treat her condition and would be referring her to a larger clinic 60 miles away, and her primary care doctor of 9 years discharging her as a patient due to a billing policy change. She got into one doctor who thought her symptoms indicated a very aggressive form of MS and she needed a brain MRI immediately to confirm. As it turned out the "MRI compatible" implant she had put in was only compatible under certain conditions and there's no imaging place within 200 miles that's either willing or able to meet those conditions. We knew she would need annual or bi-annual MRI's to monitor the spinal injury and had the surgeon been clear about the compatibility issues she wouldn't have done the surgery in the first place. She was able to convince a surgeon we trust to remove the implant but he was very blunt about the risk and said odds are 70% that she would wake up from the surgery a paraplegic but thankfully that didn't happen because he's a fucking rock star. The brain MRI ruled out MS so we were back to square one. The new pain clinic declined to take her case because it was too challenging and after that we had to go find specialists ourselves and then find a doctor willing to write a referral because she won't be established with her new primary doctor until the end of April. We got a referral and drove 4 hours one way (6.5 to get back due to traffic) to get to Stanford Med Center and they suggested that UC Davis might be a better option and thanked us for coming in. We found out later that the doctor never intended to take her case and only saw her as a "courtesy" which makes me question her understand of what it means to be courteous. After playing 'find a referring doctor' again and sending them her records UC Davis also declined to take her case stating they were at capacity and couldn't take on such a challenging case at this time. Last August my wife was in rough shape but she was walking unassisted 90% of the time and used a cane the other 10% on bad days or after over doing it; today she needs a wheelchair to do anything outside the house more involved than walking into a gas station and back. The paralysis has gone untreated this entire time because for individually legitimate reasons she's lost all of her doctors at the same time and now nobody wants to take on the liability associated with taking on a patient with a spinal cord injury and a few days ago her left foot cramped and she said the pain feels just like the pain that started the loss of muscle function. She had her first session with a psychologist today and it went really well which is great because I believe it's something she desperately needs. She told me that the doctor said after 3-4 visits she'd like to begin including me in the sessions as well so I can be a part of her treatment which is probably a good idea because I could probably benefit from it as well. My story? When I was 20 I was working at an assembly plant making too much money to quit but not enough to succeed building about 1200 parts per shift at a bench. 3 of the other 8 benches were occupied by people who had been occupying them for 10-15 years and the woman at the front supervising had been at that position for 19 years^and ^had ^the ^personality ^to ^prove ^it so I joined the Navy because fuck that. Well actually I joined the Navy because my first call was to the Air Force and they disqualified me after I admitted to using LSD in the past. Then I called the Marines because they've got kick ass dress uniforms and they disqualified me because I had a GED instead of a diploma (Holy fuck am I ever so thankful that they did that because I would not have made a very good marine and I would have been miserable). Then I called the Navy (I was not calling the Army even if the Navy said no) and after some playful banter that indicated I should keep my fucking mouth shut about my drug history and the handful of failure to appear warrants for traffic tickets I had at the time and come into the office and see them so I did. I tested, went through a physical, picked a job, and off to boot camp I went. Aside from getting in shape I was actually disappointed in boot camp and at the end thought ***that's it??*** I spent the next 9 years fixing communication, navigation, and electronic warfare equipment on jets which was pretty awesome for a guy who spent his childhood building model airplanes and hanging them from his ceiling in mock dog fights as he dreamed of being a pilot. The Navy changed the rules for retirement near the end of my first enlistment by removing the ability for an E-5 to serve for 20 years and earn a retirement; instead they would be discharging them without benefits at 14 years if they fail to advance to E-6 by then. I was able to time my reenlistment so that my next contract would expire before I crossed 10 years of service because I didn't like the idea of crossing that line without a guaranteed retirement. When the time came to make the decision I was recently married to a woman with 4 young children between 5 and 9 and if I stayed in I would be transferring to sea duty where I would spend the next 4 years bouncing in and out for varying lengths of time including at least 2 and possibly 3 six month deployments and an equal number of 6 week deployments leading up to them. Around year 7 I was caught doing something that is common practice but not discussed because when it's discovered it must be acted on. Because I told the truth when confronted they were forced to act on it and I was made an example of. At my Captain's Mast my CO asked me "why are you here?" after asking a few preliminary questions and being unable to figure out what I had done wrong so I had to explain it to him. Considering the possible consequences I was lucky that the only thing it cost me was the duty station of my dreams that had fallen into my lap when I was up for transfer in a year, what little reputation I had been able to build as a middle-of-the-road sailor on my best day, and two consecutive evaluation scores that would make advancement impossible for several years. I crunched the numbers and found out that even if I scored perfect on the test each time it was mathematically impossible for me to advance to E-6 before 14 years so I started job hunting. I accepted a job as a federal law enforcement officer with the US Forest Service in a city I'd never heard of in the next state over that would give us a 4 hour buffer between my wife and her family and off we went. We had only been there for 3-4 months when I left for the police academy on the other side of the country for 21 weeks. I am not the kind of guy that pops into people's head when they think cop; I would never be confused with an Alpha personality and I am generally annoyed by them, I'm a left leaning liberal, I avoid confrontation whenever possible (but am able to step up when the situation demands it), I hate working out, and I might be the least motivated person I've ever known. I've learned that when I can do nothing I will do nothing so the key to keeping me on track is a tight schedule, because if I have something to do I can't do nothing. For that reason among others I excelled in every area of the police academy except the physical fitness part and I was only *just able* to pass the fitness requirements although I was injured at the time which they acknowledged but it was the last opportunity I had to pass so if I failed I was going home without a job in a city I don't know to a wife and 4 kids depending on me to pay the bills after ripping them away from everything they've ever known a few months after meeting me and then leaving them a few months later. Between those upheavals, future field training, and the long hours on the job I was only ever able to really forge a bond with the oldest and as far as she is concerned I'm her Dad even though she calls me by my first name. Unlike the older two (who share a father that never laid eyes on the younger one), the younger two had their biological father active in their lives so the dynamic between us was different and I've always just kinda been the guy that married their mom. We're family but there's no real affection from them and after years of awkward rejections I stopped trying. As far as I'm concerned they are my kids and I love them as if they were, but to them I'm viewed more as an authority figure than one of their parents. The other one needs someone to hate and she has named me as that designated person and beyond that I'd rather not kick that particular hornet's nest of emotions. After I graduated from the police academy I was required to complete 3 months of field training that could take place anywhere in the country a month at a time before I was clear to go patrol on my own. When I got back home I was assured by my captain that it would take 3-6 months for me to receive my first FTO assignment and I would ride passenger with another officer or do office work until then. When we moved my wife quit her job instead of taking a transfer because she had been putting off knee surgery for years and she wanted to be able to get settled and get that repaired before she went back to work so she scheduled it now that I was back and could take care of the house while she recovered. The day after the surgery my captain called me and told me that assignments had just come in and I was leaving for 2 months two days from now. I had no choice but to leave and she had no choice but to be a single mother of 4 children which doesn't lend itself to recovery very well. All 3 of the FTOs that I trained under were just like me and we all worked very well together. They were laid back and easy going, they were the smiling cop that approached your campsite to chat and see how you're doing, not to look for a reason to write you a ticket. We wrote tickets when the situation dictated and issued warnings when it didn't. It was exactly the kind of atmosphere that I was hoping to find when I chose the forest service over the highway patrol job I was about to be offered a few weeks later and this was shaping up to be the best job I ever had. Once I had completed training my captain gave me priority areas and crimes to concentrate on and the freedom to pretty much set my own schedule. My office was 25 miles away from my direct supervisor and with the exception of assigned days off I was given the freedom to set my own hours and work anywhere within my patrol zone that I wanted. I spent my first year figuring out who I was as a cop and exploring the 2.3 million acres I was responsible for patrolling which includes some of the best scenery in the state. I chose to operate like the friendly forest ranger and I found it more rewarding and beneficial to educate people about not only what the laws were but why they were put in place and why they're important than it was to just write tickets all day. My ticket count may have been low but my real world results were beginning to materialize when Super Cop transferred in to fill a position that had been vacant in my patrol zone for years. SC was the kind of guy that pop's into your head when you think LAPD SWAT and although we didn't butt heads we didn't get along from the start because I thought he was unnecessarily harsh and he thought I was carelessly lenient. We spent our time patrolling different areas of the zone so we didn't run into each other unless we needed backup and I often heard "I'm glad it's you because I thought it was that other asshole when I saw your truck" when I made contact with people because he wrote a ticket to 90% of the people he talked to and I was the opposite and only ticketed about 10%. A couple of years later our captain retired and SC was ultimately promoted to fill the position. I told an admin friend of mine before the decision was announced that if SC got the job I would be fired within a year and he laughed and said I was crazy. During an operation on the side of a mountain in 110 degree weather after vomiting from heat exhaustion and suffering from dehydration I did something that had been common practice at every previous operation. That action was mentioned in passing to my captain while he was being debriefed on the operation and he in turn had me suspended for it. He then used that suspension as justification to place both restrictions and requirements on my job performance. The requirements placed on me would have forced me to violate the personal code of ethics I established when I became a cop in order to comply with them so I complied with them to the extent my morals allowed. 13 months after assuming the role of Patrol Captain he arrived at my home unannounced at 5:43 pm while I was cooking dinner on my day off with another officer as backup and fired me in front of my wife and children and then waited in my driveway as I spent 45 minutes collecting all of my issued uniforms and equipment and then inventoried each item individually. He told me that because he would be unavailable until then, I could meet him 4 days later and he would escort me to collect my personal property from my office. I fought it for a year with the union and eventually accepted a settlement that allowed me to resign in lieu of termination and gave me just enough money to go away. I took that money and bought into an existing tow company and signed a contract that allowed me to open my own branch and operate under the same name and the company would provide a truck and an experienced driver for 20% of my gross. I never got the truck or the driver and closed 6 months later after making a total of $80 for taking 8 gallons of gas to a boat that ran out on the lake in my personal vehicle. I blamed myself for failing to do my due diligence about the company before signing the contract and chalked it up to a very expensive lesson learned. I then got a job as a radio technician at a communications company that serviced and installed communication and emergency equipment on fire and law enforcement vehicles but 1 week before the end of my 90 day probation period I was terminated by the owner without cause or explanation other than "it's just not gonna work out" after receiving a stellar performance review from my immediate supervisor 2 weeks prior. Thank God those right to work laws exist to protect the employee from government intrusion! I spent the next few years in a pretty dark place as my wife's condition worsened and I continually tried and failed to find a job even in fast food and we were eventually evicted from our house. My wife and the kids went to stay with her family and I stayed locally with my Dad as I tried to figure out what to do and after 2 grueling stressful months we were able to get into a house on Section 8. The fact that our marriage was able to survive those years is a testament to the committed we both have to our marriage (our 2nd each) because there are few couples who can pull through that intact. By this time I had not had a job for almost 6 years and because everything had stabilized and I was going crazy I started looking for a job again. My wife hasn't been able to drive for years so I was limited on the hours I could work and ended up working the graveyard shift in a gas station which is ironic because that's what the majority of my work history was before getting that job at the assembly plant so my career arch had become a circle and I was right back where I started from as a teenager. I didn't mind it though because next to being a cop working behind the counter in a gas station is the most enjoyable job I've ever had. I accepted the job with a clear understanding between the manager and I that I had to work full time with 2 consecutive days off that didn't change week to week because we would have to schedule the bulk of my wife's regular doctor's appointments around them. Once I started working full time we no longer qualified for Section 8 ($875/month) or food stamps ($423/month) and we were kicked off so all in all my earned income of $1,600/mo cost my household $1,298 in public assistance which meant I was working full time for $302/month. After 6 weeks my hours were cut to 32/wk (now earning $1,280/mo) and after three months they were cut to 28 ($1,120/mo) when the manager "helped a friend out" and hired them because they needed a job and we split the available days. Just past my 6 month mark a customer on foot who came in regularly entered the store while I was doing the outside trashes. When I got inside he still grabbing his items and we had some small talk while I rang him up and then he left. When I came to work the following night I was informed that before I got into the store the guy had reached across the counter and stole $80 worth of lottery tickets and I was fired. Again. From a gas station. Talk about soul crushing. While my wife was in the rehab hospital we found out that she qualified for home healthcare services due to her injury at no charge based on our income. The number of hours of assistance per day is determined based on the particular disability and need and if your spouse is capable of performing them they can be paid for a portion of them so we did that when she got home. They determined the number of hours she was eligible for and then subtracted certain things that the spouse of a disabled person would normally be expected to do like grocery shopping, housework, and errands. At the beginning I was eligible for 7 hours a week at minimum wage but those hours have increased incrementally as her condition has declined and I'm now getting 35 hours/week but I've only been at level for a month and before that it was only 16 hours. How am I doing? Well I turn 40 in less than two weeks and aside from my wife I only have one true friend in the world that I talk to several times a week on Facebook but we haven't seen each other in over a decade and my wife and I have no local friends at all so it's basically just the two of us. I have no money in the bank and nothing saved in any kind of retirement account with little to no hope of either of those changing in the future. I have kids that I can be proud of, two of which have already moved out, one of whom is married and receiving an associates degree in 6 weeks and will earn a 2nd one at the end of the fall semester later this year making her the first person in my family tree to earn a college degree and that means so much to me that tears are streaming down my face as I type this. Her sister hates my guts and wants nothing to do with me and has little contact with my wife much to her disappointment. She was here for her sister's birthday a couple of weeks ago for about 6 hours and during that time didn't acknowledge me once and only talked with my wife for about 20 minutes. Within the next 2 years my younger two kids will get their high school diplomas which will give me something my Dad's kids didn't provide him because none oh his children earned a diploma and only two of them went on the get a GED. I have a wife that for reasons I can't figure out loves me far more than I deserve and compliments my life in ways I can't describe and the absolute best possible future I have to hope for is to watch her slowly deteriorate until some complication from her condition kills her, she commits suicide (or worse enlists me to assist), or my cowardice wins out and I run away when I finally reach my breaking point. I don't hate the doctor that injured my wife, lord knows she hates her enough for 10 people with good reason, but I do not have the time, luxury, or energy to devote to it and it wouldn't improve my situation anyway. All I can do is wake up in the morning and roll with whatever the day has in store for me as best I can. I can't break down, I can't take a day off, and I can't quit because I'm the only thing holding all of this together and if I crack it ruins a family. So the answer to how I'm doing is, the best that can be expected under these circumstances. If you've read this far thank you for your interest in my story, I know it was a wall of text. A few of the things I'm hoping people will take away from my story are: * Not every cop is looking for a reason to abuse their power and bust you for every little thing and I have been genuinely hurt by comments made by people during a controversial event involving a cop and I know I'm far from the only one. Good cops hate dirty cops more than you do. * Not every chronic pain patient collecting disability is cheating the system, and after navigating that process myself I'm inclined to say that almost no one is. * Not everyone working a menial minimum wage job is there because they have no education, training, or experience deserving of a higher wage. Most of them are there due to circumstances beyond their control and when one of those individuals hears people say that minimum wage should not support a family it's impossible not to take that personally because often times the family was constructed under better circumstances. * The hoops I had to jump through and the paperwork I had to provide in order to qualify for food stamps, unemployment, Medi-Cal, section 8, and cash aid would make it virtually impossible for an undocumented illegal immigrant to receive any of them. * You can go from earning $75k/yr to collecting everything mentioned in the previous bullet in the span of two weeks so be careful how you characterize the people collecting them because it's possible that they were willing to take a bullet for you a few weeks ago and would be willing to do so today even without being paid for it. **Disclaimer:** There is a giant elephant in the room related to my wife's injury and in order to head off any questions involving it I will say that I have been advised not to discuss it so please don't ask. That in itself should answer the question. ***Full Disclosure*** Because this was an elaboration and not a confession I omitted things from my story that were incredibly relevant but are too shameful to admit even to strangers on the internet so I sound far more innocent than I deserve for some of the things that have happened to me and my family. Thanks for reading.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2017-03-29 19:56:01</DATE>
    <TEXT>Someone asked me these questions a couple of days during a [discussion on the feasibility of unemployed and poor people moving to another location](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/61nd1j/what_is_the_best_example_of_an_out_of_touch_with/dffzcrn/?st=j0u9ud34 amp;sh=df051387) for better job prospects, and after composing my response I decided to post it here instead and provide the asker with a link. Be prepared for a wall of text and to save you the trouble of looking I'll say in advance that there is no TL;DR at the bottom. My wife's family lives in the toxic town that we just left (well 10 years ago lol) because there's nothing there that provides anyone a meaningful future. My MIL is a wonderful woman who embraced me as a member of her family immediately and without her help for a few years we would not have survived. She has been more of a Mother to me over the last 10 years than my own Mother was for the previous 30 and there's nothing I could ever do to accurately express the amount of gratitude I have for her. Unfortunately her marriage has been filled with verbal, emotional, and I suspect physical abuse and she is miserable but won't leave. She deals with her misery by meddling in the lives of her children to the extent they will allow, and my wife is her favorite target because she won't stand up for herself and her other two sisters will. She's been working as a CNA in a hospital for over 30 and as a result both knows a lot and doesn't know enough at the same time. She is constantly second guessing both my wife and her doctors, she expects the worst case scenario for every situation and makes sure to go into detail on what the worst is. If we lived in the same town her Mother would smother her and the fits of frustration and anxiety she experiences after their almost daily phone calls would happen multiple times a day. There is nothing that town offers that would be an improvement to my current situation lol. My younger brother just spent his savings to move my Dad from here to where he lives last summer. We were talking somewhat regularly for the last couple of years but I haven't heard from him since then. I heard through the grapevine that they're getting married this summer which is great because from what I could observe during the week they were here she's really good for him and he loves the hell out of her. He's marrying into 4 kids under 11 and I have been in that exact position before so I know he's got his hands full and I hope he knows what he's getting himself in to because that can be a rough road. I've probably seen or talked to my older brother half a dozen times over the last 20 years. I have no explanation for the lack of contact other than life gets in the way. We both went in different directions when I was 17 and our paths just never really crossed again and every time we talk on the phone it feels uncomfortable and forced because we really don't know much about each other after the age of 18 and we're usually only talking because it's a holiday or something. He's never been married but he's been living with his girlfriend and her 3 kids for I don't even know how many years. At present none of us has fathered a male child so unless that changes in the future our family name dies with us. That's something I think about every once in awhile because it's both kind of a big thing and essentially meaningless at the same time. My Dad is on a fixed income and when I moved him from a town where he knew no one to a town 10 minutes from me where he also knew no one [but me] he was emotionally devastated from one of the most cruel things I've ever seen a person do to their spouse and a few years later was essentially crippled with depression and sitting in his apartment just paying bills and waiting to die. I tried to be there for him as best I could but our relationship had suffered the same fate as my older brothers and we just never talked much after I left at 17 and this was the first time we had spent any significant time together in more than 15 years and we quickly discovered that we didn't have a whole lot in common, we didn't have a whole lot to talk about, our politics couldn't be more different and he entered the picture too late for my emotionally awkward kids to form any sort of meaningful attachment with him even though I'll give him credit for putting in the effort because he tried harder to bond with them than he did with me when I was their age and although he never even hinted at it, I know the rejection poured alcohol on his existing emotional wounds. With very few misses he came to our house for dinner every Sunday and we'd watch football or a movie during the off season. We encouraged him to come more but he said he'd feel like he was intruding or keeping us from doing other things just to entertain him. After my wife's injury he started to feel like a burden to my already heavy load and negotiated the move with my brother and told me after the plans were finalized. He is doing much better since the move, he's getting out of his apartment and he's spending a lot of time with the grand kids. I don't think he'll ever fully recover from what his wife did to him and I know without a doubt that he'll never date again but I'm glad to see he's able to enjoy himself again. In all likelihood, short of a financial windfall, he will probably pass away before I see him again. My mother's husband died last fall just shy of their 20th anniversary which forced her back into the workforce for the first time in 30 years because she has MS and Addison's disease, so the woman who was an RN in a previous life now makes minimum wage in a shoe store, but she can't work too much or she'll lose her disability since she's still a few years shy of qualifying for SS, which won't improve her situation or allow her to stop working. Thankfully she's got an amazing emotional support group and she is surrounded by her sisters and Father and friends. I worry about her though because she's not adjusting well to being a widow and she's said a few things that put thoughts in your head, you know? My Mother has been good at a lot of things in her life, but being alone isn't one of them so even if suicide isn't an issue dying of a broken heart or losing the will to live is. In all likelihood, short of a financial windfall, she will probably pass away before I see her again. My wife had a routine knee surgery in 2008 that triggered a cascading series events that ultimately resulted in her having 17 surgeries between then and now and being on disability since 2011 due to Complex Regional Pain Syndrome or CRPS. 2 years ago she had surgery to have a spinal cord simulator implanted and woke up numb from the waist down. She could move her legs and feet (well as much as she could before anyway) and feel her normal pain on the inside of her leg but she had no sensation on the skin at all and she said it felt like her feet weighed 500 pounds each. Over the next few days she had 4 more surgeries trying to find the cause of the numbness and the implant was removed during the last one. She slowly regained sensation in her left leg over the course of a couple of weeks but it never came back in her right. She learned how to walk again in a rehab hospital where she spent 3 weeks and the surgeon spent the next 6 months scheduling a monthly appointment so they could ask if there was any improvement, tell us how sorry they were, and explain again that they don't know what happened and nothing like this has ever happened before, ok come see me next month and remember, keep your hopes up it can take up to 6 months to regain feeling after something like this. At the end of the 6 months the surgeon said there wasn't anything more they could do and discharged her as a patient. We eventually learned that she has spinal cord damage at the location of the surgery that's visible on an MRI. The stimulator was the only treatment option for CRPS available to her that she hadn't already tried and a year after the last surgery she tried it again with another surgeon 5 hours away that specialized in difficult stimulator cases. The surgery was successful in that she did not come out of it worse off than when she went in (this can only be said of about 4 of the 17 surgeries she's undergone) but we found out a couple of weeks later that the stimulator wasn't working properly. She was feeling stimulation in places she wasn't supposed to and not feeling it in the places that she should. An xray was ordered to verify it was positioned correctly during the post-op appointment and we were told that the Rep for the implant company would contact us to schedule an appointment so they could check out the programing. After that they basically stopped answering her calls, never returned messages, and hasn't seen her since and it's not like we can just stop into the office or something. She called the rep all the time but could never leave a message due to a full voicemail and we eventually learned that he no longer worked for the company. A few months later we were at one of our son's football games and she moved her leg to adjust her position and got a pain in her thigh that brought her to tears by the end of the game. Over the next week or two she slowly started losing muscle function in her right leg, she was having hot flashes, her BP went through the roof and she nearly panicked the office when it was 196/132 one day, and she noticed she had lost some peripheral vision. All of these problems coincided with her pain specialist of 6 years admitting that he had reached the limit of his knowledge on how to treat her condition and would be referring her to a larger clinic 60 miles away, and her primary care doctor of 9 years discharging her as a patient due to a billing policy change. She got into one doctor who thought her symptoms indicated a very aggressive form of MS and she needed a brain MRI immediately to confirm. As it turned out the "MRI compatible" implant she had put in was only compatible under certain conditions and there's no imaging place within 200 miles that's either willing or able to meet those conditions. We knew she would need annual or bi-annual MRI's to monitor the spinal injury and had the surgeon been clear about the compatibility issues she wouldn't have done the surgery in the first place. She was able to convince a surgeon we trust to remove the implant but he was very blunt about the risk and said odds are 70% that she would wake up from the surgery a paraplegic but thankfully that didn't happen because he's a fucking rock star. The brain MRI ruled out MS so we were back to square one. The new pain clinic declined to take her case because it was too challenging and after that we had to go find specialists ourselves and then find a doctor willing to write a referral because she won't be established with her new primary doctor until the end of April. We got a referral and drove 4 hours one way (6.5 to get back due to traffic) to get to Stanford Med Center and they suggested that UC Davis might be a better option and thanked us for coming in. We found out later that the doctor never intended to take her case and only saw her as a "courtesy" which makes me question her understand of what it means to be courteous. After playing 'find a referring doctor' again and sending them her records UC Davis also declined to take her case stating they were at capacity and couldn't take on such a challenging case at this time. Last August my wife was in rough shape but she was walking unassisted 90% of the time and used a cane the other 10% on bad days or after over doing it; today she needs a wheelchair to do anything outside the house more involved than walking into a gas station and back. The paralysis has gone untreated this entire time because for individually legitimate reasons she's lost all of her doctors at the same time and now nobody wants to take on the liability associated with taking on a patient with a spinal cord injury and a few days ago her left foot cramped and she said the pain feels just like the pain that started the loss of muscle function. She had her first session with a psychologist today and it went really well which is great because I believe it's something she desperately needs. She told me that the doctor said after 3-4 visits she'd like to begin including me in the sessions as well so I can be a part of her treatment which is probably a good idea because I could probably benefit from it as well. My story? When I was 20 I was working at an assembly plant making too much money to quit but not enough to succeed building about 1200 parts per shift at a bench. 3 of the other 8 benches were occupied by people who had been occupying them for 10-15 years and the woman at the front supervising had been at that position for 19 years^and ^had ^the ^personality ^to ^prove ^it so I joined the Navy because fuck that. Well actually I joined the Navy because my first call was to the Air Force and they disqualified me after I admitted to using LSD in the past. Then I called the Marines because they've got kick ass dress uniforms and they disqualified me because I had a GED instead of a diploma (Holy fuck am I ever so thankful that they did that because I would not have made a very good marine and I would have been miserable). Then I called the Navy (I was not calling the Army even if the Navy said no) and after some playful banter that indicated I should keep my fucking mouth shut about my drug history and the handful of failure to appear warrants for traffic tickets I had at the time and come into the office and see them so I did. I tested, went through a physical, picked a job, and off to boot camp I went. Aside from getting in shape I was actually disappointed in boot camp and at the end thought ***that's it??*** I spent the next 9 years fixing communication, navigation, and electronic warfare equipment on jets which was pretty awesome for a guy who spent his childhood building model airplanes and hanging them from his ceiling in mock dog fights as he dreamed of being a pilot. The Navy changed the rules for retirement near the end of my first enlistment by removing the ability for an E-5 to serve for 20 years and earn a retirement; instead they would be discharging them without benefits at 14 years if they fail to advance to E-6 by then. I was able to time my reenlistment so that my next contract would expire before I crossed 10 years of service because I didn't like the idea of crossing that line without a guaranteed retirement. When the time came to make the decision I was recently married to a woman with 4 young children between 5 and 9 and if I stayed in I would be transferring to sea duty where I would spend the next 4 years bouncing in and out for varying lengths of time including at least 2 and possibly 3 six month deployments and an equal number of 6 week deployments leading up to them. Around year 7 I was caught doing something that is common practice but not discussed because when it's discovered it must be acted on. Because I told the truth when confronted they were forced to act on it and I was made an example of. At my Captain's Mast my CO asked me "why are you here?" after asking a few preliminary questions and being unable to figure out what I had done wrong so I had to explain it to him. Considering the possible consequences I was lucky that the only thing it cost me was the duty station of my dreams that had fallen into my lap when I was up for transfer in a year, what little reputation I had been able to build as a middle-of-the-road sailor on my best day, and two consecutive evaluation scores that would make advancement impossible for several years. I crunched the numbers and found out that even if I scored perfect on the test each time it was mathematically impossible for me to advance to E-6 before 14 years so I started job hunting. I accepted a job as a federal law enforcement officer with the US Forest Service in a city I'd never heard of in the next state over that would give us a 4 hour buffer between my wife and her family and off we went. We had only been there for 3-4 months when I left for the police academy on the other side of the country for 21 weeks. I am not the kind of guy that pops into people's head when they think cop; I would never be confused with an Alpha personality and I am generally annoyed by them, I'm a left leaning liberal, I avoid confrontation whenever possible (but am able to step up when the situation demands it), I hate working out, and I might be the least motivated person I've ever known. I've learned that when I can do nothing I will do nothing so the key to keeping me on track is a tight schedule, because if I have something to do I can't do nothing. For that reason among others I excelled in every area of the police academy except the physical fitness part and I was only *just able* to pass the fitness requirements although I was injured at the time which they acknowledged but it was the last opportunity I had to pass so if I failed I was going home without a job in a city I don't know to a wife and 4 kids depending on me to pay the bills after ripping them away from everything they've ever known a few months after meeting me and then leaving them a few months later. Between those upheavals, future field training, and the long hours on the job I was only ever able to really forge a bond with the oldest and as far as she is concerned I'm her Dad even though she calls me by my first name. Unlike the older two (who share a father that never laid eyes on the younger one), the younger two had their biological father active in their lives so the dynamic between us was different and I've always just kinda been the guy that married their mom. We're family but there's no real affection from them and after years of awkward rejections I stopped trying. As far as I'm concerned they are my kids and I love them as if they were, but to them I'm viewed more as an authority figure than one of their parents. The other one needs someone to hate and she has named me as that designated person and beyond that I'd rather not kick that particular hornet's nest of emotions. After I graduated from the police academy I was required to complete 3 months of field training that could take place anywhere in the country a month at a time before I was clear to go patrol on my own. When I got back home I was assured by my captain that it would take 3-6 months for me to receive my first FTO assignment and I would ride passenger with another officer or do office work until then. When we moved my wife quit her job instead of taking a transfer because she had been putting off knee surgery for years and she wanted to be able to get settled and get that repaired before she went back to work so she scheduled it now that I was back and could take care of the house while she recovered. The day after the surgery my captain called me and told me that assignments had just come in and I was leaving for 2 months two days from now. I had no choice but to leave and she had no choice but to be a single mother of 4 children which doesn't lend itself to recovery very well. All 3 of the FTOs that I trained under were just like me and we all worked very well together. They were laid back and easy going, they were the smiling cop that approached your campsite to chat and see how you're doing, not to look for a reason to write you a ticket. We wrote tickets when the situation dictated and issued warnings when it didn't. It was exactly the kind of atmosphere that I was hoping to find when I chose the forest service over the highway patrol job I was about to be offered a few weeks later and this was shaping up to be the best job I ever had. Once I had completed training my captain gave me priority areas and crimes to concentrate on and the freedom to pretty much set my own schedule. My office was 25 miles away from my direct supervisor and with the exception of assigned days off I was given the freedom to set my own hours and work anywhere within my patrol zone that I wanted. I spent my first year figuring out who I was as a cop and exploring the 2.3 million acres I was responsible for patrolling which includes some of the best scenery in the state. I chose to operate like the friendly forest ranger and I found it more rewarding and beneficial to educate people about not only what the laws were but why they were put in place and why they're important than it was to just write tickets all day. My ticket count may have been low but my real world results were beginning to materialize when Super Cop transferred in to fill a position that had been vacant in my patrol zone for years. SC was the kind of guy that pop's into your head when you think LAPD SWAT and although we didn't butt heads we didn't get along from the start because I thought he was unnecessarily harsh and he thought I was carelessly lenient. We spent our time patrolling different areas of the zone so we didn't run into each other unless we needed backup and I often heard "I'm glad it's you because I thought it was that other asshole when I saw your truck" when I made contact with people because he wrote a ticket to 90% of the people he talked to and I was the opposite and only ticketed about 10%. A couple of years later our captain retired and SC was ultimately promoted to fill the position. I told an admin friend of mine before the decision was announced that if SC got the job I would be fired within a year and he laughed and said I was crazy. During an operation on the side of a mountain in 110 degree weather after vomiting from heat exhaustion and suffering from dehydration I did something that had been common practice at every previous operation. That action was mentioned in passing to my captain while he was being debriefed on the operation and he in turn had me suspended for it. He then used that suspension as justification to place both restrictions and requirements on my job performance. The requirements placed on me would have forced me to violate the personal code of ethics I established when I became a cop in order to comply with them so I complied with them to the extent my morals allowed. 13 months after assuming the role of Patrol Captain he arrived at my home unannounced at 5:43 pm while I was cooking dinner on my day off with another officer as backup and fired me in front of my wife and children and then waited in my driveway as I spent 45 minutes collecting all of my issued uniforms and equipment and then inventoried each item individually. He told me that because he would be unavailable until then, I could meet him 4 days later and he would escort me to collect my personal property from my office. I fought it for a year with the union and eventually accepted a settlement that allowed me to resign in lieu of termination and gave me just enough money to go away. I took that money and bought into an existing tow company and signed a contract that allowed me to open my own branch and operate under the same name and the company would provide a truck and an experienced driver for 20% of my gross. I never got the truck or the driver and closed 6 months later after making a total of $80 for taking 8 gallons of gas to a boat that ran out on the lake in my personal vehicle. I blamed myself for failing to do my due diligence about the company before signing the contract and chalked it up to a very expensive lesson learned. I then got a job as a radio technician at a communications company that serviced and installed communication and emergency equipment on fire and law enforcement vehicles but 1 week before the end of my 90 day probation period I was terminated by the owner without cause or explanation other than "it's just not gonna work out" after receiving a stellar performance review from my immediate supervisor 2 weeks prior. Thank God those right to work laws exist to protect the employee from government intrusion! I spent the next few years in a pretty dark place as my wife's condition worsened and I continually tried and failed to find a job even in fast food and we were eventually evicted from our house. My wife and the kids went to stay with her family and I stayed locally with my Dad as I tried to figure out what to do and after 2 grueling stressful months we were able to get into a house on Section 8. The fact that our marriage was able to survive those years is a testament to the committed we both have to our marriage (our 2nd each) because there are few couples who can pull through that intact. By this time I had not had a job for almost 6 years and because everything had stabilized and I was going crazy I started looking for a job again. My wife hasn't been able to drive for years so I was limited on the hours I could work and ended up working the graveyard shift in a gas station which is ironic because that's what the majority of my work history was before getting that job at the assembly plant so my career arch had become a circle and I was right back where I started from as a teenager. I didn't mind it though because next to being a cop working behind the counter in a gas station is the most enjoyable job I've ever had. I accepted the job with a clear understanding between the manager and I that I had to work full time with 2 consecutive days off that didn't change week to week because we would have to schedule the bulk of my wife's regular doctor's appointments around them. Once I started working full time we no longer qualified for Section 8 ($875/month) or food stamps ($423/month) and we were kicked off so all in all my earned income of $1,600/mo cost my household $1,298 in public assistance which meant I was working full time for $302/month. After 6 weeks my hours were cut to 32/wk (now earning $1,280/mo) and after three months they were cut to 28 ($1,120/mo) when the manager "helped a friend out" and hired them because they needed a job and we split the available days. Just past my 6 month mark a customer on foot who came in regularly entered the store while I was doing the outside trashes. When I got inside he still grabbing his items and we had some small talk while I rang him up and then he left. When I came to work the following night I was informed that before I got into the store the guy had reached across the counter and stole $80 worth of lottery tickets and I was fired. Again. From a gas station. Talk about soul crushing. While my wife was in the rehab hospital we found out that she qualified for home healthcare services due to her injury at no charge based on our income. The number of hours of assistance per day is determined based on the particular disability and need and if your spouse is capable of performing them they can be paid for a portion of them so we did that when she got home. They determined the number of hours she was eligible for and then subtracted certain things that the spouse of a disabled person would normally be expected to do like grocery shopping, housework, and errands. At the beginning I was eligible for 7 hours a week at minimum wage but those hours have increased incrementally as her condition has declined and I'm now getting 35 hours/week but I've only been at level for a month and before that it was only 16 hours. How am I doing? Well I turn 40 in less than two weeks and aside from my wife I only have one true friend in the world that I talk to several times a week on Facebook but we haven't seen each other in over a decade and my wife and I have no local friends at all so it's basically just the two of us. I have no money in the bank and nothing saved in any kind of retirement account with little to no hope of either of those changing in the future. I have kids that I can be proud of, two of which have already moved out, one of whom is married and receiving an associates degree in 6 weeks and will earn a 2nd one at the end of the fall semester later this year making her the first person in my family tree to earn a college degree and that means so much to me that tears are streaming down my face as I type this. Her sister hates my guts and wants nothing to do with me and has little contact with my wife much to her disappointment. She was here for her sister's birthday a couple of weeks ago for about 6 hours and during that time didn't acknowledge me once and only talked with my wife for about 20 minutes. Within the next 2 years my younger two kids will get their high school diplomas which will give me something my Dad's kids didn't provide him because none oh his children earned a diploma and only two of them went on the get a GED. I have a wife that for reasons I can't figure out loves me far more than I deserve and compliments my life in ways I can't describe and the absolute best possible future I have to hope for is to watch her slowly deteriorate until some complication from her condition kills her, she commits suicide (or worse enlists me to assist), or my cowardice wins out and I run away when I finally reach my breaking point. I don't hate the doctor that injured my wife, lord knows she hates her enough for 10 people with good reason, but I do not have the time, luxury, or energy to devote to it and it wouldn't improve my situation anyway. All I can do is wake up in the morning and roll with whatever the day has in store for me as best I can. I can't break down, I can't take a day off, and I can't quit because I'm the only thing holding all of this together and if I crack it ruins a family. I'm about $7,000 behind on my rent, my power bill is around $850, and I haven't had propane for heat for 7 months so we use individual space heaters for our bedrooms. The owner of the house we live in passed away a year ago without a will. The house in owned by a trust that was in his name and his estate has a debt attached to it that's larger that the cash value and the only asset large enough to cover it is my home. The estate hasn't started the probate process yet and I have no idea what we're going to do when that happens. So the answer to how I'm doing is, the best that can be expected under these circumstances. If you've read this far thank you for your interest in my story, I know it was a wall of text. A few of the things I'm hoping people will take away from my story are: * Not every cop is looking for a reason to abuse their power and bust you for every little thing and I have been genuinely hurt by comments made by people during a controversial event involving a cop and I know I'm far from the only one. Good cops hate dirty cops more than you do. * Not every chronic pain patient collecting disability is cheating the system, and after navigating that process myself I'm inclined to say that almost no one is. * Not everyone working a menial minimum wage job is there because they have no education, training, or experience deserving of a higher wage. Most of them are there due to circumstances beyond their control and when one of those individuals hears people say that minimum wage should not support a family it's impossible not to take that personally because often times the family was constructed under better circumstances. * The hoops I had to jump through and the paperwork I had to provide in order to qualify for food stamps, unemployment, Medi-Cal, section 8, and cash aid would make it virtually impossible for an undocumented illegal immigrant to receive any of them. * You can go from earning $75k/yr to collecting everything mentioned in the previous bullet in the span of two weeks so be careful how you characterize the people collecting them because it's possible that they were willing to take a bullet for you a few weeks ago and would be willing to do so today even without being paid for it. **Disclaimer:** There is a giant elephant in the room related to my wife's injury and in order to head off any questions involving it I will say that I have been advised not to discuss it so please don't ask. That in itself should answer the question. ***Full Disclosure*** Because this was an elaboration and not a confession I omitted things from my story that were incredibly relevant but are too shameful to admit even to strangers on the internet so I sound far more innocent than I deserve for some of the things that have happened to me and my family. Thanks for reading.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2017-04-06 02:29:28</DATE>
    <TEXT>Something happened yesterday that I didn't know how to respond to at the time, and to a degree I still don't, so I wanted to put it on trial in the court of public opinion. I had a root canal performed on a broken tooth in February and the broken portion was reconstructed using whatever black magic sculpting technique they use for that process. They made an appointment to have a permanent crown made and installed a couple of months later and when I got to that appointment yesterday I was numbed and the Dr came in and ground my tooth down to a little nub and then said she would be stepping away and someone else would step in to create and install my temporary crown. When that person came in I asked about the 'temporary' comment made by the Dr and was told that the Dr that installs permanent crowns was out that day and everyone else was only able to do temporary ones so they would give me a temporary one today and I would have to come back on Monday (6 days later) to get the permanent one made and installed. In my mind they performed a completely unnecessary and expensive dental procedure essentially without my knowledge or consent until beyond the point of no return instead of just rescheduling my appointment for 6 days later. I wouldn't sue them even if I could, which I don't think I could anyway, but I am considering putting in a formal complaint of fraud/abuse through my insurance company. Before I do though I had a few questions. 1. Do you think it was insurance fraud/abuse? 2. Does the fact that I have tax payer funded insurance influence your opinion because essentially you paid for it? 3. Does it matter whether my insurance is publicly funded or purchased on the open market? Because even with conventional insurance other people would be footing the bill to cover the cost of unnecessary procedures in the form of higher premiums? 4. Do you think I am a victim of malpractice? Edit to add more information: When I woke up this morning the temporary crown was laying loose in my mouth after popping off at some point while sleeping which required another appointment this afternoon (that once again you paid for) where they re-cemented it in place.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2017-05-08 00:47:10</DATE>
    <TEXT>My wife (via her attorney) filed a civil medical malpractice suit on Feb 24 and the doctor was served on that same day. The notice served on the doctor stated "You have 30 calendar days after this summons and legal papers are served on you to file a written response at this court and have a copy served on the plaintiff". "A letter or phone call will not protect you." and "If you do not file your response on time, you may lose the case by default, and your wages, money, and property may be taken without further warning from the court". The doctor's response was "served" on Apr 27 by placing a copy of the response in the mail addressed to my wife's attorney and filed in the court on May 1st. Is this likely to have any effect on the case? Or will the court forgive the late response since it was only a few days?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is going to be unpopular but it needs to be said. It's only been 24 hours and I am already sick to death of hearing about Chris Cornell. This man had a wife, three children, more money than most people earn in a lifetime of backbreaking work, a career that is a pipe dream for most people, and a network of people dedicated to giving him whatever he wanted or needed. In spite of all that he took his own life in one of the most selfish ways possible and everyone looses their shit. I've seen posts from people who think their fellow countrymen and women should die if they can't afford insurance lamenting the loss of this rock star who HAD IT ALL and didn't seek treatment. Fuck Chris Cornell! If you want to shed a tear over someone's suicide, shed them for the 22 veterans every day that kill themselves because our government wrote them off as expendable garbage after forcing them do to things that psychologically scarred them for life. So I'll say it again, fuck Chris Cornell!!!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>An Open Letter to Teenagers and Young Adults</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-05-27 07:52:13</DATE>
    <TEXT>You're either just about done with high school or already out, and regardless of whether you go on to college or enter the workforce your childhood is essentially over. You will be expected to act like an adult from now until the day you die...and even when you're not sure how an adult should act in a given situation you'll be expected to 'wing it' convincingly. I am by no means a religious man, and I rarely quote the Bible unironically, but 1st Corinthians Chapter 13 Verse 11 is incredibly relevant to young people entering adulthood. "When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things." It's time to put away childish things and figure out who you're going to be for the rest of your life. The person you are at 18 isn't the person you'll be at 21, and that person will be vastly different from the person you'll be at 30, so if you don't control the transformation the transformation will control you and you may not be happy with the metamorphosis. I hope that you are able to get through the current turmoil plaguing this country and the world unscathed, and I wish nothing but the best for your future...because YOUR future is OUR future. Eventually it'll be you and your peers running things and I firmly believe that your generation has the potential to be the best one yet in spite of the insults and rhetoric lobbed in your direction. Please don't let us down because there are a lot of people depending on you living up to that potential and fixing the shit that is wrong with our societies, our governments, and our planet as a whole. I know you didn't "start the fire" but you will be damn sure responsible for putting it out because if you don't, your children will have to and I don't want to see you do to them what's been done to you.

    <DATE>2017-06-15 01:27:31</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've seen a lot of people condemning the violence that took place in Virginia today, and while I do not support the actions taken by the shooter, I disagree with the sentiment that we do not solve our problems with violence. This country was founded by people who used violence to achieve their goals. Our military uses violence overseas on a daily basis to achieve our government's goals. Our governments (Federal, State, and Local) use violence against citizens on a daily basis to achieve their goals. Our citizens use violence daily against each other to achieve their goals. Violence is the most effective tool available in the tool box to effect change quickly, it only becomes a bad thing when that violence is directed at you or those you support. When our elected leaders become more concerned with party politics and political power and influence than they are with what's best for the country, violence is the only tool available to the people to rip control of the country back from those wishing to do it harm. This wasn't an incident of a mentally ill person shooting up a school, or a church, or a workplace. This was an individual who felt abandoned by the government that is supposed to look out for him and felt the most effective move he could make was to refresh the tree of liberty with the blood of patriots and tyrants...just as our founding father's intended.  gt;The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants. -Thomas Jefferson</TEXT>

    <TITLE>An open letter to my State Representative Doug LaMalfa</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-10-17 08:00:04</DATE>
    <TEXT>Mr. LaMalfa, I just finished reading an opinion piece you penned about tax reform that was [published in the Record Searchlight newspaper](http://www.redding.com/story/opinion/readers/2017/10/09/its-now-never-tax-relief/737864001/) which serves Redding and northern California and I had the following response: Let me set the stage for you. It #8217;s 2017, Donald Trump is President and working hard to start a decades long Cold War by encouraging a reportedly unhinged dictator to cause the worst nuclear disaster in history. In the U.S., manufacturing jobs are at an all time low due to outsourcing, and  #8220;Idiocracy #8221; is becoming a self fulfilling prophecy instead of the poor excuse for a comedy it was intended to be. The nation has watched in horror as the current administration reversed our nation #8217;s stance on climate change denying that it exists in the face of mountains of evidence proving its validity, reversed our nation #8217;s stance on LGBT rights, and is working diligently and feverishly to strip healthcare away from as many Americans as legislatively possible. That #8217;s present day USA, and the most pressing issue my elected Representative wants to address is the tax code that has tripled in size over the last 30 years. Tax laws have tripled in size and become more complex than ever due directly to influence on our government at the hands of the business community. They have spent years and a vast and untold amount of money successfully lobbying the government to ensure that even though American businesses face the highest corporate tax rate in the developed world, virtually none of them actually pay that effective rate, and in fact a very large number pay nothing or nearly nothing while enjoying all of the benefits of operating in the best nation on the planet. Meanwhile American workers are at a steep disadvantage compared to foreign competitors and many are finding it impossible to make their American Dream a reality no matter how hard they work to achieve it. In recent history, America led the world in manufacturing  #8211; these days we lag far behind. As things stand, our economy has increased in size and price beyond the point of affordability and has become a burden on most Americans. So where do we go from here? You would have me believe that giving small business, corporations, and the wealthy a generous tax break will allow them to keep more of their money, which they could then use to expand their business, create jobs, and grow the economy. In fact, a recent White House report predicted an increase of $4,000 a year in worker wages based off of their proposed tax cuts, but is that what would actually happen? Historically speaking, both yes and no. To start with, a business on its own is incapable of creating a job no matter how much money they have on hand, only demand for a business #8217;s product beyond its current ability to meet can create a job, and businesses that meet that definition have access to a near infinite amount of money to expand if they so choose. Secondly, a business only spends money if it will either save them money, or make them money, and since labor is often the largest expense a business has, spending money to save labor costs is always looked upon favorably, so I do not feel it is in the best interests of the average American to support corporate tax cuts that provide them no benefit and saddle them with large amounts of risk. The average American works for a company that is asking for tax breaks. Some of the money gained from those tax breaks will be used to invest in technology that allows 1 employee to do the work previously done by 3 providing the business a large reduction in labor costs which prompts them to give the remaining employee a raise. In this scenario, the business gets a tax break that they enjoy year after year that will be used to invest in technology that reduces labor costs, 1 employee gets a raise but now does the work of 3 with a little technological help, and 2 employees collect unemployment, food stamps, welfare, and Medicaid until they are able to break into a new field which will most likely require them taking on debt to fund the education required to start a new field. Explain to me how it is in my best interest as an average American to support tax cuts that will inevitably be used to make my life more difficult while making those whose lives are immeasurably easier than mine already even easier? Corporate America abandoned the average American when they facilitated and forced our transition from a manufacturing driven economy to a consumer driven economy by outsourcing all the manufacturing overseas for the sake of higher profits. In an economy driven by manufacturing, manufacturing is all that matters, so it is necessary for businesses and corporations to have control of large sums of money in order to obtain the raw materials required to manufacture things. By turning their back on the American worker in favor of cheap international labor, Corporate American also de facto gave over control of the economy to consumers. In a manufacturing driven economy, the more that gets manufactured the more that can be sold, the more that can be sold the more money can be made, and the more money made the bigger the economy grows #8230;but that model doesn #8217;t work in a consumer driven economy. The only thing that can drive growth in a consumer driven economy is consumption, it #8217;s right there in the name. If consumers spend money the economy grows, if they don #8217;t spend money it doesn #8217;t grow, and they can #8217;t spend money if they don #8217;t have any. The only way for the U.S. to grow the economy is to increase consumption. You can #8217;t increase consumption by giving those who have more than they need already even more because to them more money doesn #8217;t equal more consumption. You increase consumption by giving the people who are more likely to spend their entire paycheck more paycheck to spend because to them, more money equals more consumption. More consumption equals more demand. More demand equals more jobs, more jobs equals more consumers, more consumers equal more demand, etc. Everyone wins. In an economy driven by manufacturing you grow the economy by giving those at the top as much as they need to manufacture as much as they can. In an economy driven by consumption you grow the economy by giving those at the bottom as much you can so they can consume as much as they want. Respectfully, A Disappointed Constituent</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ok I'm completely pulling this out of my ass because I've never used a sling but I'll try to answer your question based on the knowledge I do have. At the beginning he is facing the camera with his target to his left. This position gives the enemy the smallest possible target to hit (profile vs face to face) and provides the best chance of not getting hit himself if this were a real battle. When he starts the swing from this safer position, the momentum of the sling would carry the bullet to the left of the camera's position if he released it, so he needs to shift that momentum toward his target and that transitional across the body swing accomplishes that quite nicely and a quick reversal of direction gets the bullet heading toward the target without having to slow down first. If he started the initial swinging in the other direction (in order to avoid the reversal), the sling would be moving upwards during the release instead of downward in what I assume is a more accurate direction.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No, I was personally insulted that the population that exists under the umbrella provided by law enforcement lumps all cops in with the bad ones. I didn't discover that the bad press was warranted, because it's not, at least not to the extent that it gets. I'm not defensive about people who spread bad press, I'm defensive of people who spread unwarranted bad press and try to convict an entire profession over the sins of a select few. Bad cops are bad, and we need to do everything we can to weed them out, but expecting perfection from a group of human beings is not a realistic expectation. People want law enforcement to make zero mistakes and that's just not possible. People want law enforcement to pay the price when they cross the line, and when they're put on trial in order to achieve that those same people let them go and then blame the cops for their failure to hold them accountable.</TEXT>

If the property owners didn't have this setup, a lot of those 200k people wouldn't have anywhere to go. I get that, I really do, but at the same time that's kinda the same as saying that slaves were better off with their masters than they were in some tribe somewhere. 20 people paying $250 each to share 400 sqft, that comes out to $5,000/mo per apartment. People are getting rich from the misery of others, they aren't doing them a favor, they're outright exploiting them for profit.  gt;It's tragic and a major problem, but the solution is either funding bigger buildings, or reducing population growth. It's more than tragic, but doing this and hiding it in the shadows with illegal "dwellings" slows progress and prevents those steps from being undertaken because they're hiding the problem in these slums. If there were 200k homeless people living on the street something would've been done by now, but they aren't living on the street, it's arguably much more inhumane than that...and people are making money from it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was reading this story about 25-year-old Martha O'Donovan, an American citizen who was arrested on Saturday in Zimbabwe and charged with subversion for allegedly insulting the 93-year-old President Robert Mugabe on Twitter as a "sick man", a charge that carries a 20 year prison sentence. As I was reading through the story I kept getting angrier and angrier over the situation and when I learned that she will be held without bail over the weekend my mind started conjuring up visions of a special ops assault and rescue. That's when I got to the comment section where my faith in my country was shattered. We've all read and heard people from both sides say some pretty horrible things the past few years, and although the things that were being said here weren't exactly horrible in and of themselves (I tried to post links to screenshots but apparently I can't do that here), they were the most personally devastating comments I've ever read based on the subject matter. Is this really what we've come down to? Are our political party affiliations now more important than our bond as fellow Americans? How can anyone with an ounce of patriotism hang a fellow American out to dry like that for speaking their mind in a social media post? I'm visibly shaken by this and I hope that some of you can help restore what little faith and hope I had left for the future of this country, because those comments destroyed it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;being a citizen of the United States doesn't entitle her to move to another country and do things that are illegal there. That depends on how you view freedom of speech. If you see it as strictly an American right then sure, I can see how someone wouldn't have a problem with this. If you see freedom speech as a basic human right, as it should be, you should view this as not only a gross violation of an American right, but as a gross violation of a basic human right.  gt;She is just one of many, many people across the globe facing terrible consequences for doing the right thing. We can't save all of them. You're right, we can't, but this one is one of ours not some random person. This isn't a case of someone standing in front of the Zimbabwe capitol building protesting with a sign. This is an American citizen utilizing an American based platform while in a foreign country, and we as a country should be outraged and demanding her immediate release.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's gotten even worse than that. Voters stopped voting for people ages ago in favor of voting for party, now they've stopped voting for party and are voting for issues. Almost everyone I've ever had an honest conversation with has admitted to boiling their vote down to their stance on any one or any combination of the following issues: 1. Abortion 2. 2nd Amendment 3. Gay marriage/LGBT Rights 4. Death penalty (although that one has lost steam in recent years) 5. Healthcare (this one is overshadowing the death penalty) 6. Military spending/War 7. Civil Rights 8. Religion 9. Drugs 10. Welfare Nearly everyone holds a position on one or more of those topics that is fundamental to who they are and they are morally prohibited from supporting anyone who does agree with them on that topic. Someone who at their core is fundamentally pro-life could never support a Democrat under any circumstances because even if the individual were pro-life, supporting them means supporting the party and the party is without question pro-choice. They would either not vote, or vote for any pro-life candidate before voting for a pro-choice one. The same can be said of someone who is fundamentally against private gun ownership. They would vote for literal Hitler before voting for any pro-2A candidate or Republican because voting for them goes against who they are as a person. These are the issues dividing our country, not the parties. These are the issues that decide who runs our country. Not their intelligence, qualifications, ulterior motives, worthiness of the position, no. Their stance on these issues gets them elected. I'm willing to bet that almost every American voter who reads this has cast their vote based solely on one of those issues at least once in their life.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>On a completely selfish and uncaring level, yes. Personally I feel that single issue voters should abstain from voting because their involvement is damaging and destructive to the election process specifically and society as a whole in general. Single issue voters will cast their vote for whoever shares their stance on that issue, even if that person does not have their best interest at heart, even if they disagree with everything else they believe, or is wholly undeserving or unfit for office. Single issue voters will overlook and forgive the sins of those who support their issue no matter how grievous. I've talked to people who have flat out said that they hate almost everything the Republicans do and stand for, but they're pro-life so they can't vote Democrat. Their involvement in the process causes more problems for them than abstaining, but they won't abstain because of their single issue. What's worse is that the majority of these issues aren't likely to drastically change anytime in the foreseeable future, if ever. Single issue voters in large numbers allow the most charismatic candidate to win instead of the most deserving and they should just stay home because they are damaging the country.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;UBI is socialism, which is basically communism, so I am very much against it. Why would I want some of my tax money back instead of paying less taxes in the first place? You have no idea what socialism is. Socialism is the public ownership and control of the means of production. UBI has nothing to do with the ownership or control of the means of production so it is not any more socialist than social security, Medicare, or any other government funded entity. As long as the ownership and control of the means of production are privately held we will be operating under a capitalist system no matter what anyone does. Stop being scared of words you don't understand and start researching them on your own so you understand them and they aren't so scary.  gt;Communism as an ideology has been directly responsible for the deaths of over 100 million people in the last century alone. Communism is the governmental ownership and control of the means of production and has less than nothing to do with the subject of conversation.  gt;Furthermore you're thinking too narrowly about the wealthy. There's a disturbing trend that assumes all wealthy people are evil and/or don't deserve their money. Especially for people who inherit money. The narrow minded calling the narrow minded narrow minded. God bless Reddit! You're thinking too narrowly about the poor. There's a disturbing trend that assumes all poor people are lazy and/or don't deserve help. Especially for people on welfare.  gt;IMO if you work hard and earn a fortune you deserve it, and if you decide to give that money to your kids then it's theirs and they deserve it. IMO if you work hard and earn a fortune you deserve it, and if you decide to give that money to your kids then you should give it to them while you are alive and can watch them enjoy it. Dead people don't need money and can't make decisions...  gt;If you start taxing everyone to death then the rich will flee the country because they can afford to, the middle class will slowly become poor, and the poor will stay poor. If you don't tax anyone anything the rich will still flee the country because they can afford to, the middle class will quickly become poor, and the poor will stay poor.  gt;Soon you'll end up with nothing but poor people. That's the end goal of capitalism, a handful of people with everything and a whole lot of people with nothing. Haven't you played Monopoly? That's the entire point of the game.  gt;If there are people on welfare who would prefer to have a job and pay taxes but can't due to circumstances beyond their control, then the loss of their vote is a necessary evil that is far outweighed by the majority of welfare voters who vote for more welfare and higher taxes. Jesus you've got a warped sense of civic duty...</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Edit: what people fail to understand is that welfare isn't supposed to be a lifestyle. It's a safety net meant to help people out of extreme circumstances, we shouldn't have multi generation welfare recipients. We shouldn't have people who have more kids just so they get more welfare money. People who end up on welfare should be focused on getting off welfare above all else. Now I know without question that you don't have a single clue what the fuck you're talking about and are regurgitating the talking points fed to you from your news source of choice without ever questioning or researching them on your own. You don't want to think for yourself, you want to be told what to believe. Let's list all the things you're wrong about here 1. Welfare isn't a lifestyle, but the restrictions put on the system by people attempting to curb fraud have created a trap that is nearly impossible to escape. It's not a lifestyle, it's a prison with little chance of parole. 2. TANF (which replaced AFDC as the "cash handout" welfare) requires recipients to actively look for and obtain full time employment within 2 years while also "working" at least 30 hours/week in their job training programs until they do. It also has a 5 year lifetime cap per individual. Single parents who receive child support lose every penny in exchange for welfare...even if the child support is greater than the amount they receive in welfare. In order to collect $250/month in welfare my wife would've had to forfeit $300/mo in child support. That's helping the poor isn't it? 3. It's been over 20 years since welfare recipients received an increase in benefits for new children, but even when they did that increase was a whopping $90/month. Hardly a great incentive to have a child that would cost exponentially more than that. 4. People who are on welfare have only one main concern. Getting the fuck off welfare so ignorant fucks like you will stop judging them for things largely beyond their control. That about covers it. 4 sentences, all filled with bullshit and lies. The welfare queen you hate has never existed, she was invented by Ronald Regan to brainwash you...and it worked beautifully.</TEXT>

Single issue voters absolutely have the right to vote and I would never support anything that took that right away from anyone. In fact, I am opposed to felons losing their right to vote...especially after having served their time and been released. I was just explaining my personal feeling that single issue voters cause more harm to society and the process than good and they would be better served by abstaining. Someone who is staunchly pro-life but liberal in every other facet will cast their vote for a pro-life conservative before they would a pro-choice liberal. Someone who is staunchly conservative but pro-gun control would back a liberal before a conservative. They cast these votes in this manner even though their issues aren't at the forefront of the candidates platform. The result is pro-life liberals being governed by Republicans who they disagree with, and pro-choice conservatives being governed by Democrats who they disagree with. I want to be clear that I'm specifically addressed no bullshit true single issue voters, not people who allow several different issues to guide their vote.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Sorry to come late to the party here.  gt;  gt;"Sympathy to the respective side" means you should try to make the argument that people holding that view would make (if it is their best argument) or otherwise the most persuasive argument. The only rational defenses or justifications for privately owned fire departments revolve entirely around the benefit they give to the business owner. Those are the only arguments that I can come up with that someone in favor of them would make.  gt;When you say:  gt;  gt; gt;There is a reason we transitioned away from privately owned fire departments.  gt;  gt;it undercuts a reader's belief that you are making the best arguments for private service. That may be true, but the statement is historically accurate. I know that it goes against the spirit of this sub, but the reality of things is that not everything can be rationally defended from both sides, and attempting to do so ignores reality and damages society. There are things that work best when profit is the biggest motivating factor, and there are things that work best when they're done by the lowest bidder, but neither of those apply to fire suppression.  gt; When I read your version of the side "for" private service, I literally do not see any arguments in favor of it (not even that it makes money for the business owner). You just give a description. That's because there literally aren't any rational arguments in favor of them, unless you're able to prove me wrong with your own answer and change my view.  gt;Do you think there are any arguments for why someone *other than the owner of the service* would see private fire-fighting service as a positive thing? If so, you should make those arguments. Absolutely none, that's why they don't exist outside of fire brigades charged with protecting a single location.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm not trying to argue, and as a mod you make and enforce the rules, but I put in a good faith effort at answering the question asked. If my response was inappropriate, delete it, that's your job. The fact that the only other top level comment on this question does an even poorer job than I did at attempting to give the "in favor" argument is telling. I am sure that you have had many interesting conversations on many different topics in the past, but this isn't one of them because there literally is no argument that can be made in favor of privately owned fire departments by anyone but the owner of a privately owned fire department. On top of that, the question asked by OP was "should they be privately owned or government funded" and the answer is absolutely and without question "government funded" period, end of statement and my initial response detailed exactly why.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;For privately owned:  gt;  gt;* Taxes likely wouldn't be collected, so the average tax payer would get a tax cut.  gt;  gt;* Private businesses are generally more efficient than anything done by committee. This may lead to lower costs and better response times. (See below)  gt;  gt;* They could invest in new technology faster than public services generally do. Government is not known for innovation or speed. None of those are true. 1. What a tax payer pays would likely increase in the end. Their tax bill would not be reduced, because that's not how taxes work, and the money previously spent on fire would just be redirected to another source while the tax payer received a new bill for private fire protection. So now they're paying taxes plus fire protection. 2. Almost every technological advancement we've seen over the last century has been either directly or indirectly due to government involvement. The only people who can say that the private sector is more efficient than government ignore the fact that the government's buying power alone makes this statement unrealistic and impossible. 3. Again, from weapons, emergency response, transportation, communications, logistics, and just about every other industry, the buying power of the government ensures that the government will usually be the first entity to get their hands on new tech...usually because they funded the R amp;D and covered production costs. Private industry didn't create most of the things that people use everyday (GPS, wireless communication, the internet, etc), the government did. The government has instituted and spearheaded almost every innovation humanity has ever seen so to say they're slow to invest in new tech is ignorant.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;There are a lot of contentions here that I thought needed to be addressed.  gt;  gt;1- That's a cynical view on taxation- we've seen examples of government tax breaks before, so you can't say that a possible benefit of this policy is negated just because you assume how tax funds are used. The theoretical assumption that government will waste as much taxpayer money as possible doesn't affect this discussions because it is at best theoretical, and at worst it's just a lie. It's not cynical, it's realistic. There is a [long history](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/tax/10/temporary-taxes-that-stuck.asp) of taxes remaining in effect long after the projects they were supposed to fund were completed. We have seen tax breaks in the past but most of them were based on voter demand not government savings, almost all of them were unfunded and required us to borrow more to fill the deficit they created (or allow subways to rot, VA hospitals to operate poorly, and government websites to be built poorly), and almost none of them were completely voluntary on the government's part.  gt;2- Technologically, we're looking at private juggernauts of industry like Google or Apple inventing new products all the time- or take for example the new and growing space exploration industry that is privately owned and funded- spacex, virgin galactic, and blue origin, among others. [Some statistics](https://www.keionline.org/22029/) indicate that government interaction in innovation is less that robust, and [this study](http://www.nature.com/news/technology-transfer-industry-funded-academic-inventions-boost-innovation-1.14874) sheds more light on private funded research and its benefits over government-funded work. Everything you just listed is built off the backs of technologies that wouldn't exist without government involvement</TEXT>

Last week my son had an electrical mishap that required me to replace an extension cord and the plug on an appliance. I never did a single internet search on the subject, paid for the 2 items with my debit card, and the next day got an email from Alibaba advertising their deals on extension cords. Could it have been a complete coincidence? Sure, but it's far from the 1st or only example of similar things happening to me. Could I be making it all up? Sure, but I don't know what I would have to gain from doing so. Could there be some other logical explanation besides "they're listening"? Sure, but I haven't heard one yet... Even if an actual person isn't listening, something is, and it's using our words to send us targeted ads. If you've got a better explanation I'm all ears...kinda like our devices ;) If I had tried to tell you in 2005 that the NSA was spying on us you would have had a similar response and called me a paranoid lunatic, and you would have been wrong.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Is it time to update our education model and extend high school 2 years?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-11-22 12:01:49</DATE>
    <TEXT>A comment I left on a Facebook post inspired me to stop commenting and actually do something. It's not huge, but I just sent the following email to my Senator Kamala Harris and I would be interested in discussing it. Dear Senator Harris, I know that you are a busy person so I'll be as brief as I can. During my 10 years of Navy service it was drilled into my head that "because that's the way we've always done it" is the worst reason to keep doing it that way so if you have a better way of doing something then speak up. I have some thoughts on ways we might repair our broken, expensive, and outdated education model and I wanted to share them with you. I have never directly contacted one of my elected representatives before and I appreciate you taking the time to hear me out. If there is someone who would be more appropriate to share these thoughts with I welcome your suggestions. A high school diploma is no longer the minimum level of education required to be employable in this country much beyond minimum wage. At the same time, under most circumstances a Bachelor's Degree is more than should be required to get your foot in the door in most fields. What if high school were to be extended two years to a K-14 system? Elementary school would be K-5, middle school 6-10, and high school 11-14. Students could take an aptitude test similar to the ASVAB in 10th grade and use those scores to help guide them into high school. The current 2 year, trade school, and community college systems (and college atmospheres) would be dissolved and absorbed and become high school, grades 11-14. Upon graduation at age 20-21 they would possess an Associates Degree or Trade Certification in the field of their choosing and be employable in any entry level position anywhere in the country, and most places outside. I would also like to see this level of education be compulsory before being eligible for military service as well. The list of reasons why 18 year old children shouldn't be serving in the military is nearly infinite, but that's for another discussion. This model would dramatically reduce the demand for higher education which would reduce costs and prices and the debt currently associated with it because the only people seeking it would be those genuinely pursuing higher learning and those pursuing specialized fields that actually require it. I believe this would save money while also satisfying the "free college" push that's gaining traction. I believe it would also be looked upon favorably by conservatives who value choice in education as it allows each individual the choice to choose the future that is right for them. I believe it would increase the general knowledge base of the population which would benefit the country as a whole and serve society better than our current model. This would help the middle class and especially the poor and would allow for more upward mobility and success stories than our current model. This could even potentially have a dramatic effect on underage drinking and drug use, especially related to college. Our Constitution does not guarantee every person equal success, only equal opportunity, and I believe this model would provide exactly that. Equal opportunity to every person to be whatever they want to be and as successful as they want to be in the greatest country in the world. I would enjoy hearing your thoughts on my ideas. Thank you for your time and for your service. Very Respectfully, /u/subject807</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Speaking from a former law enforcement officer's perspective, the absolute best thing you can do in any situation is be a good witness. It doesn't require any training, it doesn't require you to get personally involved in the situation, it doesn't require you to put yourself in danger in any way. Just pay attention to what you see, and remember as much as you can. In any emergency situation someone needs to call for help, you don't have to be that person because talking to the operator will distract you from your duties as a witness, but you can ensure someone does. Point to someone, anyone, and tell them to call 911 (or equivalent). If they don't, pick someone else and keep going until you see someone make the call. Above all else protect yourself, do your best to remain calm, be a good witness, and then report what you saw.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Neither Facebook nor Twitter sell me anything. I sell them my personal information to gain access to their platform, well not Twitter because I don't have an account but you get the point. ISP's bought hardware in order to sell access to the internet and I pay a handsome monthly fee for access to that hardware. Why should they then get to sell my personal information for free (I get nothing from that transaction) on top of limiting how much of the internet I have access to (changing the terms of our agreement without my input or consent)? Because they have the money to buy the legislation that allows it? Fuck that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;OK, so what benefit do you have for not supporting neutrality for major media sites, like facebook or twitter? I mean there is nothing stopping them from banning you, and many people already have been banned. First off, I never said I don't support neutrality for major media sites, those were your words. My relationship with Facebook is symbiotic. I sell them pieces of "me" in exchange for access to Facebook and all that it has to offer. At any point either one of us are free to sever that relationship for pretty much any reason either of us want. If I decide that I no longer wish to participate in the exchange, I can cancel my account at any time. I would like to see a regulation put in place that ensures if I choose to do that, all my information that had been stored is destroyed and no longer used in the future, but as things stand I accept that in the event I cancel my account, Facebook would still likely retain some of my personal information for financial gain of some sort. Conversely, if Facebook decides to ban me from the site for violating the T amp;C I agreed to when creating my account, they are free to do so at the cost of losing access to the personal information I am providing. It's not like I can force them to accept it as payment for access because it's not legal tender and it's a private forum which is the difference between this situation and the gay wedding cake case. For the last 3 years I've been paying $129/mo to my ISP (a small startup) for 400 GB of internet access at speeds "up to" 10 Mbps download and "up to" 3 Mbps upload (in reality 3-5 Mbps down and .1-.8 Mbps up) in a house with 2 adults and 4 teenagers. You're trying to tell me that it's in my best interest to allow my ISP to charge me even more than they currently do while providing me less than they currently do, and I'm telling you to get fucked because there isn't anything that you could possibly say that would convince me to support this very obvious gluttonous money grab.  gt;like how you don't have to buy every channel when you buy cable, Have you ever bought cable?!?! I haven't given a cable or satellite company a dime of my hard earned money for over 8 years because I was tired of their bullshit. I watch about 20 channels, but in order to get those channels I have to buy anywhere from 50 to 1,000 other channels that I never intended to watch. You actually *want* that kind of model for internet access? Like for real, you think that would benefit the consumer *more* than paying a flat fee for complete access to everything? How much do you stand to profit from the repeal of net neutrality? That's the only possible reason for supporting it.</TEXT>

None of those communication companies are capable of violating the 1st Amendment and their blocking of pro-choice websites would only violate free speech if they did so on behalf of or were coerced into doing so by the government. It would be censorship, but not a constitutional violation.

    <TEXT>As if any ISP would sell Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, and Google access in the same package. That's cute. Everyone with a lick of common sense knows they'd have to buy a Facebook package that came with access to a bunch of other sites that they don't want. Want Twitter? That's another package full of shit sites you don't want. YouTube would be in yet another package deal. It would be just like cable, advertising one price but by the time you get access to the content you want your bill is now 3-5x higher. No thanks, that's why I haven't given a dime to a cable or satellite company for almost a decade. When they change their business model and allow me to purchase only the content I want at a price that I feel is reasonable I'll consider coming back, until then I'll keep torrenting and stealing the content I'd otherwise be more than willing to pay for. That's capitalism.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;right now ISPs have to let nazis post on their nazi websites. Why shouldn't they have to? The nazi's are paying their ISP for access to the internet not access to their nazi website. They pay someone else for the server space to host their nazi website and for the bandwidth used by visitors to the site. ISPs are not, and should not be, required to allow nazis to post on the ISPs website, and ISPs are not, and should not be, allowed to prevent those nazis from visiting and posting to a site that has no affiliation what so ever with the ISP. If the site host is OK with the [legal] content of a site, the ISP should have no say in whether or not someone can visit it. If I open my private property for public use and charge money for people to drive through it, I should not be able to charge some more than others based on their destination (because the distance across my property is static and the destination has no effect on my costs to maintain the path) but I should be able to charge heavier vehicles more than lighter ones because regardless of their destination they *do* have an effect on my costs to maintain the path (data limits are fine, destination limits are not), nor should I be able to allow some to pass while denying others based on their political, religious, or other views. If I want to be selective about who I allow to pass through and who I don't, I would have to operate as a private shortcut and not open to the public.</TEXT>

It simply prevents them from doing so on Reddit or Twitter. If enough people demand it, another company who will not censor those views will create a platform for people to share them, that's how capitalism works.

With the exception of their retirement accounts (which is Congress' fault) I can't think of a single entity on the planet that operates as smoothly and efficiently as the USPS. I like having the ability to send a letter from one coast to the other in as little as 3 and at most 5 days for a cost of less than $0.75, and in over 40 years they've never lost a single item I've sent or was sent to me and they have always been up front when things got damaged in route and reimbursed me for said damage. What's your beef with the USPS based on? Last thing I want is internet pricing the likes of cable and satellite television. Which is a better deal for consumers? Paying a flat fee for access to the entire internet at a predetermined speed and [possibly] a predetermined data limit, or paying a flat fee for access to whichever portions of the internet your ISP wishes to give you with additional costs for different packages of specific websites and variable speeds and data limits depending on the site you're using?</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Then you must not have put a lot of thought into it. The USPS is incredibly inefficient and the exact opposite of smooth. They regularly mark packages as "attempted to deliver" without leaving their car to deliver them and they often misrepresent the delivery status of packages. They are also losing an immense amount of money $2.8 Billion a year. This is why FedEx and UPS are thriving. It doesn't sound like you have issues with the USPS, it sounds like you have issues with individual employees of the USPS which is true of any business employing human beings. In my personal experience, both FedEx and UPS are far more guilty of marking packages as delivered when they in fact weren't and for the last 3 years FedEx won't even drive down my road if it's rained in the last 48 hours, but the post office will (neither rain nor sleet nor hail will stop the US mail...) The reason that the USPS is losing that amount of money is because they are the only entity that I'm aware of that is Congressionally required to fully fund their pension program, hence my "it's congress' fault" comment. A large part of the reason that FedEx and UPS are doing so well is because they charge and are paid a fee to deliver a package to a residence or business and instead of doing that they drop it at the local post office who then delivers it without compensation. Do you enjoy private businesses using your tax dollars to increase their profits? I don't.  gt; gt;What's your beef with the USPS based on?  gt;FedEx can overnight a 10lb package to my house cheaper than USPS can get it to me in 3-5 business days. That's because they've invested more money into logistics, have fewer regulations they have to follow, AND specialize in packages. It's not cause they're better, it's cause they're richer. You may be able to ship a package cheaper through a private business because that's their specialty, but I dare you to try to send a letter anywhere in the world cheaper than you can at the USPS because that's their specialty.  gt;The USPS is a perfect example of why government monopolies stagnate growth. USPS has no reason to improve, they have no reason to get you your package. What are you going to do, call and complain? Take your business elsewhere? Well they'll get their money regardless because it's government funded. You just spent your entire comment detailing why you think their competition is better than they are and then closed your comment by claiming that they have no competition.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; I literally spelled out that the "they're not the government so it's ok" angle was what concerned me. And I literally spelled out why your belief is false and free speech is not being violated. If I invite someone into my house and they start saying things that I fundamentally disagree with and don't want to hear, I am not violating their free speech by asking or forcing them to leave. That is the exact same thing as social media. Their platform is their home and they invite people into it to socialize and they are well within their rights, as owners of the home, to dictate what can and can't be said there. This isn't a free speech issue, it's a property rights issue. You do not have the right to go onto a message board, into a home, or into a business owned by someone else and say whatever you want, that's not what free speech is about.  gt;Free Speech is the concept itself that no one should be silenced for their beliefs, by anyone. Wrong, free speech is the concept itself that no one should be persecuted or prosecuted for their beliefs, it has nothing to do with silencing. Should employers be required to allow their employees to discuss unionization while at work and on the clock? Does preventing that violate the employee's free speech? Or does forcing the employer to allow it violate their property rights more? I lean toward the latter over the former. Now if the employer is trying to prohibit employees from discussing that while off the clock and off the premises, *then* we've got a free speech issue.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I worked as a CNA in a nursing home for a year when I was 17. I only worked there for a year because I was raised to respect my elders and I couldn't handle the fact that as a 17 year old punk kid I was telling these members of "the Greatest Generation" when to wake up, what to wear, when and what to eat, when to go to the bathroom, or when to go to bed and I finally cracked. This was in western CO in the mid-90s and the home I worked in had two wings, a "Medicare Wing" where patients/residents recovered from surgeries before going home or received long term care when they were mostly self-sufficient but still unable to live on their own, and there was an "Alzheimer's Wing" for residents suffering from that and other horrible dehumanizing conditions like dementia. I worked the Medicare wing and my mother worked the Alzheimer's wing as a nurse but occasionally I would fill in on that side as well even though I hated how much it made me face my own mortality and recognize exactly how fragile us humans really are. Very few of the residents of either wing ever had regular visits from their family and we did our best to fill that void as best we could, but it was never really enough and the morale of the residents clearly displayed how miserable some of them were with their situation of just sitting in a home waiting to die. Although not a typical nursing home resident there was one individual that had a profound impact on my life and I have never forgotten anything about him...except his name unfortunately. Toward the end of my time there a 27 year old man checked himself into the home for hospice care after his HIV had developed into full blown AIDS and it was the first time I had ever met anyone with this disease that I had heard so much about. When he arrived he looked like a normal everyday 27 year old man but within a few days his skin started to show the kind of sores common with that disease. A week later he couldn't walk, a week after that he couldn't talk, and the following week he died peacefully surrounded by his family and friends. All in all he spent 27 days in the home before passing away. Another resident that left a big impression on me was a retired doctor who never came out of his room. All of the rooms on both wings were double occupancy with two beds and Dr. Fox was the only person in the building in a room by himself. Years before I started working there his wife had occupied the second bed and when she passed away he continued to pay for her side to avoid having a roommate. He was a horribly grumpy person who did not like being bothered, never got a single visitor that I know of the entire time I worked there, and although he had no mobility problems he took all of his meals in his room alone. The only time I interacted with him was when I delivered his meal and collected his tray when he was through, and delivered his clean bedding and collected the dirty set (he made his own bed). Looking back on it I wished that I had been able to overcome my fear of him and try to connect because in hindsight it was very clear that he was horribly depressed and couldn't wait for his life to be over. Over time I came to hate that place and the family members who dumped their loved ones off and forgot about them, and I couldn't imagine a more lonely and miserable existence than living in a nursing home. I can't count the number of times that either I or my mother would come home completely wrecked after sitting watch and holding the hand of another person as their body lost the battle with whatever disease had been attacking them and there were many nights where we would console each other as we cried ourselves to sleep. I vowed then that I would never allow either one of my parents to ever live that kind of life and I hoped that when my time came that I wouldn't be shipped off to such a horrible place myself. I am now 40, my mothers is 63 and newly engaged to who will become husband #5 (her husband of 20 years passed away a year ago from cancer) and my father is 72 and still lives alone a few miles from my younger brother, my oldest child is 21, and my views on nursing homes has changed dramatically from when I was 17. As miserable as life can be in a nursing home, I can't imagine anything more terrifying or lonely than a human being dying alone with nobody to watch over them as their life slips away. Please, I beg of you, if it is within your power please do not allow another human being to suffer like that alone.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'd love to hear you explain how a Senator could commit the crimes discovered during the audit. According to the audit, the state:  gt;Improperly included in its billings more than $400 million owed to the school employees' pension fund "despite not having made scheduled payments to the fund in nearly 20 years;"  gt;Incorrectly added the payroll costs of school employees who provided administrative rather than medical care;  gt;Did not submit records demonstrating how much time medical employees spent providing services. Stop deflecting and discuss the actual topic. If you'd like to discuss the Democrat standing trial for a crime he (not his party) committed, start a thread and send me the link and I'd be happy to join you there. As it stands, bringing that subject up gives the appearance that you're perfectly Ok with Republicans breaking whatever laws they want because a Democrat was investigated, charged, and is being tried for a crime.</TEXT>

If I were in the business of selling wedding cakes, and I was charging wedding cake prices for standard grocery store sheet cakes, I'm fairly certain that anyone whose been to wedding would agree that what I am providing does not meet the standard for a "wedding cake".

    <TEXT>You are correct, a couple could very easily choose to use a Carvel ice cream cake as their wedding cake, and they would be smart to do so considering the cost of wedding cakes these days. The owner of a business that's open to the public that sells wedding cakes shouldn't be able to make that choice for them though. You either sell wedding cakes or you don't, and you're either open to the public or you're not. If you're open to the public and you sell wedding cakes, the type of wedding should be irrelevant to your decision about whether or not to sell a cake...but the "type" of cake is at your discretion. In other words, if someone wants a standard wedding cake, you sell the damn cake cause that's what you opened your business to provide, but if someone wants a custom cake with an offensive theme you don't have to provide one. A gas station owner shouldn't be allowed to refuse to sell gas to someone based on their destination, and a cake maker shouldn't be allowed to refuse to make a cake based on its destination.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's not arbitrary, it's necessary. Individual cases set the [legal precedent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precedent) that all future cases will be judged against. It is absolutely necessary to look at the worst case scenario of every case capable of setting precedent, because that's how that worst case scenario will be decided should it ever occur. If I were the owner a gas station, should I be allowed to refuse to sell gas to customers if I disagreed with the destination they'll use my gas to get to? If a customer came in and I saw a cross around their neck, should I be allowed to refuse them service if I am fundamentally opposed to organized religion and by selling them gas I'm approving of them using that gas to get to church? Of course not. Not only because Christianity is a protected class, but also because as a business owner I have no say in what my products are used for once the business transaction has been completed. If I ran a YouTube channel dedicated to destroying the newest and greatest tech devices on their release dates, should tech companies be allowed to refuse to sell their devices to me because they don't like that I destroy them?</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; I'm confused, isn't it the right of a business owner to refuse service to someone for any reason except for reasons having to do with protected classes? It's the right of a business owner to hang up a sign that says "We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone". How legally enforceable that declaration is varies by circumstance and changes over time. Once upon a time it was legal to refuse service to blacks, now it's not. The world isn't black and white and neither is our bloated and convoluted legal code, there's various shades of gray in both.  gt;I know that legal precedant is important, but a decision in favor of the baker could still set a precedent that prevents the worst case scenario, if the particulars of this case set it apart. This is very true, that's what happened in the [Hobby Lobby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burwell_v._Hobby_Lobby_Stores,_Inc.) case. The decision handed down by the Justices can only be applied under very narrow circumstances, in that case it only applies to *closely held* corporations because controlling interest in Hobby Lobby had always been held by a small number of family members. That's very rare though and most decisions like this have broad sweeping effects. Think Citizens United, Roe v Wade, Brown v Board of Ed, etc.  gt;It's a totally dumb policy, but if there was evidence for such a policy, would it make a difference constitutionally? Or does the ultimate recipient of the cake - who at a gay wedding is inevitably a gay person - still count as the customer regardless of who buys it? You gave a good example, but the crux of the argument really comes down to "When does a business owner lose a controlling interest in their product?" Essentially what happened was this. The bakery offers a variety of stock wedding cake designs, and couples can either purchase them as is, or pay extra for customization. I believe that the bakery has the right to refuse customization on orders for basically any reason they want. They shouldn't be forced to make a cake celebrating the KKK, LGBT issues, Nazi's or any other theme they find morally offensive, but if a customer comes in and orders the stock cake without any customization they have to sell the cake. If an auto body shop offers stock and custom paint jobs, they can decline a custom job for pretty much any reason they want, but they have to sell the stock job regardless of how they feel about the customer. If a photographer offers "head shot" type services and custom portraits, they can decline custom sets but they have to provide the stock "head shot" to anyone who can pay. That's the deal when you're open to the public in my opinion. You can agree to it or you can open a private business or club and be selective about your clients but lose access to the majority of your potential customer base.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's not double edged and it's not tricky. It's actually pretty simple.  gt; If you truly believe that your religion does not allow you to do something... then your religious beliefs do not allow you to own a business open to the public that may require you to do the thing your beliefs forbid. You do not have an inherent right to own a business, and if your personal, moral, or religious beliefs prohibit you from serving select members of society they prohibit you from owning a business open to all of society. If you want to be selective about your clientele, or only serve those people whose beliefs mirror yours, you can open a private business or club but if you want to be open to the public, you're open to the whole public. That's the deal. Specifically discussing the cake case, the baker is well within his rights to refuse to customize a cake celebrating a gay wedding but refusing to sell any cake at all crosses a line. An atheist gas station owner can't refuse to sell gas to a Christian because they'll use it to go to church, and a Christian baker can't refuse to sell a generic wedding cake to a gay couple because they'll be eating it at a gay wedding. The purchaser of an item gets to decide what that item gets used for, the seller loses all rights to control that product when the business transaction is complete.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; As far as the disassociation goes, should someone who was once a Christian but now a Muslim be forced to sell bacon at their store because they weren't always a Muslim? That's not what's going on here. The baker isn't being asked to provide something that their religion forbids. The baker is being asked to provide something that the baker already provides to everyone...except gay people. If you own a business that sells wedding cakes among other things, you are well within your rights to refuse to create a wedding cake depicting two guys humping if you find that subject matter distasteful, but you do not have the right to refuse to make a generic wedding cake because you don't approve of the couple getting married. You aren't being asked to approve of the ceremony, you're being asked to provide the service you hung up a shingle outside advertising that you provide. If you no longer wish to provide that service, close and allow another entrepreneur to replace you. That's capitalism.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Let's look at 3 different businesses that offer similar services where artistic expression is involved. * An body shop that offers "stock" and custom paint jobs for automobiles. * A photographer who offers stock "head shot" prints and custom portrait sets. * A bakery that offers stock wedding cakes designs that can be customized by the client for an additional cost. All three of these businesses offer a stock service and a customization services that allows them to use their artistic talents to create something unique for the purchaser. All three of these businesses can refuse custom work for pretty much any reason they want. A baker shouldn't be forced to use their artistic talents to create a cake depicting the lynching of a black person to celebrate the KKK, but they have to provide their stock product to anyone who wants it and is willing to pay. An auto body shop should not be forced to create a custom paint job depicting the remains of aborted fetuses for a Pro-Life customer, but they have to sell the stock paint job to anyone who wants it and is willing to pay. A photographer should not be forced to photograph a couple's sexual liaison if they don't want to, but they have to sell the "head shot" service to anyone who comes in and is willing to pay. That's the deal when you're open to the public, it means you're open to the public... If your personal, moral, religious, or other beliefs prevent, prohibit, or forbid you from carrying out the duties of your business to all members of society, those beliefs prohibit you from operating a business open to the public. If you want to be selective about your customers, make your business private. It'll cost you access to the majority of your customer base, but your conscience will be clean and you won't get sued.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There are a lot of different angles to this issue that need to be looked at. In reality, what the wedding cake case comes down to is "When does a business lose a controlling interest in the fate of the products they sell?" If I ran a website dedicated to destroying the latest piece of tech gear, newest console, newest phone, etc. on the day that they were released, should tech companies be allowed to refuse to sell me their product because they don't like what I do with them? I don't believe that they should, just as I don't believe that a baker should have a say in where their products are served or who eats them. The baker shouldn't be forced to create a customized "gay cake", but they should be forced to create a "Plain Jane" wedding cake if that's the service they're selling even if that cake's entire purpose is to feed hogs, sit on the street and rot, or celebrate a gay wedding. The maker has no say in the final use of their product under most circumstances and allowing them that power strips my right of ownership from me. If you're worried about rights, the rights of the individual trump the rights of a business every single day and twice on Sunday. A person has the right to exist, a business does not. Another thing to keep in mind is that the government isn't some monolithic entity doing its own thing (even though it can sometimes look and feel like it is), it is simply an extension of The People. The government isn't forcing anyone to do anything through regulations, The People are using the government (the only tool at their disposal) to implement their will. The government isn't suing the baker in order to force them to do anything, The People are suing the baker to force them to act within the social boundaries that The People have set via the government...and as society changes, so do those boundaries. A business owner has the right to hang up a sign that says "We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone", how enforceable that declaration is depends on the circumstances and changes over time. As an example, once upon a time it was legal for a business to refuse service to blacks, now it's not.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's not entirely accurate. The medal is normally awarded by the President of the United States in the name of the U.S. Congress. The Medal of Honor was created as a Navy version in 1861 named the "Medal of Valor", and an Army version of the medal named the "Medal of Honor" was established in 1862 to give recognition to men who distinguished themselves "conspicuously by gallantry and intrepidity" in combat with an enemy of the United States. Because the medal is presented "in the name of Congress", it is often referred to as the "Congressional Medal of Honor". However, the official name is "Medal of Honor". There are two distinct protocols for awarding the Medal of Honor. The first and most common is nomination and approval through the chain of command of the service member. The second method is nomination by a member of the U.S. Congress, generally at the request of a constituent. In both cases, if the proposal is outside the time limits for the recommendation, approval to waive the time limit requires a special Act of Congress. The Medal of Honor is presented by the President on behalf of, and in the name of, the Congress.</TEXT>

Colin Powell. From the MoF wiki linked earlier:  gt;President John F. Kennedy established the current decoration in 1963 through Executive Order 11085, with unique and distinctive insignia, vastly expanded purpose, and far higher prestige. It was the first U.S. civilian neck decoration and, in the grade of Awarded With Distinction, is the only U.S. sash and star decoration (the Chief Commander degree of the Legion of Merit  #8211; which may only be awarded to foreign heads of state  #8211; is a star decoration, but without a sash). So Obama awarded Biden the Medal of Freedom With Distinction. It's the same award, but like you mentioned it's kind of a second tier.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For what it's worth, I haven't downvoted you and I disagree with those who have. As for her award, the write-up on [this page](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/campaign/medal-of-freedom) says:  gt;Ellen DeGeneres is an award-winning comedian who has hosted her popular daytime talk show, The Ellen DeGeneres Show, since 2003 with her trademarked humor, humility, and optimism. In 2003 Ellen lent her voice to a forgetful but unforgettable little fish named Dory in Finding Nemo. She reprised her role again in 2016 with the hugely successful Finding Dory. Ellen also hosted the Academy Awards twice, in 2007 and 2014. In 1997, after coming out herself, DeGeneres made TV history when her character on Ellen revealed she was a lesbian. In her work and in her life, she has been a passionate advocate for equality and fairness. I'm not sure how old you were, but when she came out in 1997 both as a character on TV and as a person in real life it was a really *really* big deal. As other people have accurately stated, she risked a lot making the choice to come out so openly and that choice and move sort of forced a public discussion about all things LGBT...I mean the acronym LGBT didn't even exist back then, at least not in the mainstream lexicon. Through her subsequent talk show she's been a voice not only for that community, but for everyone. She's very active charitably and aside from the benefits she's brought to the LGBT community she does a pretty outstanding job of demonstrating the kind of healthy giving attitude that sort of defines America. Whether you support her sexuality or not she's a pretty awesome person who I feel deserves that kind of recognition and I don't think her inclusion is out of place compared to the rest of the people that Obama honored with the award during his tenure.</TEXT>

While everyone here knows what's being discussed, the users of Reddit subscribe to a variety of different subreddits and they all show up intermingled in their feed. When scrolling through Reddit the vast majority of people do not think "chronic pain" when they see CP because to the entire world CP means one thing and one thing only. If you want your post to be visible I wouldn't use it because I'm sure quite a few people use those two letters together as a filter for good reason. My wife has been suffering from CRPS for 10 years and I'm intimately familiar with how bad chronic pain sucks and I'm just trying to help, your attitude was unnecessary and uncalled for.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Isn't all this affecting you? Tax bill, health insurance, net neutrality, rigged elections.... None of those things negatively impact the average person's day to day life. Taxes are viewed as a certainty, and the amount of tax is never going to cause a revolt here. Health insurance is still viewed as a luxury to most and almost nobody gets physically turned away from life saving care, at least not enough to really matter. The internet is viewed in much the same way and most consider it a luxury because most of the people in charge lived most of their lives without it and don't view it as a necessity. Rigged elections are above the pay grade of the average person so they aren't going to sacrifice their comfort for something they have no hope of changing. The kind of revolution that you're talking about is coming, if not in my lifetime certainly in my children's, but it's still quite a few years away...barring some cataclysmic event that ignites it sooner. Nothing will drastically change as long as people can get their Starbucks on their way to work, stop at a fully stocked grocery store on the way home, and have the lights come on when they flip the switch when they get there. Those are the kind of things that get the average person protesting 24/7.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; But my right to swing my fist ends where someone else nose begins. That's not even remotely true and this mindset is making things worse, not better. You have the right to swing your fist anywhere you want, into whatever body part you want, belonging to any person you want, for any reason you want, as often and as hard as you want. You have that absolute right as a living breathing human being with free will...nobody can stop you but you. You just have to be prepared to accept the responsibility for exercising that right because while you do have the right to swing that fist, you do not have the right to escape the consequences for doing so. Taking an example from current pop culture, you have the absolute right to punch a Nazi in the face if you don't like what they have to say, as long as you're willing to accept the consequences for doing so. That Nazi has the absolute right to say whatever they want, as long as they're willing to accept the consequences for doing so...namely risking getting punched in the face.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Bombing an ISIS stronghold may kill a few potential terrorists, but it only serves to strengthen their standing among fellow believers. It gives ISIS the ability to say "We are so hated for our beliefs that the Americans want to exterminate us and we must fight back or die. We must take the fight to them and attack them in their homes, in their cities, in their country." It is far better to attack their ideals and their rhetoric than it is to bomb them to dust, no matter how satisfying that may be, but bombing them to dust there prevents them from attacking us here...at least until their children reach fighting ages. Violence is very rarely the appropriate response to a situation, but it is quite often very effective even when it's inappropriate. In my opinion, Nazi beliefs are a direct threat to a subset of the American people because if given enough leeway they will absolutely and without question use violence as their main tool to effect the change they want to see and as such anyone who holds those beliefs constitutes a clear and present threat to what it means to be American. There are people and groups who will hang themselves if given enough rope, Nazis on the other hand hang other people with the rope and should not be given that opportunity. There's a point where the best method in self defense is to hit your attacker back first. You do not need to wait to be assaulted before you can defend yourself if you believe an attack on you is imminent and Nazi beliefs constitute an imminent threat to the fabric of America. There is no way for them to implement their beliefs without violence so publicly rallying behind those believe is a public threat against all those they hate...and the people they hate are the people I would give my life defending.</TEXT>

She would be given 10 hours worth of work to do in her 8 hour shift during which she would often be called up to the front to run a check stand. She was required to clock out at the end of her shift (unauthorized overtime was a fireable offense) but she was not allowed to leave until the assigned work was done. When I wrote a letter to corporate explaining that and other illegal things the store was doing she wouldn't let me send it because she needed the job. This was 10 years ago but my daughter is currently working for a national fast food chain where she is subjected to similar illegal practices and she fears reporting it because the phone calls are recorded and played for the manager of the store.

So we lost a couple of battles in the cyber war and a few of our networks were compromised and you think that means we aren't even participating? Do you even know how warfare takes place? 3. You're right, the people responsible for making laws/budgets don't know much about computers, but they are the gold standard when it comes to delegating responsibility. They delegate that responsibility to people who *do* know computers and *do* know that their rules of engagement do not exist. There are no rules in espionage genius.

    <TEXT>I'm discussing drugs available by prescription only that have zero competition because they're brand new and have patent protections prohibiting competition for 20 years and you're countering with over the counter medications. We're having two very different conversations.  gt;The drugs on TV are aimed at insured middle class people. Middle class people don't watch television to the extent that poor people do and the majority of the drug advertising takes place during the day or late at night when most middle class people are at work or sleeping, in magazines that middle class people don't read, on bus stops that middle class people don't use, and in health clinics that middle class people have no use for. Thanks for playing though. Try again.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Not true, this is against the law (at least in U.S.) It's only against the law if you can prove you were fired for discussing it. The reality is that "right to work" laws defacto eliminate the ability to enforce those laws unless the employer is stupid enough to admit the reason you were terminated. When you can be terminated for any reason or no reason at all, any law restricting the reasons you can be terminated are rendered moot.  gt;Salaried workers rate of pay is not typically public knowledge (except in gov. jobs). Really? So you can't go to places like glassdoor and see the salary range for every position and field? Damn, guess I dreamt that. Also, the higher your salary the more likely it is to be public knowledge because they have to be disclosed to shareholders.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm not the OP you're responding to but there is [this article](http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/pope-francis-pressure-confront-sex-abuse-chile-52370847) that just happened to show up on the next page of my feed where Pope Francis begged for forgiveness Tuesday for the "irreparable damage" done to children who were raped and molested by priests.  gt; gt; In his first event of the day, Francis met privately with Chilean President Michelle Bachelet and addressed lawmakers, judges and other authorities at La Moneda palace. They interrupted him with applause when he said he felt "bound to express my pain and shame" that some of Chile's pastors had sexually abused children in their care.  gt;  gt; gt;"I am one with my brother bishops, for it is right to ask forgiveness and make every effort to support the victims, even as we commit ourselves to ensuring that such things do not happen again," he said. Since I'm fairly certain you won't read the article and your immediate response will be something to the effect of "That doesn't mean it was covered up", there's this as well...  gt; gt;Francis didn't refer by name to Chile's most notorious pedophile priest, the Rev. Fernando Karadima, who was sanctioned in 2011 by the Vatican to a lifetime of "penance and prayer" for sexually molesting minors. Nor did he refer to the fact that the emeritus archbishop of Santiago, a top papal adviser, has acknowledged he knew of complaints against Karadima but didn't remove him from ministry. So there's that. Are you seriously questioning whether this has happened before? Do you live under a rock? Or just ignore the things that make you feel icky?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A sports league that gets caught cheating, or a business getting caught doing fucked up shit don't typically hold themselves up as the pillar of morality while doing it. While individual people commit the crimes, the church body as a whole is complicit in their cover-up because even when reports are made, the devout simply deny, deny, deny and bring up strawmen arguments to explain away their sins because "well everyone else does it too". If the devout were only concerned with the sins of the devout it wouldn't be as insulting, but the devout seem to live to call out the sins of others while sweeping their own under the rug never to be spoken of outside of confessional.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; It's a hard pill for some to swallow I'm sure that's what they tell the children right before...  gt;but that doesn't change whether or not they have been forgiven by God. God's forgiveness is irrelevant here on Earth. If it exists at all, it can only be granted after death and from God himself.  gt;there is a difference between forgiveness and justice. You're correct. One is born out of man's law and the other can only come from the victim. Anyone else's forgiveness is irrelevant and only exists to ease the conscience of the guilty at the expense of their victims.  gt;A good criminal can get away with murder while the are alive (The Zodiac comes to mind), but they cannot escape God in death. They can if God doesn't exist. This may be an insurmountable obstacle in this discussion, but there exists the very real possibility that God does not exist. In a world where God does not exist and the words of the Bible are used to "forgive" sinners here on Earth because "God's judgement is eternal", victims go without justice and sinners go without punishment all for the sake of controlling the populace and fleecing their pockets.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>While we may not be able to change each other's views on this subject, not that either of us really have a view that needs changing, I am curious about something. God has already divorced himself from the goings on here on Earth and has given us free will to do as we please in the hopes that we'll choose to follow his teachings in spite of his absence. I'm wondering how the world would be worse if there were no God since we already live a world where his presence doesn't exist? I also want to be clear that I do not have a problem with God or with religious people in general, my problem lies with the institution of organized religion itself. I firmly believe that a truly religious person could not stand by and allow a child to be victimized if they possessed knowledge or evidence of it, their convictions simply would not allow them to do nothing, and the same could be said of any true man of God. Organized religion however has no such convictions and not only turns a blind eye to the victimization of children (among others), it expressly forbids acting on that information when someone possess it with the threat of eternal damnation. The only thing necessary for evil to triumph is for good people to do nothing, and "the church" not only does nothing it forbids other good people from taking action as well. At the same time though, I also believe that any God who would essentially tell his priests "Forgive all sins that are confessed and allow the sinner to continue to sin so long as they continue to confess and I'll deal with them in the afterlife" is wholly unworthy of worship.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; I think you should look up the word "Jihad" and learn a few things. I think you should do the same because I suspect it doesn't mean what you've been indoctrinated to believe it means. How about instead of looking it up though, you go talk to some faithful followers of Islam and get their take on it instead. That's what I did and it was an enlightening experience.  gt;The middle east hated us before we were involved. Proof? I can link to some pictures of the middle east in the 60's and 70's that show that not only did they not hate us back then, they emulated us, dressed like us, listened to our music, and studied our culture.  gt;oh, and North Korea is a fascist dictatorship. That may be true, and that dictatorship may hate us, but you've taken the feelings of a dictator and applied it to an entire country of oppressed people by saying N. Korea hates us when I'd be willing to bet that a large portion of the N.

    <TEXT>Based on its shape and size I'm guessing it's one of the entries for the competition to win the contract to build a new [carrier based airborne refueling drone](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-navy-preps-drone-refueling-121004745.html) for the Navy. There were initially 4 aircraft manufacturers fighting over the contract: Boeing, Lockheed Martin, General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, and Northrop Grumman...but they pulled out of the bidding in late October saying it would not be able to meet the Navy #8217;s contract terms. The Navy is expected to make their decision by September of this year and designs are starting to go public. Boeing recently unveiled [their entry](http://247wallst.com/aerospace-defense/2017/12/19/boeing-lifts-veil-on-unmanned-navy-refueling-tanker/). General Atomics has released some [concept art](https://icdn8.digitaltrends.com/image/general-atomics-325x325.jpg) for its entrant, based on its Sea Avenger program, but Boeing is the first to show off an actual prototype and I can't find anything about Lockheed's entry. Also worth considering are aircraft like [Northrup Grumman's X-47B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northrop_Grumman_X-47B) unmanned demonstrator aircraft.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;really makes you think. It's really a shame to see you've done your own homework and stopped as soon as you found something that fit your view instead of going to the source like I suggested. If you are really interested in thinking, [give this](https://www.juancole.com/2013/04/islamic-forbids-terrorism.html) a read.  gt;here are the top ten ways that Islamic law and tradition forbid terrorism:  gt;  gt;1. Terrorism is above all murder. Murder is strictly forbidden in the Qur #8217;an. Qur #8217;an 6:151 says,  #8220;and do not kill a soul that God has made sacrosanct, save lawfully. #8221; (i.e. murder is forbidden but the death penalty imposed by the state for a crime is permitted). 5:53 says,  #8220; #8230; whoso kills a soul, unless it be for murder or for wreaking corruption in the land, it shall be as if he had killed all mankind; and he who saves a life, it shall be as if he had given life to all mankind. #8221;  gt;  gt;2. If the motive for terrorism is religious, it is impermissible in Islamic law. It is forbidden to attempt to impose Islam on other people. The Qur #8217;an says,  #8220;There is no compulsion in religion. The right way has become distinct from error. #8221; (-The Cow, 2:256). Note that this verse was revealed in Medina in 622 AD or after and was never abrogated by any other verse of the Quran. Islam #8217;s holy book forbids coercing people into adopting any religion. They have to willingly choose it.  gt;  gt;3. Islamic law forbids aggressive warfare. The Quran says,  #8220;But if the enemies incline towards peace, do you also incline towards peace. And trust in God! For He is the one who hears and knows all things. #8221; (8:61) The Quran chapter  #8220;The Cow, #8221; 2:190, says,  #8220;Fight in the way of God against those who fight against you, but begin not hostilities. Lo! God loveth not aggressors. #8221;  gt;  gt;4. In the Islamic law of war, not just any civil engineer can declare or launch a war. It is the prerogative of the duly constituted leader of the Muslim community that engages in the war. Nowadays that would be the president or prime minister of the state, as advised by the mufti or national jurisconsult.  gt;  gt;5. The killing of innocent non-combatants is forbidden. According to Sunni tradition,  #8216;Abu Bakr al-Siddiq, the first Caliph, gave these instructions to his armies:  #8220;I instruct you in ten matters: Do not kill women, children, the old, or the infirm; do not cut down fruit-bearing trees; do not destroy any town . . .  #8221; (Malik #8217;s Muwatta #8217;,  #8220;Kitab al-Jihad. #8221;)  gt;  gt;6. Terrorism or #160;hirabah #160;is forbidden in Islamic law, which groups it with brigandage, highway robbery and extortion rackets #8211; any illicit use of fear and coercion in public spaces for money or power. The principle of forbidding the spreading of terror in the land is based on the Qur #8217;an (Surah al-Ma #8217;ida 5:33 #8211;34). Prominent #160;[pdf] Muslim legal scholar Sherman Jackson writes,  #8220;The Spanish Maliki jurist Ibn `Abd al-Barr (d. 464/ 1070)) defines the agent of hiraba as  #8216;Anyone who disturbs free passage in the streets and renders them unsafe to travel, striving to spread corruption in the land by taking money, killing people or violating what God has made it unlawful to violate is guilty of hirabah . . . #8221;  gt;  gt;7. Sneak attacks are forbidden. Muslim commanders must give the enemy fair warning that war is imminent. The Prophet Muhammad at one point gave 4 months notice.  gt;  gt;8. The Prophet Muhammad counseled doing good to those who harm you and #160;is said to have commanded,  #8220;Do not be people without minds of your own, saying that if others treat you well you will treat them well, and that if they do wrong you will do wrong to them. Instead, accustom yourselves to do good if people do good and not to do wrong (even) if they do evil. #8221; (Al-Tirmidhi)  gt;  gt;9. The Qur #8217;an demands of believers that they exercise justice toward people even where they have reason to be angry with them:  #8220;And do not let the hatred of a people prevent you from being just. Be just; that is nearer to righteousness. #8221;[5:8]  gt;  gt;10. The Qur #8217;an assures Christians and Jews of paradise if they believe and do good works, and commends Christians as the best friends of Muslims. I wrote elsewhere,  #8220;Dangerous falsehoods are being promulgated to the American public. The Quran does not preach violence against Christians.  gt;  gt;Quran 5:69 says (Arberry):  #8220;Surely they that believe, and those of Jewry, and the Christians, and those Sabeaans, whoso believes in God and the Last Day, and works righteousness #8211;their wage waits them with their Lord, and no fear shall be on them, neither shall they sorrow. #8221;  gt;  gt;In other words, the Quran promises Christians and Jews along with Muslims that if they have faith and works, they need have no fear in the afterlife. It is not saying that non-Muslims go to hell #8211; quite the opposite.  gt;  gt;When speaking of the 7th-century situation in the Muslim city-state of Medina, which was at war with pagan Mecca, the Quran notes that the polytheists and some Arabian Jewish tribes were opposed to Islam, but then goes on to say:  gt;  gt;5:82.  #8221; . . . and you will find the nearest in love to the believers [Muslims] those who say:  #8216;We are Christians. #8217; That is because amongst them are priests and monks, and they are not proud. #8221;  gt;  gt;So the Quran not only does not urge Muslims to commit violence against Christians, it calls them  #8220;nearest in love #8221; to the Muslims! The reason given is their piety, their ability to produce holy persons dedicated to God, and their lack of overweening pride. That gave me much more to think about than your definition, how about you shipmate?  gt;it doesn't matter what the starving peasants think when their leadership is putting guns in their hands and telling them to shoot us. Wait, did I miss something? Did N. Korea attack us and I missed it? I mean seriously, are they starving peasants? Or are they a legitimate threat to the most powerful military on the planet? Because they certainly can't be both at the same time, can they? The Navy I was a sailor in wouldn't feel threatened by a bunch of starving peasants. Have things changed so drastically in my absence? Which do you think would have a better outcome? Rolling over a bunch of starving peasants in a preemptive strike? Or introducing them to freedom for the first time and allowing them to grow and prosper?  gt;yeah, because Trump is totalyl the same as a delusional fascist. If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck, and looks like a duck, it's probably not an elephant.  gt;If Trump wanted to glass NK he could have done it the last time they "tested" a ballistic missile. Ummm no, he couldn't. And yes, he wanted to. He's dying to nuke someone, he outright said as much during his campaign (or shortly after the election I can't remember exactly when). He *needs* a big giant deadly expensive war and what's been going on in the middle east is both not big enough and starting to die down. His greatest concern is the health of our economy and there is nothing in the world that stimulates an economy quite like war does.  gt;did we recently kill all of islam? News to me. Yeah, they've got absolutely no reason to dislike us at all, right? You're willing to commit genocide in order to exterminate an entire religion that you know nothing about and you consider yourself one of the "good guys". That's laughable.  gt;my "bloodlust" will be quenched when there isn't a religion of violence waging a holy war against my countrymen You're talking about Christianity right? I feel like you're talking about Christianity because that's the only religion I know of that is violently attacking my countrymen and women. Either way shipmate I hope that you're able to eventually find the path to both enlightenment and peace. I worry about your mental health with all of the fear , anger, and hate you display...but mostly the fear. It can be quite exhausting.

    <TEXT> gt;For there to be nothing means that life is truly worthless and you accept Nietchze and Stirner as truths to be followed which then completely devalues human life to simple chemical processes completely devoid of any sort of morality. I would say *that* is far worse than what I believe with the existence of God. I've never read Nietchze or Stirner so I can't comment on that, but I will say that the kind of belief you espoused absolutely terrifies me. As I'm sure you've picked up by now I do not subscribe to any particular religion, but I still consider myself to be a moral person. I do not need the threat of eternal damnation, or the promise of everlasting life, in order to do the right thing or be a good person. I do it because I want to and I do not expect to be rewarded during life or after death for doing so. It's absolutely terrifying to me to know that the Bible is the only thing keeping some Christians acting moral because what happens when or if religion is proven wrong?  gt;I'm not sure I can answer the second part of your response.

From now on I'll only do research on subjects from sources that already match my pre-conceived notions on a subject that way I won't be forced to think for myself. Life is so much easier that way.  gt;They've killed several soldiers over the supposed "ceasefire" period. So have we...I'm not seeing your point.  gt;validate your claims. Googled [Trump nukes](https://thinkprogress.org/9-terrifying-things-donald-trump-has-publicly-said-about-nuclear-weapons-99f6290bc32a/)  gt; gt;Donald Trump, speaking with a  #8220;foreign policy expert, #8221; repeatedly asked  #8220;why can #8217;t we use nuclear weapons. #8221;  gt;  gt; gt;MATHEWS: ...They're hearing a guy running for president of the United States talking of maybe using nuclear weapons.

    <TEXT> gt;Ignoring your assertion that laws don't matter - gt; But you are trying to argue that this somehow differentiates hourly and salaried workers (specifically negotiating). It doesn't, it's always illegal. So is forbidding or punishing discussing unionizing, but that doesn't stop it from happening all the time. I never said the laws don't matter, because they **were** an important protection for employees. They just happen to be impossible to enforce in conjuction with right to work laws unless the employer is stupid enough to explicitly say that an employee was terminated for an illegal reason.  gt;And why would an employer discriminate between hourly and salaried on this (illegal) issue? Why would they give one group a clear negotiating point and not the other? Because one group is generally management and the other one is being managed...by management. Are you really so sheltered that this is an alien concept to you? This is pretty basic stuff.</TEXT>

The thing that makes us great is that as a nation we do not seek the Republican answer or the Democratic answer to our problems, we seek the American answer. The gridlock that occurs when bipartisanship breaks down is intentional and its purpose is to prevent major changes from occurring until the American answer can be found, defined, and implemented. That breakdown in bipartisanship outdates the current administration, but instead of attempting to heal the divide they're choosing to increase the division and nothing can nor should get done until that changes.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I understand the difference, and I appreciate that you asked for clarification. I get irritated when my fast food order is wrong (which hardly ever happens contrary to internet lore). I don't really care for Diane Feinstein because she's out of touch and has been in office for far too long and I'm hoping to get to participate in voting her out of office soon. I strongly dislike Paul Ryan because he's a smug asshole who acts like he's entitled to be President at some point and he's just "waiting for his turn" (one of the many reasons I hated Hillary and refused to vote for her). I am appalled at what the political indifference and apathy displayed by the previous generation/s have allowed our government and society to become. Donald Trump on the other hand has always been the quintessential spoiled little rich kid who believes that as long as he has more money than his adversary, and can buy his way into "winning the deal", that nothing he does is wrong. He believes that those with the most money should make the rules, and even when they break the rules they make they should be immune from the consequences of doing so. He has no moral compass and doesn't possess an ounce of humility or class. He represents everything wrong with humanity in general and the United States and capitalism specifically and I hate him for it. His administration is proof that our government is for sale and that anyone with a charismatic attitude and buckets full of money can buy the Presidency...and I loathe and detest him for that. Short of bringing the entire world under the umbrella of the United States and forging everlasting world peace there isn't a single thing Trump can do to redeem himself from the sins he's committed in my eyes against humanity and this country before and after becoming POTUS. He's a worthless piece of shit without a single redeeming quality whatsoever. None of these words are said lightly and I mean every one of them. And his State of the Union address was nothing but bullshit and I hate him for that too. That all being said, he has done things I agree with and as long as he is POTUS he will have my support because his failure is our failure. If nothing else, his Presidency has created a shitstorm of awareness in public policy and I don't think we'll have to worry about indifference and apathy again for quite some time.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I made E-5 in 3 years and stayed there for 7. I took the E-6 test 9 times and even if I had cut a perfect test score I wouldn't have gotten advanced because my rate had a 1-2.5% advancement rate. I "voluntered" for base security at my last command when my Chief pulled me into his office and said, and I quote "In not allowed to say that your eval will suffer if you don't volunteer, but you should volunteer". At first I was pissed off, especially during pepper spray day during training, but I ended up liking it and put in a request to cross-rate so I could have the chance to advance before I hit high heat tenure at 14 (I had done the math and it was numerically impossible for me to hit E-6 before then in my own rate short of a CAP or EP, neither of which I networked enough to get). My request was approved by the MAs but denied by my own command so I said Fuck It and got out. It didn't make sense to me to work more than 10 years without a guaranteed retirement.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks for the insight. Gravity was a major concern of mine and I hadn't quite figured out how to address it yet, hence question 2. I was hoping to be able to get away with saying essentially "they created a mini-star" and allow it to have all of the properties of an actual star without having to explain the physics. The star isn't really central to the plot, but the source of a great light does play into the overall theme. As for the black hole idea, having to constantly feed it matter might create a problem. How much matter are we talking about? Relatively of course.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Writing a business plan is brutal. I wanted to open a smoke shop and had the perfect location in mind. I spent 8 months researching and writing my business plan and then went to the SBA. I needed $125k total and had over $25k. I found out that the SBA is essentially useless in that situation, at least they weren't interested in helping me at all beyond saying that I had written a pretty rock solid plan for someone with no previous experience at it. So I went to my credit union, which coincidentally was in a strip mall and shared a wall with my desired location, and they told me they'd love to help but they didn't do small business stuff...I couldn't even open a business account with them. When I walked out I saw a sign across the parking lot in a smaller space advertising "Smoke Shop Coming Soon". Ugh, that was a rough year.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've spent a good part of the last 25 years living paycheck to paycheck and you're right, it feels like drowning. I know how angry and jealous it can make someone to listen to people talking about the gains in their 401k's, or how well the stock market is doing, or how our economy is growing and knowing without question that none of those things will ever directly benefit you, because they don't apply to the world that you live in. I know how stressful it is to live your life a few missed paychecks away from losing everything, and I know how it feels when those paychecks gets missed and everything is lost. Thankfully I've never actually "slept on the streets", but I have been in positions where I legitimately didn't know where I was going to sleep that night after waking up in the morning. I'm now starting to rebuild slowly, but that just means I'm back at the drowning stage again and trying to stay afloat. I'd love to say it gets better, or that life gets easier, or that you learn to handle the stress...but I just can't. All you can do is keep on keeping on and doing the best you can with what you've got. Pick your teeth out of the curb, put them in your pocket, and move on to the next step. The only way to lose is to stop fighting because you don't have an opponent other than yourself. I wish you luck!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There are many things that drive inflation and the minimum wage is very low on the list...if it even makes the list at all. That being said, inflation is going to happen regardless so to hold the position that minimum wage should never be increased is just not logical. In the 80-some years that the minimum wage has existed it's been increased exactly 9 times...which if you're curious is as increase about every 9 years. If you're even more curious, the current rate was set in 2009...9 years ago. Every time before it gets increased there are people screaming and yelling that increasing it will lead to inflation and crash our economy, and every time after it is increased everything seems to work out just fine. Raising the minimum wage isn't a solution to any problem, it's a correction in wages to account for the fact that prices increase at least 2-3% every single year, so every year that minimum wage is maintained without an increase, those earning it effectively receive a pay cut...every single year...for an average of 9 years in a row...only for them to be subjected to people telling them that they need to STFU and be grateful for even having a job and asking for more money is insane, greedy, and will crash the economy when it comes time for another correction.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The 2nd Amendment states that *because* a "well regulated militia" is *necessary* for the security of a free state, the right of "the people" to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed. But what does that mean? To answer that we first need to define some of the terms being used. The Founding Fathers believed that a free state could not exist without a well regulated militia; that its existence was absolutely necessary for our nation's existence, so let's start there because I happen to agree with them. At the time it was written, something that was "well regulated" was something that was maintained in good working order and functioning as intended. So a "well regulated militia" would be one that was filled with people who were healthy and able bodied, responsible, armed with weapons they were proficient with, and ready and willing to fight when called upon if needed. With that in mind, I believe that every person who chooses to exercise their right to keep and bare arms is volunteering to be a member of this nation's militia by default...because as stated in the 2nd Amendment, it only exists to ensure that the militia has access to the arms they need to carry out their function. So what is the militia and what is its function? The militia is "the people" mentioned in the 2nd Amendment, and "the people" are the militia. The militia is more than a lynch mob or posse, but less than an army. It is a fighting force made up of common people called upon during times of extreme distress to maintain the safety and security of our free state. Because they are not an army, they do not have the budget nor logistics to supply their members with arms or supplies and as such, members are required to use their personally owned weapons and supplies when activated; the militia is quite frankly our nation's last line of defense against all enemies foreign and domestic and they need to arrive at the fight ready to engage immediately if called upon. So now that we've defined it, how can we ensure that our militia is well regulated? We'll get to its function a little later. First we have to ensure that they are healthy and able bodied. This can be accomplished by requiring individuals to submit to a health screening that includes a mental health check prior to being allowed to purchase a weapon. This screening should be completed by a licensed physician who has a knowledge of the history of the individual. (i. e. an individual's primary care physician, not a government sponsored "gun doctor"). This check should ensure that the individual is both physically and mentally capable of accepting the responsibility of legal gun ownership, and it should be repeated every 2-3 to 3-5 years for as long as the individual owns firearms. "Physician Approval" could be revoked at any time if the physician deems it prudent due to a change in the physical or mental health of a current gun owner. Physicians should be required to provide documentation to show "just cause" for denials or revocation, and should include what steps would be required in order for the individual to be approved (assuming the impairment is temporary and an individual's rights could be restored in the future). PCPs who question the mental state of a patient could require them to be evaluated by a licensed psychologist or psychiatrist to get a more thorough picture of their mental health prior to deciding whether to approve or deny an application. Every denial should be entered in a database to be easily indexed and checked as part of the background check for firearm purchases. I don't feel this would violate any HIPPA standards because the choice to exercise your right to keep and bear arms is made voluntarily, so any required HIPPA waiver that would need to be signed would be entered into voluntarily as well. I don't think any system could be perfect so some mentally ill people will invariably fall through the cracks and wind up possessing weapons they shouldn't have because nothing is fool proof, but at the same time I feel expecting or demanding a zero percent fail rate is unreasonable. For that reason I don't feel any doctor should be held liable or responsible for approving an application for someone who then goes on to kill innocent people unless it was obvious negligence on the doctor's part that allowed the possession, or continued possession, to occur. So now we've determined that they're healthy and able bodied, next we have to ensure they are responsible. This can be easily accomplished via the criminal background check system currently in place. That system should be expanded to include every gun purchase and sale so it needs to be accessible to the public for a nominal fee to facilitate private party sales and end the "gun show loophole". No firearms should be legally sold in this country without the buyer first having undergone a background check and health screening. Ok they have demonstrated they are healthy, able bodied, and responsible so now we need to ensure that they are armed with weapons they are proficient with. Because an "unregulated militia" has the potential to cause more harm than good, we need to ensure that our militia is capable of carrying out their function without causing undue harm to others during times when they are needed. When it was written, there was no need to include firearm training in the 2nd Amendment because an individual who couldn't shoot well didn't typically eat well. Firearms were a much larger part of the average person's life back then so they maintained both their weapon and their skill of using it safely and effectively more than the average person today does so we need to ensure gun owners are skilled in the safe and effective use of their weapons. This can be accomplished by requiring prospective gun owners to complete a 40hr gun safety course prior to their first purchase, and complete an annual 8hr refresher course for as long as they own firearms. Gun owners should be required to demonstrate their proficiency by shooting a qualifying course of fire every 6 months for every type and caliber of weapon owned. (i. e. an individual that owns four 9mm semi-automatic handguns from different manufacturers would only need to shoot 1 of them, but an individual that owned 4 Glocks all of different calibers would need to shoot all 4. The same rules would apply to long guns and shotguns. This requirement could be satisfied by individuals submitting documentation that shows regular trips to the range, filled tags that document successful hunts, or other such information that shows regular practice. So now they're healthy and able bodied, responsible, and effectively armed...but are they willing and able to fight if called upon? Individuals would demonstrate their willingness to fight if needed by simply exercising their right and purchasing a weapon. But what kind of weapons should be available to members of the militia, and by extension the people? I think that should be determined by the purpose of the militia itself. So what's the purpose of this militia I keep talking about? As I said before, the militia is our country's last line of defense against both attack and tyranny; but how do they accomplish that mission? I feel that the most effective use of the militia during the times they would be needed would be to utilize them to maintain law and order in a given area of responsibility (i. e. their "home turf" whether it's local, state, or national depending on the circumstances) since the Posse Comitatus Act prohibits the use of the military to perform that function on American soil. Keeping that in mind, in order to maintain law and order a militia needs access to all of the tools necessary to perform that task. That means that members of the militia should be able to keep and bear any weapon that is available for use on duty to any officer or agent of every law enforcement agency in the country. To be clear, I'm speaking strictly toward law enforcement. Weapons available for use by members of the military do not apply to this discussion as members of the military aren't simply citizens. Officers and agents of law enforcement are citizens first and their respective careers second, while members of the military are soldiers first and citizens second. If a law enforcement agency determines that a particular weapon is necessary in order to fulfill their function, that weapon should be available for use by the citizenry that agency serves. Weapons used by local LE agencies would be available to everyone in that jurisdiction, weapons available to state agencies would be available to everyone in that state, and weapons available to federal agencies would be available to everyone in the country because I feel that a government that uses weapons against its citizens that it prohibits those citizens from possessing themselves is the definition of oppressive. Officers and agents of law enforcement are not a special class of citizen and should not be given more rights than others based on their chosen profession. I should know, I proudly served as a Federal Law Enforcement Officer for 5 years once upon a time in what seems like a lifetime ago. Continued below...</TEXT>

    <TEXT>...Continued from above I don't see any reason to allow a person who does not agree with what I feel are completely reasonable and absolutely common sense restrictions to own a firearm. I also don't see any reason to restrict the type of weapons that can be owned by someone who successfully completes these steps as they will have demonstrated that they are capable of being safe and responsible gun owners, and any gun in the hands of a safe and responsible individual is no more dangerous than any other. Any person who was found in possession of a weapon, and not in compliance with the law, would be punished severely (I feel a sentence in the 20 to life neighborhood would be appropriate). Now you may be asking yourself "What does this have to do with school shootings and how does any of this make us safer?". The answer is quite simply "Nothing, and it doesn't". My thoughts are not about safety, they are geared toward building and establishing the well regulated militia that our forefathers knew was absolutely vital to our survival, because eventually they're going to be needed, and if they were to be called up tomorrow the one that would report would be anything but "well regulated" as a whole. Safety is an illusion, it always has been and it always will be, and it's usually an incredibly expensive illusion to maintain. No, my thoughts are not intended to make us safe, they are intended to keep us free because you cannot be both safe and free at the same time. It simply can't be done. Now I'm going to address the obvious elephant that I've left in the corner. In order to track compliance with everything I've proposed, it will effectively create a database of gun owners that carries a high potential for abuse by both a tyrannical government and thieves looking for targets...among others. As I said before, expecting or demanding a zero percent failure rate is just not reasonable, and that cuts both ways. I feel we've reached a point in society where such a database is simply unavoidable, and being included in it is just the price an individual has to pay in order to exercise their right. The level of the illusion of safety demanded by the public requires it, and I feel that demand is perfectly reasonable. I feel the risk to the individual if it is abused is far outweighed by the benefits such a database would provide to society.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't believe the conclusion you've drawn is logical at all and in fact I think it's quite outlandish and poorly thought out. In the event of a tyrannical government, the people are not going to take up arms and march on Washington to engage the government in a fire fight because that's sheer lunacy. The most logical response to a tyrannical government is to simply succeed from that government's control and declare yourself independent. The only thing required for people to achieve that independence is to defend the ground they occupy. It is so rare to defeat an entrenched fighting force using guerrilla tactics to defend their own land that it has almost never happened throughout history. Some of the greatest wars ever lost were lost to the underdog defending home turf with seemingly insufficient firepower. Peasants and farmers were able to successful defend the ground they occupied against the full power of the US military for over a decade in Vietnam. Freedom fighters in the Middle East have been doing the same for over a century. It almost doesn't matter how big and bad your army is, you are almost guaranteed to fail when you try to invade an area you're unfamiliar with, against the wishes of an armed local population intent on keeping you out. In the event of a revolt, the idea that the US government would use nuclear weapons against both people and land they were trying to retain control of is absurd. There is no "win" achieved by nuking your own soil, be realistic.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; handguns and AR-15s are just not sufficient to ward of the tyranny of a nuclear superpower. This is just patently false. It is so rare to defeat an entrenched fighting force using guerrilla tactics to defend their own land that it has almost never happened throughout history. Some of the greatest wars ever lost were lost to the underdog defending home turf with seemingly insufficient firepower and personnel. Peasants and farmers were able to successfully defend the ground they occupied against the full power of the US military (the only nuclear power in the history of mankind that has ever actually used one against an enemy) for over a decade in Vietnam. Freedom fighters in the Middle East have been successfully defending their own land for over a century, at times against multiple tyrannical nuclear superpowers at once, with primitive weapons and camels. It almost doesn't matter how big and bad your army is, you are almost guaranteed to fail when you try to invade an area you're unfamiliar with, against the wishes of an armed local population intent on keeping you out. As for the nuclear angle. If the people lead a revolt against the government, that revolt will not be an armed march on DC to engage in a fire fight with the government over "freedom" *cue Mel Gibson*. A revolt will simply be a group of people succeeding from the country and declaring their independence, and the only necessary for them to achieve that independence is for them to successfully defend the ground they occupy. If you're a betting man, history says the safe bet is on the insurgents occupying home turf regardless of how out manned or outgunned they are. A government fighting insurgents intent on freedom is not trying to annihilate them, they're trying to bring them back into the fold. There is no "win" achieved by nuking your own soil during a revolt, be realistic.</TEXT>

This can be accomplished by requiring individuals to submit to a health screening that includes a mental health check prior to being allowed to purchase a weapon. This screening should be completed by a licensed physician who has a knowledge of the history of the individual. (i. e. an individual's primary care physician, not a government sponsored "gun doctor"). This check should ensure that the individual is both physically and mentally capable of accepting the responsibility of legal gun ownership, and it should be repeated every 2-3 to 3-5 years for as long as the individual owns firearms. "Physician Approval" could be revoked at any time if the physician deems it prudent due to a change in the physical or mental health of a current gun owner. Physicians should be required to provide documentation to show "just cause" for denials or revocation, and should include what steps would be required in order for the individual to be approved (assuming the impairment is temporary and an individual's rights could be restored in the future). PCPs who question the mental state of a patient could require them to be evaluated by a licensed psychologist or psychiatrist to get a more thorough picture of their mental health prior to deciding whether to approve or deny an application. Every denial should be entered in a database to be easily indexed and checked as part of the background check for firearm purchases. I don't feel this would violate any HIPAA standards because the choice to exercise your right to keep and bear arms is made voluntarily, so any required HIPAA waiver that would need to be signed would be entered into voluntarily as well. I don't think any system could be perfect so some mentally ill people will invariably fall through the cracks and wind up possessing weapons they shouldn't have because nothing is fool proof, but at the same time I feel expecting or demanding a zero percent fail rate is unreasonable. For that reason I don't feel any doctor should be held liable or responsible for approving an application for someone who then goes on to kill innocent people unless it was obvious negligence on the doctor's part that allowed the possession, or continued possession, to occur. So now we've determined that they're healthy and able bodied, next we have to ensure they are responsible. This can be easily accomplished via the criminal background check system currently in place. That system should be expanded to include every gun purchase and sale so it needs to be accessible to the public for a nominal fee to facilitate private party sales and end the "gun show loophole". No firearms should be legally sold in this country without the buyer first having undergone a background check and health screening. Ok they have demonstrated they are healthy, able bodied, and responsible so now we need to ensure that they are armed with weapons they are proficient with. Because an "unregulated militia" has the potential to cause more harm than good, we need to ensure that our militia is capable of carrying out their function without causing undue harm to others during times when they are needed. When it was written, there was no need to include firearm training in the 2nd Amendment because an individual who couldn't shoot well didn't typically eat well. Firearms were a much larger part of the average person's life back then so they maintained both their weapon and their skill of using it safely and effectively more than the average person today does so we need to ensure gun owners are skilled in the safe and effective use of their weapons. This can be accomplished by requiring prospective gun owners to complete a 40hr gun safety course prior to their first purchase, and complete an annual 8hr refresher course for as long as they own firearms. Gun owners should be required to demonstrate their proficiency by shooting a qualifying course of fire every 6 months for every type and caliber of weapon owned. (i. e. an individual that owns four 9mm semi-automatic handguns from different manufacturers would only need to shoot 1 of them, but an individual that owned 4 Glocks all of different calibers would need to shoot all 4. The same rules would apply to long guns and shotguns. This requirement could be satisfied by individuals submitting documentation that shows regular trips to the range, filled tags that document successful hunts, or other such information that shows regular practice. So now they're healthy and able bodied, responsible, and effectively armed...but are they willing and able to fight if called upon? Individuals would demonstrate their willingness to fight if needed by simply exercising their right and purchasing a weapon. But what kind of weapons should be available to members of the militia, and by extension the people? I think that should be determined by the purpose of the militia itself. So what's the purpose of this militia I keep talking about? As I said before, the militia is our country's last line of defense against both attack and tyranny; but how do they accomplish that mission? I feel that the most effective use of the militia during the times they would be needed would be to utilize them to maintain law and order in a given area of responsibility (i. e. their "home turf" whether it's local, state, or national depending on the circumstances) since the Posse Comitatus Act prohibits the use of the military to perform that function on American soil. In the event our government becomes tyrannical, the revolution that would occur would not take the form of Americans taking up arms to march on DC and engage our government in a fire fight, that's just sheer lunacy. The most logical response to a tyrannical government is for the people to simply succeed and declare their independence, and the only thing necessary for them to maintain that independence is to simply defend the ground they occupy. It is so rare to defeat an entrenched fighting force using guerrilla tactics to defend their own land that it has almost never happened throughout human history. Some of the greatest wars ever lost were lost to the underdog defending home turf with seemingly insufficient firepower and personnel. Peasants and farmers were able to successfully defend the ground they occupied against the full power of the US military (a nuclear power at the time and the only one in the history of mankind to ever use one against an enemy) for over a decade in Vietnam. Freedom fighters in the Middle East have been successfully defending their own land for over a century, at times against multiple tyrannical nuclear powers at once, with primitive weapons and camels. It almost doesn't matter how big and bad your army is, you are almost guaranteed to fail when you try to invade an area you're unfamiliar with, against the wishes of an armed local population intent on keeping you out. As far as the nuclear angle is concerned, a government fighting a revolting population is not attempting to annihilate them, they are attempting to bring them back into the fold in order to continue enjoying the goods and resources produced by that population. There is no "win" achieved by nuking your own soil in an attempt to kill a rebellion and I feel it's ridiculous to even entertain the idea that it would be an option. Keeping all of that in mind, in order to maintain law and order a militia needs access to all of the tools necessary to perform that task. That means that members of the militia, and by extension the people, should be able to keep and bear any weapon that is available for use on duty to any officer or agent of every law enforcement agency in the country. To be clear, I'm speaking strictly toward law enforcement. Weapons of war only available for use by members of the military do not apply to this discussion as members of the military aren't simply citizens. Officers and agents of law enforcement are citizens first and their respective careers second, while members of the military are soldiers first and citizens second. If a law enforcement agency determines that a particular weapon is necessary in order to fulfill their function, that weapon should be available for use by the citizenry that agency serves. Weapons used by local LE agencies should be available to everyone in that jurisdiction, weapons available to state agencies should be available to everyone in that state, and weapons available to federal agencies should be available to everyone in the country because I feel that a government that uses weapons against its citizens that it prohibits those citizens from possessing themselves is the definition of oppressive. Officers and agents of law enforcement are not a special class of citizen and should not be given more rights than others based on their chosen profession. I should know, I proudly served as a Federal Law Enforcement Officer for 5 years once upon a time in what seems like a lifetime ago, and I wasn't anything special when I was filling that role. I don't see any reason to allow a person who does not agree with what I feel are completely reasonable and absolutely common sense gun control measures to own a firearm. I also don't see any reason to restrict the type of weapons that can be owned by someone who successfully completes these steps as they will have demonstrated that they are capable of being safe and responsible gun owners, and any gun in the hands of a safe and responsible individual is no more dangerous than any other. Any person who was found in possession of a weapon, and not in compliance with the law, would be punished severely (I feel a sentence in the 20 to life neighborhood would be appropriate). Now you may be asking yourself "What does this have to do with school shootings and how does any of this make us safer?". The answer is quite simply "Nothing, and it doesn't". My thoughts are not about safety because safety is an illusion. It always has been and it always will be, and it's usually an incredibly expensive illusion to maintain. My thoughts are geared toward building and establishing the well regulated militia that our forefathers knew was absolutely vital to our survival, because eventually they're going to be needed, and if they were to be called up tomorrow the one that would report would be anything but "well regulated" as a whole. No, my thoughts are not intended to make us safe, they are intended to keep us free because **you cannot be both safe and free at the same time**. It simply can't be done. Now I'm going to address the obvious elephant that I've left over in the corner. In order to track compliance with everything I've proposed, it will effectively create a database of gun owners that carries a high potential for abuse by both a tyrannical government and thieves looking for targets...among others. As I said before, expecting or demanding a zero percent failure rate is just not reasonable, and that cuts both ways. I feel we've reached a point in society where such a database is simply unavoidable, and being included in it is just the price an individual has to pay in order to exercise their right. The level of the illusion of safety demanded by the public requires it, and I feel that demand is perfectly reasonable. I feel the risk to the individual if it is abused is far outweighed by the benefits such a database would provide to society.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thank you so much. I am genuinely humbled by your words of praise both here and in private.  gt;I work in an office of ardent Republicans that proudly carry their concealed weapons on the daily...it seems more like a phallic extension of their ego than for personal safety. If anyone around you knows that you are carrying a concealed weapon, you are not carrying a weapon responsibly in my opinion. Unless both spouses are carrying I don't even like the idea of your spouse knowing you have a weapon...and especially not your children under normal circumstances. The mere presence of a gun in a situation escalates it, even if the person with the gun is the only one who knows it's present. The more people that know about it, the higher the escalation gets. I believe you are exactly right about ego; if anyone knows you have a gun, you aren't carrying a weapon for self defense, you're carrying an object that boosts your ego...and that demonstrates an utter lack of firearm discipline. In my opinion, the root of America's gun problem lies in the fact that a disturbingly high number of gun owners (both legal and illegal) have lost nearly all firearm discipline. I feel if my ideas were to be implemented, that horrifying trend would be dramatically reduced. The problem with the very vocal "shall not be infringed" movement on the right is that they conveniently forget the "well regulated" portion of the amendment that precedes those words. The problem with the heavy gun control/gun ban movement on the left is that they genuinely don't understand the gravity of not only giving up a constitutionally protected right, but outright demanding that it be removed. Those who believe that the 2nd Amendment does not protect against a tyrannical government because of the military haven't thought logically about the issue and don't understand what a 21st century American revolution would look like. Even if the government attempted to use the military against the American population, 20-40% would mutiny and join the other side (taking their weapons, equipment, and tools with them) and another 20-40% would simply abandon their post and walk away. Members of the military are not mindless drones or machines and if ordered to fire on the American citizens they took an oath to protect, most would be unwilling to do so. Attacking your oppressor to gain your freedom is only viable if you're already captive or it's a "hail mary" last resort. Freedom isn't something you have to fight for, it's something you possess as a virtue of being alive. You don't attack your oppressors to fight for your freedom, because your oppressors are not the source of your freedom. You defend the freedom you possess by standing your ground and telling your oppressors that if they want your freedom they'll have to come and take it.  gt;I don't like the idea of just anyone obtaining a firearm, but I am also not going to tell someone they don't have the right to do something simply on the basis that it is not something I personally choose to engage in. Thank you for not only holding this position, but for stating it publicly in an open forum. I know that the majority of people believe the same thing, but it's so rarely stated so clearly that it seems like it's becoming less common for people to believe this.  gt;It would be unfair to pretend like we are handling this issue responsibly. This is painfully accurate.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I had totally forgotten I'd even written this lol. I comment on his Facebook posts fairly regularly and was frustrated with his utter lack of interaction with his constituents there when I wrote it. A few weeks ago he posted something about the tax plan saying that the typical northern California household will see an extra $1,600/year due to its contents. I left a comment explaining that if there were 10 households in a neighborhood and 1 of them received $16,000 and the other 9 had $1,600 taken from them the "typical household" in that neighborhood received $160, and to my absolute shock he actually replied. I mean his response was as devoid of facts as his initial post, but I was still totally geeked that he at least acknowledged my existence.  gt;So, where's a good place to put my money and time in helping install someone in that office who does care? I haven't seen anything about his potential opponents yet, but at this point I'd be happy with another republican in there if it meant getting his worthless ass out of office.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I respect your position, but you don't offer many details about it. You say that you feel the 2nd Amendment is due for some changes and that's something that I could support if the changes were meaningful. I formed my position on this subject based on the wording of the amendment as it has stood for almost 250 years, and you'd like to see that wording changed. That begs the question; what changes would make you comfortable? What should be the policy for private gun ownership in a free country in your opinion?</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;The simple fact is: the stated purpose:  gt;  gt; gt; security of a free State  gt;  gt;was from a time when standing armies weren't really a thing. Now we have one, to defend against external threats. Ok, so WWIII breaks out and after a decade of devastation, and against all odds, we actually lose this one because 80% of our military just got nuked halfway around the world. The government that just won the war comes to our doorstep looking for their spoils. How is that standing army that you're counting on to come save the day going to help you when they're all dead? The militia (you, me, and everyone else whether we like it or not) is the last line of defense. ***WE*** are the failsafe built into the system to ensure that our way of life survives. Period. When the big bad wolf comes knocking on the door, wouldn't you feel a little more secure with a rifle in your hands? Even if they were trembling with fear... The 2nd Amendment doesn't exist for the good prosperous times like we've seen recently, it exists for those times that you don't like to think about when you're alone in the dark. It exists for those times and those situations that can't be planned for. It exists to provide a response to the unthinkable.  gt;As far as internal tyranny? If it gets bad to have a Tienanmen Square event here, there is *nothing* that the people can do if the military turns against us. They have nukes, for Oppenheimer's sake! "We have to surrender! There is *nothing* we can do if the king sends his entire army our way! They have fleets of ships for Poseidon's sake!! -Our Founding Fathers (probably) What follows may sound harsh but it's something I feel you need to hear (assuming you're an American). WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU?!?! Do you really think that the hundreds of thousands of people who have proudly and valiantly given their lives over the last 250 years in order to make sure that you were born in and live in the greatest fucking country in the history of mankind deserve to hear you willing to roll over and lick your balls at the first hint of trouble? I mean seriously, think about the words "Give me liberty or give me death!", "I regret that I have but one life to give for my country.", "Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country.". I mean really think about those words for a minute. Go read them again and let them sink in. Put yourself in the shoes of someone proudly proclaiming that they would rather die than live under tyranny...and then fucking died to prove it. How could you possibly even consider surrender an option when defending your own freedom from tyranny, even in the face of certain death?! Not only no, but hell fucking no. Not today. Not on my watch. I know this sounds like an angry rant but it's really not, it's heartbreaking. I'm not angry, I'm fucking devastated. I can't believe there is someone in the country that I dedicated 15 years of my life to defending who would rather live as a slave than die defending the freedom they possess by virtue of being alive. The Constitution does not provide you your freedom, and you are not free because you're an American. Your freedom belongs to you because **you are alive** and as long as those three words are true it can only be taken from you if you willingly give it up. Never fucking give it up. ***ever *** I detailed in my original post why nukes are a ridiculous thing to bring up when discussing a revolution so I won't revisit that, but I do want to clue you in on a little something you may not understand about the military. The military is not full of highly educated "thinking" type people because it doesn't attract those kinds of people. The military is full of kids from run of the mill working class families from small towns. The military preys on these kids because they can offer them the one thing that they can't provide themselves; a way out of their current situation. A small number of military members actually join out of a self imposed duty to honor their country and those who came before. The vast majority of them however join because they are looking for a way out. Out of their small town, out of their horrible home life, out of a predetermined destiny of a career at the mill, out of a life where college is impossible, out of whatever fucked up situation they're in that they see the military as the only viable option because they can't get out on their own. Sounds pretty desperate doesn't it? When I was 25 years old I was running an avionics work center and had 28 people working directly under me who called me Gramps because I was the oldest one there. We were responsible for maintaining and repairing the internal communications system so the 4 aircrew could talk to each other, 6 different radios to all 4 seats, all external communications, 2 different types of radar, all navigation and aircraft identification systems, and a whole host of classified electronic warfare equipment on 4 jets, pretty important stuff for military aircraft...and at 25 I was the oldest one and in charge of it all. 60-80% of the military looks just like that. With the exception of the occasional diamond in the rough, none of the thousands of people I met during my 10 years of active duty were exceptionally bright. I don't mean that to be insulting because they weren't dumb (well there were those too), but exceptionally bright people typically find something more rewarding to do with their lives than join the military. Every single one of them had one thing in common though, they loved this country more than they loved themselves. More importantly than that though, they loved the people that make up this country and most of them would die before hurting their fellow countrymen and women. I am absolutely confident that if given orders to attack Americans, 30-40% would immediately mutiny and join the public (taking their weapons, gear, tools, and even aircraft with them), another 30-40% would simply abandon their post and walk away, and the rest would be spineless fucking weasels who would rather live as slaves than die defending the freedom they possess by virtue of being alive.  gt;For personal defense, other countries have *proven* that eliminating guns entirely does far more for people's safety than arming them. All of the countries you are referring to are either not "free countries" or they are only capable of doing so because their country is protected by the full force of the US military...or both.  gt;Use of a firing range for no purpose other than entertainment isn't necessarily valid. There are plenty of dangerous-but-enjoyable activities that are severely restricted, if not categorically forbidden. That said, keeping all weapons on-site and requiring would be a stable solution. Gun ranges have to exist, they are unavoidable. Entertainment via gun range is simply a way to profit from their existence when they aren't being utilized for their primary purpose.  gt;So, the only useful purpose is hunting (including pest control and management of out-of-control wildlife - likely the only animal that requires special care is bear). And a fundamental principle of hunting is "take one shot; then wait and see since you probably don't need to shoot again". So there is absolutely no need for a weapon that can fire 10 rounds per second, or even 1 round per second. And no reason to have a magazine with more than 5 rounds. It's not popular to say in pro-gun circles but it's the truth. The purpose of a weapon that holds a 30 round clip that can be discharged at a high rate of fire is to injure or kill human beings as quickly and efficiently as possible. It's ugly, but it's true. Why should people be allowed to own them? Because it's better to own one and hope that you never have to use it, than it is to need one and not have it. I understand that this makes you feel less safe, but it really does make you more free.  gt;Besides all the uses by ordinary people, if police could stop carrying guns regularly, it would massively decrease the incidence of police brutality. It has been shown that the mere act of police carrying a gun, even if they never draw it, causes them to act aggressively rather than keeping the peace. That was cute. I really enjoy it when people who have never worn a badge tell me what is like to be a cop. It's always fun.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;In a city like Los Angeles, you would have absolute bedlam within weeks. In a small town, the local opioid or meth baron would be able to amass an arsenal very quickly... Um, all of that is currently already happening. The only people currently unable to obtain the number or type of weapons you're talking about are the ones who attempt to do so legally. Also, while you addressed the types of weapons I would like to see allowed, you failed to address the *reason* I feel they should be allowed.  gt;"I feel that a government that uses weapons against its citizens that it prohibits those citizens from possessing themselves is the definition of oppressive." What is your response to that? You've also failed to see the flip side of the coin that I've proposed with this idea. If you want to limit the types of weapons available to common citizens under my plan, first limit the types of weapons available to law enforcement. Isn't reversing the trend of militarizing police departments kind of important to the gun control crowd?  gt; That's an awfully broad statement. We have seat belts, and roll cages, and build our houses with flame retardant materials because such regulations make us safer. And yet we still have people dying in accidents while wearing seat belts, still have people dying in accidents while driving cars with roll cages, and still have people dying in house fires. You are confusing a reduction in risk to being safe. You have never been safe a single day in your entire life, yet here you are. We can mitigate risk, but we can never achieve safety because **you can't be both safe and free at the same time**...and freedom is of far more importance. You can make a car, a house, even food safer through regulation...but no amount of regulation will ever make people safer for other people.  gt;I'm not opposed to there being an actual, federally regulated militia which people may join You are equating the "regulated" word in the amendment with the current usage of the word today. Also, what you're proposing already exists in the form of state and national guard units. There are no "regulations" with regards to a "well regulated militia", that's not what they're talking about. A militia is not an officially organized group complete with membership drives and rosters. A militia is the group of people who arrive when the shit hits the fan and "official help" is either not coming or won't arrive in time.  gt;provided we are subject to the rigorous training and check ups you listed, as well as interviews with family, friends, ex girlfriends, and co-workers. I've held a security clearance with the military and didn't submit to something that in-depth. Ex-girlfriends? You've got the be trolling, right? Tell me you've recognized why that is a monumentally bad idea and you're trolling. And as a pre-emptive response to "maybe he was abusive and shouldn't have access to a gun", if that were true she should have reported it to the proper authorities when it was safe for her to do so, not after someone tracks her down to specifically ask her about it.</TEXT>

It has a handful of isolated incidents of such, but nothing that could be even remotely described as "a long history".  gt;We recently had "milita' people seize land in a national park. And while I personally disagree with the decision, the very government that they took up arms against determined they hadn't committed a crime in doing so and set them free. Not exactly a great argument for your position.  gt;I do not believe American citizens have the right to take up arms against the US Federal Government under any circumstances. "I do not believe colonists have the right to take up arms against the crown under any circumstances." -Our Founding Fathers (probably) Since this is tied for the most personally devastating sentence I've ever heard an American citizen say in the 40 years I've been walking this Earth, I'm going to give you the same response I gave the other individual who said something similar...on this very same post. What follows may sound harsh but it's something I feel you need to hear. WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU?!?! ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME?!?!?!

Average citizens should not have nukes. I agree, but we're discussing the weapons the government would *actually* use against the American people, and the US government has never, would never, and will never use nuclear weapons against American citizens occupying American territory under any circumstances period. To believe different is just about the most uninformed and ignorant position a person could possibly take. As I have said before, there is no "win" achieved by nuking your own people on your own soil, be realistic.  gt;Possible domestic violence seems like a good reason to deny someone a gun to me. I absolutely agree, and it's currently illegal for those with domestic violence **convictions** to own firearms. If your hypothetical ex-girlfriend genuinely thought their ex was a danger to society, they should report them as soon as it's safe to do so...not after the "gun interviewer" comes along. Did you seriously just advocate for dangerously violent individuals confronting those who made accusations against them to withdraw their story? What fucking planet am I living on?!?!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I can't speak to Lasik specifically but I can give you my experience with Photorefractive keratectomy [PRK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photorefractive_keratectomy) corrective surgery. Ever since the 4th grade I couldn't see, and by I couldn't see I mean my vision was 20/400. That means that something that a normal person could see clearly at 400 ft, I had to be 20 feet away from in order to see. To give an example of what this means, I could be laying in bed in a pitch black room and I could not read the digital display of my alarm clock on the nightstand next to my bed from a distance of less than 3 feet without my glasses on. When I was 25 and in the Navy I lucked out and got the procedure done for free through the military. They put some drops in my eyes to numb them, then clamped my eye open and put me under the machine. The actual laser part of the procedure took 29 seconds in one eye and 31 seconds in the other and as soon as it was completed they put protective lenses in my eyes (basically contacts without any correction in them) and took me to an exam room for an eye test. Less than five minutes had elapsed since the laser and my uncorrected vision was 20/40 and I was sent home. 3 days later I had another test and my vision had improved to 20/20. 1 week after that I had another test and my vision was 20/10. That was 15 years ago and as of my last exam about 12-18 months ago I am still at 20/10. I really can't say enough good things about this procedure, it was hands down one of the best decisions I've ever made. 10/10 would see again.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>When I arrived on the morning of my procedure they put some drops in my eyes to numb them then gave me a percocet and a valium and had me wait in the lobby area. There was about 15-20 of us getting it done that day so it was kinda just wait your turn. About 45 min later it was my turn and I was feeling pretty easy going and relaxed thanks to big pharma. During the procedure I had to concentrate on a red light in the machine, if my eye moved away from the light the machine knew it and stopped the laser until I looked back at it. Because of that I would guess it's highly unlikely that you could do it under sedation. Some of the other procedures possibly, I don't really know much about them, but for PRK specifically I doubt it. Besides, I was only underneath the machine for about 5 minutes, and only really uncomfortable for about 2. It really wasn't that bad all in all. The worst of the worst pain involved felt like a mild sunburn on my eyeballs, and for a few days after it felt like I had grit or fine sand in my eyes. Please don't let anxiety be the reason you don't do this if you have the ability and desire to get it done. It really did change my life and I couldn't be happier with my results. I didn't tell my current eye doctor about my surgery until after he had completed my initial exam and after I told him he did another quick exam and was shocked that he couldn't see any scarring or anything on my corneas and if I hadn't told him he never would've known.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Meanwhile, the pain patient doesn't get a high from them... This is patently false. The pain patient gets accustomed to the high because they never experience sobriety. Ever. My wife has had CRPS for over 10 years and was on some form of opioids for 8 of them. She has been off all forms of them for over 2 years, has less overall pain without them than she enjoyed with them, and if you ask her she was never high or impaired a single day during those 8 years and she took them exactly as prescribed and only as prescribed. If you talk to me or our children though we'll describe 8 years of a seriously impaired individual acting like they were completely functional and fully sober. The high pain patients experience is obvious to everyone except the pain patient. They are oblivious to it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Look I'm not disparaging anyone, nor am I criticizing anyone. I'm simply being realistic about the situation. We are talking about mind altering chemicals and you can't argue against chemistry. I'm not saying they make everyone who takes them non-functional, nor am I saying that all pain patients are addicts. I'm saying that *all* pain patients who take a prescribed regiment of opioid narcotics day in and day out suffer some form of impairment from them. That level of impairment will differ with every individual, but it will absolutely be present in some form in each individual whether they can see it or not. I applaud your ability to manage a chronic illness as a single mother, I really do. But your belief that your narcotic use didn't negatively impact your relationship with your child only affirms my beliefs, because it absolutely did in a thousand different ways that wouldn't matter at all on their own, but combined had at least some impact. That doesn't make you a bad mom, I'm sure you were a wonderful mom, it just makes you a mom doing the best she can in the situating she's in.  gt;So don't assume that everyone is like your wife. Maybe you could have been a good spouse  amp; gone to an appt with her to explain to the dr what you were seeing. Could have helped her... You should take your own advice. My wife has never been to a single doctors appointment on her own. I gave up a 75+k/year career to stay at home and earn minimum wage as her caretaker. I have been by her side and involved with every aspect of her care from day one. I have held her hand and been her rock through every one of the 19 surgeries she's undergone over the last 10 years, and I was instrumental in her recovery from the spinal cord injury she sustained during one of them. Nobody on this planet has helped her more or cared more for her than I have, her family included. So you can debate me on my thoughts on this subject all day long, I'm happy for the mental exercise, but don't for a hot fucking second assume ***anything*** about the relationship I have with my wife because you don't know the first fucking thing about me.</TEXT>

What I said was that they cannot be used without impairment. It's simple chemistry. I personally feel any adult over the age of 21 should be able to legally purchase personal use quantities of them to use recreationally if they so choose, just like every other drug known to man.</TEXT>

There were all kinds of announcements and emails about operational security flying around the ship telling everyone that it was not Ok to tell folks back home that we were passing the rock or anything that would give away the ship's position. A few hours later we were watching CNN (affectionately referred to as the Classified News Network at the time) and there's a live action shot of the aircraft carrier I was on as it passed the rock...pretty much telling the entire world exactly where we were.

Instead of just logging into program, students would be immersed in an entire virtual world (WoW meets Second Life). They would have missions and goals all geared toward consuming knowledge and learning skills instead of being taught how to pass a test. As students demonstrated proficiency in a topic they would earn XP to level their character up and unlock more advanced lessons. We have access to the kind of technology that kids never want to turn off and the way it's currently underutilized is shameful. If we can find a way to grab their attention and make learning fun, we can give our kids the equivalent of what is currently a high school education by the time they're 10-12 and an associates or even bachelor level by 18.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My closest friend and I have discussed this at length on multiple occasions. Here's where I land on the freedom of the press as it pertains to modern day America. I cannot support government censorship of the press under any circumstances. Even in situations where members of the press obtain information they shouldn't possess, I feel they are still duty bound to report it to the public. And I also feel that duty protects them from prosecution when they do. At the same time, I feel that the media is responsible, if not totally at least in part, for nearly all of our current social problems. The sensationalized spin used by the media to attract viewers and increase profits necessitates elevating minor stories far above the level they should be in order to fill airtime. In my opinion, the drive for higher profits has perverted the press, like it has the media, and in order to correct it we have to remove the profit motive. I think we need to draw a clear and direct line between "the media" and "the press". "The Press" (and the freedom of) exist to keep the population informed of the things that effect their lives at national, state, and local levels. "The Media" exists to entertain the population in whatever way makes the entertainer the most money for their effort. The line between the two has gotten blurred over the last 20-30 years and we are currently experiencing the effects of it in almost all facets of American life. I think it has come time to require "the press" aka news organizations to operate as 501(c)(3) non-profit organizations. The media can continue to operate as they want, but if an outlet wants the power, prestige, and access enjoyed by the press they should be divorced from the seeking of profit and married to the mission of informing the public in a fair, balanced, and honestly complete manner with as little bias as professionally possible. I think that's the best way to bring integrity back to the press while preserving our 1st Amendment rights.</TEXT>

As for flavor, have you considered using flavored water or juice in place of plain water? I don't think frozen fruit being kissed by weed smoke on the way to your lungs is going to impart much flavor, and I suspect will taste pretty close to bong water by the time they're ready to be munched on...but you've got me curious.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm very pro-2A and you're not looking at this clearly. Nobody in this country should be able to purchase a firearm without first having been subjected to a background check. Period. That's just plain fucking common sense. Universal background checks do not have an effect on a gun runner selling out of the back of a van, you're right, but that's not who those laws are targeting. Universal background checks allow me, as a law abiding pro-2A enthusiast, to sell a personally owned firearm to a stranger and know that they are not a prohibited person and that I'm not unknowingly committing a felony. I think your ideas about needing a background check to let someone shoot your gun is ridiculous and literally nobody is saying that except for knee-jerk reactionaries using slippery slope arguments. As for the "arbitrary differences" between the two guns in the picture you posted; I'm actually very familiar with the Mossberg 500 as I used them both in the military and as a law enforcement officer, and you're dead wrong. The differences between those two configurations are not arbitrary and I outright refused to carry one with a pistol grip because that "accessory" makes it a less safe weapon while providing no increase in functionality. A pistol grip installed on a Mossberg 500 makes engaging and disengaging the safety impossible to do without moving one of your hands, which means you either have to keep the safety off (which is less safe), or keep the safety on and then have to adjust your grip right before firing (which is less safe). In my opinion anyone who puts a pistol grip on a mossberg is a fucking idiot who wants to endanger those around them for the sole purpose of "looking cool". There are those of us who would like to have discussions about reasonable measures that might have an effect, if you're unable to do that maybe you shouldn't participate.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; The Mossberg 500 is one example of many But it's the one *you* chose to use and I was simply stating why making that choice might call your level of intelligence on the subject into question.  gt;Pick any traditional rifle or shotgun add a pistol grip to it and it's ~~an assault weapon~~ a less safe weapon and therefore banned. FTFY There are very few legitimate reasons to add a pistol grip to a rifle or shotgun that doesn't come with one from the manufacturer (one example would be to assist a shooter with a disability), just like there's no legitimate reason to add a giant wing to the back of a stock car; but people do both because they think it looks cool...when in reality they usually look foolish to those around them. I don't care about the wings on cars much because the downside to them is their car looks stupid, I do care about questionable accessories added to firearms that make the weapon less safe because the downside to that is usually dead innocent people. Not in mass shootings, but in negligent discharge "accidents".  gt;Don't insult my intelligence In this instance I don't really have to...and couldn't if I tried.</TEXT>

If you're interested in reading about my thoughts on the subject I made a post detailing them recently [which you can find here](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralTalk/comments/7yrf42/in_the_wake_of_yet_another_school_shooting_how/?st=jf76x4g2 amp;sh=243edf3a). I agree that no amount of laws will prevent a motivated "bad guy" from carrying out their plans, but there are reasonable measures that we can put in place that will make it far more difficult for them in the future. Some people will be deterred from committing criminal acts if one of the tools that they need to acquire in order to commit them is now more difficult to obtain. Laws won't stop all crime, but they can reduce it a good amount.</TEXT>

That's not what FOX does though, FOX obtained the largest viewership of any other news network by being nearly the sole source of the conservative viewpoint.

Yes, some of his themes were ugly, especially toward women and minorities, but even today at the height of the #MeToo movement society is still ugly toward women and minorities. He's not a monster for telling these stories, he's one of the few who are telling the truth, and he has been for over 3 decades.</TEXT>

And be the face of the company And make every client happy And sell the company's products And be personally accountable for the thousands of dollars in their drawer And be trustful enough not to steal the tens to hundreds of thousands in the vault And open accounts And close accounts And deal with unreasonable customers And about a million other things that I don't know about because I've never been a bank teller. An employee's worth is far more than what their receive in compensation.  gt;The difference is that in a crunch scenario, the COO could do the teller's job. But could you promise me vice versa? I very serially doubt that the COO of any bank could step in and immediately fill the role of a teller in any bank anywhere in the world and they'd blow up at the first asshole idiot they had to deal with.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; But, in the real world, what happens if, during their work to separate privileged from unprivileged, they stumble across information related to a separate crime that is (for the sake of argument) not privileged? I was a federal LEO for 5 years and I'll answer this based on my training and experience. First things first though, there is no such thing as privileged communication about illegal activity between an attorney and their client. If the communication involved criminal activity it is by definition not privileged. Everything gathered during the execution of the search warrants on the office, home, and hotel room is legally obtained evidence (provided they stayed within the scope of the warrant during its execution of course). The "clean team" has the legal right to review all of that material obtained during the search to look for the evidence detailed in the search warrant and weed out information not pertinent to the investigation. If while looking for that evidence they "stumble upon" evidence of another crime not related to the original warrant, they are absolutely allowed to pass that evidence on to investigators who would open up a new investigation into the new charges, even if they don't involve the target of the original search. Any evidence obtained by the "clean team" during their review is legally obtained and admissible in court based on the [plain view doctrine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_view_doctrine).  gt;In the United States plain view doctrine allows an officer to seize, without a warrant, evidence and contraband that are found in plain view during a lawful observation. The doctrine is also regularly used by TSA Federal Government Officers while screening persons and property at U.S. airports.  gt;  gt;For the plain view doctrine to apply for discoveries, the three-prong Horton test requires:  gt;  gt;1. the officer to be lawfully present at the place where the evidence can be plainly viewed,  gt;2. the officer to have a lawful right of access to the object, and  gt;3. the incriminating character of the object to be  #8220;immediately apparent. #8221;  gt;  gt;In order for the officer to seize the item, the officer must have probable cause to believe the item is evidence of a crime or is contraband. The police may not move objects to get a better view. In Arizona v. Hicks, 480 U.S. 321 (1987), an officer was found to have acted unlawfully when the officer moved, without probable cause, stereo equipment to record the serial numbers (the officer was present to investigate a shooting). The plain view doctrine has also been expanded to include the sub doctrines of plain feel, plain smell, and plain hearing.[1]  gt;  gt;In Horton v. California 496 U.S. 128 (1990), the court eliminated the requirement that the discovery of evidence in plain view be inadvertent, which had led to difficulties in defining "inadvertent discovery." Now, because they are executing a search warrant, the requirement that objects not be moved to "get a better view" is nullified because the warrant gives them the ability to search anywhere that the specific evidence listed in the warrant could reasonably be contained.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; but at this point in time the Democrats are objectively the best choice Objective - adjective: 5. not influenced by personal feelings, interpretations, or prejudice; based on facts; unbiased: Subjective - adjective: 1. based on or influenced by personal feelings, tastes, or opinions: One of us is confused over the difference between the words "objective" and "subjective" and I'm pretty sure it's not me. Look, I've been a liberal Democrat my entire life because *subjectively* they have been the most logical party for me to support in the past based on my viewpoints. But that doesn't mean they have my undying support, nor do they enjoy my blind support, because *objectively* they care more about obtaining and retaining power for the Democratic Party than they do about the plight of the average American as was demonstrated during the Presidential primaries that preceded our last Presidential election. Both Clinton and Trump were *subjectively* the worst possible candidates in the history of US politics and the fact that the DNC pushed for and rallied behind a candidate that a full 50% of the population considered to be a monster shows that they weren't trying to represent The People, they were representing their own self interests. Pushing a polarizing candidate in an already divided nation is not how we get on the path to unification, it's a sure way to get to where we are now, the second most divided this country has ever been in 250 years...and the #1 time killed more Americans than all other wars fought combined. Democrats used to be the rational voice in a sea of garbage, now they're just pumping more garbage into the sea of garbage. They have become first and foremost "anti-republican", not "pro-America", and until that changes We The People will continue to lose...even if they keep winning elections. *Objectively* the Johnson/Weld ticket in the last election was the **only** one that contained two candidates who possessed the knowledge, training, skills, and experience necessary for the position they were seeking, and they received less than 5% of the total vote, so *subjectively* the voting population doesn't know what the fuck they're doing and are reliving their glory days in high school by making elections a popularity contest instead of voting for the person most suited for the position. The last election was the first time in my life that I didn't vote Democrat, and if the DNC even entertains the idea of allowing Clinton to run again in 2020 I will never vote for another Democratic candidate at any level of government for the rest of my life for they will have proven that they no longer represent the ideals that earned my support in the first place.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Yeah, I think I'll stick with a candidate who knows where Syria is. I'm betting 50% of the population couldn't point to Syria on an unlabeled map, and it was Aleppo, not Syria, *and* it was a "gotcha" question out of the blue and off topic for the interview. But don't allow me to get in the way of that giant hook and sinker you swallowed whole. If you think that was the worst answer given to a question during the campaigns, the problem is you, not Johnson.  gt;Libertarianism is a cancer for the United States. No, *actual cancer* is a cancer for the United States, but they'll never be a legitimate party with momentum until they stop using the juvenile "taxes are theft" rally cry. That doesn't mean individual Libertarians can't or shouldn't be elected though. Their ideas aren't all bad or all good, and neither are the Republican's or the Democrat's. There isn't a single political party anywhere in the world that can claim to have all the right answers, all the right policies, and all of the right people. A good mixture of all positions is absolutely required in order to govern effectively...which should be the goal.  gt;Just look at what they've done to Oklahoma's education system. Defend that statement with facts supporting it because to the best of my knowledge Republican policies are responsible for the state of affairs in Oklahoma, not libertarian ones.  gt;The Democratic Party is *objectively* the best choice right now. Their articulated policies are *objectively* the best choices for the future of America. No, once again one of us is confused about the meaning of objective and its not me. It is your *opinion* that the democratic party is the best choice, that opinion makes that choice subjective, and you only hold it because you agree with them, not necessarily because they're factually correct. I don't think very many registered Republicans would agree with your position, that disagreement renders your opinion to the subjective category.  gt;Now, please explain to me, since you're a "liberal Democrat", how Republican policies are the *objectively* better choice. I never said they were, so why would I try to explain why they are? One example I would pull out rather quickly if pressed on the subject though would be the republican position on the 2nd Amendment. It is both objectively and subjectively better than the Democrat's current position (which can't even be defined completely) since there are so many different positions on gun control being held by democrats these days ranging from doing nothing and up to and including a total gun ban and repeal of the 2nd. That's a pretty big range of opinions, meanwhile the GOP stands firm and collective in their position of "shall not be infringed". Both an objectively and subjectively better policy position, at least they're unified...at least they appear to be and appearances are almost the only thing that counts these days.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Read something awhile back that claimed it was intentional. They made more money from opening new franchises than maintaining them, so they would give locations worse and worse inspections until the store "no longer qualified" to receive supplies from their vendors which forced them to close, thus allowing a new franchise to be purchased and opened by someone else nearby. I don't have a link, but it made sense to me at the time after looking at the history of Quiznos stores in my area. They actually have decent food at a decent price but can't seem to stay open for more than a year or two.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;cops can ask anyone to do practically anything. They sure can, and so can anyone else. If a cop is asking for something, feel free to say no.  gt;And let's not forget the cute wording cops use to confuse people. Like saying "I need this or that" vs a direct order or question.  gt;  gt;Example: I need to see your license. I need you to stand over there. etc etc.. If you've been pulled over the officer **needs** to see your license. It's not a request, it's not a question, it's not optional. They actually legitimately *need* to see your license. There are also a lot of very legitimate reasons why an officer would "need" you to stand over there, whether it's for your own safety, their safety, or the safety of others around you. An officer acting within the scope of their duties will not "ask" you to do something when you have no choice in the matter (unless they're just being polite), they will tell you to do it. If you're being told to do something, there's a reason for it. I'm going to be honest and say it sounds like you've got a chip on your shoulder against cops and are choosing to listen to urban legends and people who don't know what they're talking about instead of going straight to the source. Yes, there are bad cops, but they're the exception not the rule.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Most officers either have a breathalyzer0 with them, or at least have access to one in the field via another officer. They are typically not admissible in court, but like you said they can be used to establish probable cause for an arrest where they will either have to submit to a blood test or the admissible breath test, or both. The FST's are conducted to further establish probable cause and to kill time before the breath test. Prior to giving a breath test, the officer generally has to observe the suspect for 15 minutes without them eating or drinking anything. The reason for this is to prevent the suspect from making an excuse that mouthwash or something else caused a false positive. If your swish with mouthwash or take a shot of liquor and then "blow" your results will be off the charts due to the alcohol in your mouth instead of the alcohol in your breath.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If you end up in this situation don't freak out. Physical disability is a valid excuse for both failing and refusing the FST (if the impairment is obvious). As long as you pass the breath test you should be fine unless the officer can clearly articulate why they believed they had probable cause to arrest you. The legal limit in the US is .08, but you can be arrested and convicted for DUI if you are impaired even if you're at .04 for example if the officer can articulate why they felt you were impaired. You shouldn't have anything to worry about. Enjoy your trip!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sounds like a good cop I'm glad you didn't get hemmed up for being a nice guy. The eye test is by far the best indicator if someone has been drinking. When you've been drinking, your eyes do crazy things while tracking an object that you are completely unaware of and can't prevent/stop. If your eyes do not do these things, it's unlikely that you're impaired and a "zero" on a breathalyzer quickly confirms it. You only really need to wait if you actually suspect impairment and you're anticipating an arrest. The wait time acts as evidence in your investigation and prevents the suspect from saying at trial "I blew that high because I swished with mouthwash when he pulled me over to hide the smell of alcohol, but I wasn't drunk." Waiting 15-20 minutes before administering the breath test allows everything to leave your mouth so that the test is a true measure of the alcohol in the lungs, not in the mouth.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yesterday started much like any other, but a lot had changed by the time it ended. I took the kids to school as usual, then my wife and I spent a few hours cleaning the house. I was working on May's budget when my wife noticed a missed call and a voicemail from her lawyer. My wife sustained a spinal cord injury during a surgical procedure in 2015 and she had filed a malpractice lawsuit a little over a year ago. We were in the litigation phase of the lawsuit and depositions (that had already been scheduled and rescheduled several times) were about 2 weeks away. We had been anticipating another delay but the urgency and tone in the lawyer's voice sounded more serious than that. The Dr's attorney had produced a piece of evidence a few months ago that implied that the statute of limitations for malpractice had expired before the lawsuit had been filed. In my state the statute of limitations is 1 year from the date the patient suspects malpractice; or three years from the date of injury, which ever happens first. Our attorney had warned us that the defense would likely use this piece of evidence to file a Motion for Summary Judgement to dismiss the case based on statute of limitations, and that a Judge (or jury) would make a determination based on the information contained in each side's motion. We had been expecting it but that's not what they did. What they did instead was hire an expert neurosurgeon from a big name hospital to review the case, and the expert's opinion was that the standard of care was not violated. The defense then used this opinion to file a Motion for Summary Judgement to dismiss because the standard of care was not violated. Our attorney told us that in order to even respond to the Motion they would have to hire their own expert to review the case and give an opposing opinion which would cost approx $10-15k. Our attorney told us that our case was unlikely to survive a challenge on the statute of limitations, and they were unwilling to front the cost of an expert knowing that. We were told that we could file a Motion to keep the case alive while we attempt to find new counsel or we could agree to drop the case, and that if we didn't agree to either option they would file a motion to remove themselves from the case. We were told that there was one other option though, and they went on to describe what I can only call an emotional hail Mary to the other side. Given no real other options we opted for the hail Mary, and we've been told we'll know the results of that by the end of the week. We would've been satisfied with losing after having our day in court, but our day in court was stolen from us for the cost of an expert opinion. If we could self fund this case we would ride it out to trial, and if we lost we'd lose with honor and integrity. But we can't because the malpractice insurance company that covers the defense attorney's fees is willing and able to outspend the victim to avoid a trial. This is the 8th malpractice suit against this specific surgeon, all but 2 have been dismissed based on statute of limitations, and my State's medical board has never been notified about any of them. As far as they know this surgeon has never hurt anyone. Although it had been fun "fantasy spending" one of those large malpractice judgements or settlements you hear about, I never really expected to win, I just wanted justice...but there's no justice to be had for the poor. People like us just don't come into money like that, and when they do, it typically kills them. So maybe this is a blessing in disguise. Feel free to ask me anything about malpractice and I'll do my best to answer based on my experience without disclosing private details about our case.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>My wife's attorney wants to quit her CA medical malpractice lawsuit. What are her *real* options?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-04-19 18:22:17</DATE>
    <TEXT>My wife had a spinal cord stimulator implanted in Feb 2015 and woke up from the procedure numb from the waist down. The procedure my wife had done is performed over 100k times a year in the US and to the best of my ability to search she is the only person to have ever sustained this particular injury during this procedure. She retained an attorney and filed a malpractice lawsuit in Feb 2017. The statute of limitations for malpractice in our state is 3 years from the date of the injury or 1 year from the date the injured party suspects malpractice, whichever happens sooner. My wife sat for her deposition in Nov 2017 but "tapped out" after 6 of the allotted 8 hours. During her deposition the defense produced a note from her hospital chart that was written by a nurse at the hospital (the surgeon was not employed by the hospital, they were contracted if that matters). The note said something to the effect of "Patient claims they will seek compensation for a spinal cord injury". The note blindsided my wife's attorney as they had not seen it and had no knowledge of it. Our attorneys had told us to expect the defense to use this note to file a Motion for Summary Judgement to dismiss based on the statue of limitations and if they did that a Judge or Jury would hear the motions and made a determination on whether the case can/should move forward. We had been expecting it, but that's not what they did. What they did instead was hire an expert neurosurgeon from a big name hospital to review the case, and the expert's opinion was that the standard of care was not violated. The defense then used this opinion to file a Motion for Summary Judgement to dismiss because the standard of care was not violated. Our attorney told us that in order to even respond to the Motion they would have to hire their own expert to review the case and give an opposing opinion which would cost approx $10-15k. Our attorney told us that they feel that our case was unlikely to survive a challenge on the statute of limitations, and they were unwilling to front the cost of an expert knowing that. We were told that we could file a Motion to keep the case alive while we attempt to find new counsel (they said it was incredibly unlikely that we would be able to find a lawyer willing to take the case) or we could agree to drop the case. They said that if we didn't agree to either option they would "file a motion themselves" (implying that they would request to have themselves removed from the case). We were told that there was one other option though, and they went on to describe what I can only call an emotional hail Mary to the other side. Given no real other options we opted for the hail Mary, and we've been told we'll know the results of that by the end of the week. Ours is the 9th medical malpractice lawsuit against this particular surgeon and all but two of them were dismissed based on statute of limitations problems and to my knowledge my state medical board has never been notified of any of them. If the hail Mary fails, what is our best course of action moving forward? Here are the problems that I have with the situation: * Neither my wife nor I even knew a spinal cord injury existed on the date the nurse's note was written, it was several months to a year after the surgery before we learned that. * I don't like that the defense's expert gets to decide the outcome of this case without being challenged. For all we know he's a quack who will say whatever he's paid to say, I mean he's an "expert witness"...that's kind of their job. * I don't like that the nurse's note gets to decide the outcome of this case without being challenged. Why was it put in a medical chart to begin with? Does she make notes like that often? Does her employer encourage/require her to make notes in medical charts that have no bearing on the health of the patient? * During my wife's hospital stay after the surgery almost every nurse, aide, orderly, or any other person who was **not a doctor** mentioned a lawsuit after learning of her condition. Every. Single. One. Does the hospital encourage or require them to do this so that they can chart it and start the statute of limitations clock without the victim knowing it? I don't know, because she won't have to sit for a deposition if the case goes away. * I feel that the statute of limitations violates my wife's right to due process and is an unjust law. If we drop the case do we lose standing to fight to get that law changed? * I was told that I have a lawsuit against the surgeon for "loss of consortium" because through the doctor's actions I have lost my role as husband and been forced into the role of my wife's caretaker, but it hinges on the successful completion of my wife's case. I feel that the unreasonable statute of limitations restrictions set by the State have violated my right to due process and my ability to be "made whole" from damages. * Are there any parallels between my wife's case and the other cases against this doctor that were dismissed for the same reasons? Same nurse? Same note? Etc? I want to be clear that neither of us are looking to get rich, we just want justice. If justice can be had by a big fat check then so be it, if justice means changing the law so future victims don't get blocked from seeking justice and we get nothing, that's even better. Of the three options that our attorney gave us, what is our best course of action moving forward?</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; Was the nurse or doctor who made the chart note deposed? The nurse is on the defense's list of people they want deposed, but it has not been scheduled or completed yet.  gt; Were they subpoena'd for records? Who, the nurse? The hospital records have been subpoena'd and received by both sides, that's where the defense found the note that our attorney had missed during their review. Was it missed because it wasn't there? Was it missed because it was altered? Was it missed because it didn't exist until the defense fabricated it? I don't know and it doesn't appear as if our attorney is interested in finding out.  gt; Do you have any reason to believe that the note/records are not authentic or have been modified by the defendant? I have not personally seen this particular piece of evidence with my own eyes, so I can't make a determination one way or the other. The verbiage contained in the note however, specifically "patient claims they will seek compensation" is not something that my wife would say as it falls far outside of her normal vocabulary. The note could've been paraphrased, but the words contained in the note are not words I've ever heard my wife say in 12 years of marriage.  gt; Your challenge appears to be whether your wife should have been aware of a medical malpractice claim as of February 2015 (which would make the statute of limitations February 2016). Your comment about every hospital staff member mentioning a lawsuit is interesting - have any of those people been deposed to ask what the hospital policy is on mentioning lawsuits? No. My wife is the *only* person who has been deposed, and it was not even completed. When my wife sat for her deposition, mine was scheduled for the following day, and the surgeon's for the day after that. When my wife tapped out, both mine and the doctor's were rescheduled for Dec. The doctor backed out a few weeks later and all 3 were rescheduled for the end of Jan. The doctor again backed out and they were rescheduled for Apr 25 and 26. When we got a call from our lawyer a couple of days ago, we were expecting them to tell us that the doctor backed out again...but instead they dropped this bombshell. I feel like our attorney's may have been operating in bad faith. They've told us from Day 1 that they were prepared to take this case all the way to trial if necessary, and I find it odd that they are willing to give up without a fight now that they actually have to invest money in the case in order to move forward. Our attorney's office is in Los Angeles and we live about 8 hours away in NorCal so the distance has been an extreme barrier to communication between us and I have been incredibly unsatisfied with the level of involvement we've been allowed to have in the case. My wife retained their services in Nov 2016 and since that time we've had 1 face-to-face meeting with one of the attorney's working our case (about 3 hours of prep the day before her deposition) and 2 Skype sessions with the main attorney...that's it. I'm wondering if we unknowingly got hooked up with an "ambulance chaser" who was hoping for a quick settlement instead of a lawyer seeking justice, and now we're being abandoned since the quick settlement is out the window. According to my research and conversations we've had with various attorneys, it takes victims on average 18-24 months to find representation for malpractice cases...if they can find representation at all. I feel that the requirement for victims of malpractice to find an attorney, file a suit, all while recovering from whatever injury they received in less than 12 months is absolutely unreasonable and unjust. I also feel that the limitation that an injured party must have representation to even bring a suit is unreasonable and unjust. If we had been able to file a suit and find representation during the long process of a malpractice suit this wouldn't be an issue, but the state requires injured persons to have representation before a suit can be filed, and that requirement is a barrier to justice.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's how it works here as well. Our lawyer works for "free" and fronts all of the costs of the trial. If the case wins, the lawyer gets the money they spent up front back, plus a percentage of the judgement. Our lawyer told us they are no longer willing to front the cost of the trial in light of the evidence pertaining to the statute of limitations.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;you are right that there is no justice for the poor. we see it everyday in the form of public defenders system being poorly equipped to defend those unable to afford counsel. We actually don't appear to have that problem in my area. We don't have a publicly financed public defenders office here, instead every private defense attorney that practices in this jurisdiction is on a list. If a defendant needs counsel and can't afford it, the court appoints the attorney at the top of the list and they represent them pro-bono and are moved to the bottom of the list. It seems to work ok here, but the population is less than 150k so I imagine it wouldn't work as well in more densely populated areas.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;To be fair, we don't know anything about the specifics of the case, and it's entirely possible everything was done correctly despite getting a bad outcome. This is true, but it's also the purpose of a trial. To ensure everything was done correctly and that this is just one of those instances where shit happens. I'd be satisfied if the case went to trial and lost on its own merits.  gt;Back surgeries carry a small chance of injury or damage (not to mention death), which is explained in the informed consent process. My wife's injury was not included as a possible risk on the informed consent form. In fact, to the best of my ability to search, my wife is the only person I can find who has ever sustained this particular injury during this particular procedure that is performed 100-115k times annually in the US.  gt;If this surgeon did 1000 cases in the past few years, and only the few you mentioned went poorly, that's a really good complication rate. Maybe for you it is, but I disagree. Mistakes happen, and I don't feel anyone should be made to stand accountable for making an honest mistake, but I don't believe that's what happened here. Not only did the surgeon fail to disclose the existence of the injury, when confronted about it specifically they down played it as insignificant and claimed it couldn't be responsible for her symptoms...then they discharged her as a patient. That's not a mistake in my book.  gt;It's unfortunate the surgery didn't go well, but that doesn't necessarily mean that malpractice occurred. I know, that's what a trial is for. The lawyer's representing the doctor, who are being paid by the insurance company to defend their financial interests, shouldn't be able to say "malpractice didn't occur" and have the case dismissed before trial, because of course they're going to say that, it's the only defense against malpractice. That's for a jury to decide.  gt;The USA has become far to litigious in these situations. But again, we don't have anywhere near enough information here to make judgements on the surgeon involved. I find your response to be very judgemental against my case for someone saying they don't have enough information to make judgements. I am as against frivolous lawsuits as any doctor is, but this isn't a frivolous lawsuit and it deserves to have its day in court. That's all we want.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; It takes a lot of time, money, and effort to train doctors, and we wouldn't want a couple mistakes to throw that down the drain. Really? Why not? I don't care how much time, effort, or money a person expends to get into their chosen profession, if they are incompetent, negligent, or just bad at their job, they shouldn't be doing it. Period.  gt;but honestly, people think they have a right to %100 successful healthcare, and that's just not true. You're right, it's not. But a person who can walk should be able to count on still being able to walk after a surgical procedure that had nothing to do with walking. My wife's injury was not included as a possible risk factor on the informed consent form she signed prior to the procedure.  gt;If you're going to let a doctor attempt to fix you in some way, you have to be prepared for the fact that they might fail. Correct, but you should not have to expect to come out of a surgical procedure in worse shape than you were in before it...unless it's one of those situations where shit just happens. Is this one of those situations? We don't know because the insurance company was perfectly willing to throw buckets of money at the case to make it go away...they were just unwilling to throw it at us.  gt;Unless it can be shown that they were seriously negligent, they really shouldn't be held accountable for every small mistake. I absolutely agree and I invite them to court to lay out their case where the standard of care was followed and the doctor did nothing wrong. If they can convince a jury of that then so be it, but they're able to avoid it because their bank account is bigger than mine.  gt;They do so much good, in some cases to the point of being overworked, that drowning them in litigation when a surgery doesn't go as planned is really unfair in many cases. What kind of person do you have to be to think this is in any way an appropriate thing to say to someone who can't feel their legs because "a surgery didn't go as planned"...and how fucking dare you use the word "fair". What the actual fuck is wrong with you?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Interesting read, but a couple of things I found odd based on our experience:  gt;only 16 percent of the patients diagnosed with CRPS 8 weeks after trauma had the characteristic bone scan pattern. How is anyone getting diagnosed with CRPS within 8 weeks of a trauma when "chronic pain" is defined as pain that lasts longer than 12 weeks? It took my wife several years of tests to exclude every other possible diagnosis before her doctors landed on CRPS because there was nothing left and "there's no definitive test for CRPS".  gt;In my view, the value of a three-phase bone scan in the diagnosis of CRPS is very limited. A three-phase bone scan neither makes nor excludes the diagnosis of CRPS by itself. What a cluster-fuck. Did the test ultimately help your case?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Jesus did you actually downvote my response? We spent all of 2015 looking for a lawyer and after the 40th "you have a legitimate malpractice case and we're really sorry for your situation, but we're not going to take your case" we gave up. At the end of 2016 a different neurosurgeon pulled up the MRI of my wife's spine, pointed to her injury that was clear as a bell, and said "this is absolutely indefensible in court. There is nothing that surgeon can say that would legitimately explain the existence of this injury based on the procedure that was being performed". Armed with this new information we went back on the hunt for a lawyer and after another 20-30 "sorry we won't help you's" we found our current attorney. I don't think I have it in me to keep getting doors slammed in my face and I'll just accept that there's no justice for the poor in the US. Maybe the next person this surgeon cripples will have better luck...but I won't hold my breath.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; gt;Jesus did you actually downvote my response?  gt;  gt;I did not downvote your response. I apologize for that comment. Even if you did down vote it, bringing it up solves nothing and I do appreciate the time it took for you to respond, so thank you.  gt;I understand your frustration with your current attorneys, but the issue here is that medical malpractice is very fact specific. My list of questions to you was to gauge how much discovery is still needed in this case - it sounded like there are a lot of avenues to explore, but taking depositions is expensive since there are out of pocket costs that have to be fronted by the attorney. I was a federal LEO once upon a time, so I do have experience with our justice system but that experience doesn't lend itself well to tort law, so sometimes I feel like I'm grasping at straws. You're right that there appears to be a lot of discovery that still needs to be done, and avenues to still explore, and you're also right that depositions can become quite expensive very quickly (especially since our attorney is 8 hours away and the defense attorney is 4 hours away from the jurisdiction of the suit). My frustrations are more about the fact that our attorney ensured us that they were willing to pay those costs from the start, but backed out the instant they were required to put their money where their mouth was. Isn't that a violation of some kind? We don't want a guaranteed win, we just want our day in court.  gt;That is why I said that I would get a second or third opinion. It sounds like there's discovery to be had on whether your wife really made such a statement and who noted it in her chart. It also sounds like you have at least one doctor who would be willing to make a statement that the injury was in fact due to potential malpractice. Whether the cost/benefit of taking that discovery and getting that expert report is worth it, I don't know. Hence, talk it over with your current lawyers, or get new ones. That's much easier said than it is done, but I do appreciate the advice. Thanks for your time. Of the 3 options we were given: * Drop the case * File a motion to find another attorney * Choose neither and "force" our attorney to file a motion to remove themselves Which would you personally choose if you were in my position? I've never walked away from a fight in my life and I can't bring myself to accept that walking away from this one is the best move. At the same time, I can't imagine forcing my wife to continuously allow herself to be victimized and degraded by trying to find a new lawyer. We've literally already talked to at least a hundred who all said the same thing; "you've got a case but we won't help you". This fucking sucks.</TEXT>

They are the same thing, yet you only take offense at one of them while giving a pass to the other. Employees not being paid the bare minimum, rarely perform at the bare minimum level in my experience.</TEXT>

It doesn't matter how much training or exposure you have to something, you simply do not know how you're going to react in a given situation until you're put in that situation. I've been through the boot camp you mentioned, I've received the fire fighting training, I've watched all of the Forrestal and other disaster videos, and been a part of more GQ drills than I care to count. I've also received the training this deputy received, I've watched more videos of cops dying horrifying deaths while screaming for their lives than I care to remember...and some of them I'll never forget, and I've been through active shooter drills where I did what this deputy failed to do. Here's the thing though, I don't know how I would've actually responded to an incident like the Forrestal when I was deployed, or an active shooter when I was a cop, because I was never in those situations. I would like to believe that my training would've kicked in when it was needed and I would've done my part to support the mission at hand, but I'd be willing to bet dollars to cents that the deputy in question felt exactly the same way when he woke up that morning. The shooter is wholly 100% responsible for those deaths and he, and he alone, needs to be held responsible for them. The atrocities carried out in that school that day would've occurred exactly like they did if that deputy had not been present, so how is that deputy in any way responsible for those deaths? Yes, he's a coward, but this lawsuit is based on greed and sensationalism, not justice.</TEXT>

Both of my kids have friends who "died" and they have spent the last couple of days relaxing in a hotel cut off from all contact with the world. I was notified via text, email, and automated phone call Monday morning after dropping them off at school that a critical incident drill would be taking place that day. As it turns out, the drill involved several different law enforcement agencies, a helicopter, and the "bodies" of dead kids being flown off. Today my daughter told me that her friend that "died" had to write her own eulogy and so did her parents and siblings. They read some of the ones from other "dead" students today during a darkened assembly with a spotlight illuminating a casket in the middle of the auditorium. The dead kid in question was present and of to the side dressed for a funeral. I'm not against the drill itself because it provides invaluable training to LE and school administrators, but I'm not sure how I feel about actively desensitizing our children to something like that. Nobody should have to go through that unless they have to actually go through that.</TEXT>

We couldn't find a place we could afford on our own, and our married 21 year old daughter and her husband (that she married way too young) were having financial troubles of their own, so we all moved in together. Now it's me and my wife, our daughter and her husband, our 18 year old daughter, and 17 year old son all sharing a 3 bedroom. Well yesterday I found out something that everyone who is close to my daughter already knew, but I wasn't supposed to know yet. He has told her (for the third time) that he doesn't think he loves her...again (did I mention that this is the **3rd** time he's done this? The 2nd time was 2 months before they got married) and they are separated at the moment. He's still living in my house, eating my food, and sharing a bed with my daughter...but they're separated. So he's getting all the benefits of being my son in law, without any of the responsibility that comes along with it. Why am I telling you this? Because the reality of your plan sucks. It's the right plan, but it sucks. Prepare yourself.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Owning shares of a company is nothing like a Ponzi scheme. It's not necessarily *unlike* a ponzi scene either though, with a betting component thrown in. In a ponzi scheme, the operators pay dividends to initial investors with the money brought in from secondary investors. The scheme continues until the pool of new investors dries up or too many investors cash out completely. In the stock market, companies bet initial investors that someone in the future will buy their share for more than they paid for it. And let's stop with the "stocks give you a say in how the company operates" rhetoric because the number of people who invest like that are statistically irrelevant. The initial investor then makes a bet with that "someone in the future" when they're ready to cash out that they can do the same, and the operators of the market take a vig on the bet. The betting continues, and so do the vigs, until someone loses the bet. The only thing that gives fiat currency any value is the collective confidence in its value. The only thing that gives stocks any value is the collective confidence in its value based on the existence of the company backing it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I feel this is a flawed argument. The number of people who trade stock for this purpose make it almost statistically irrelevant. In a ponzi scheme, the operator of the scheme pays dividends to initial investors with the money brought in from secondary investors, after taking a portion off the top. The scheme continues until the pool of secondary investors dries up, or too many investors cash out. In a casino, the house either makes a bet with you on whether you can beat the odds, or facilitates a bet between two (or more) people and takes a vig on the bet. This continues until the house can't cover its losses. In the stock market, the operators of the market facilitate a bet between a company and an initial investor that a secondary investor will pay them dividends in the future for their investment, and the operator takes a vig on the bet. The initial investor wins the bet when a secondary investor buys their share for more than they paid for it betting that they can do the same, and the operators take a vig on that bet. The betting continues on down the line, with the operators taking a vig on each bet, until someone loses the bet and can't sell the share...although this may never happen though.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Can someone explain to me how the stock market isn't a legal ponzi scheme with a gambling twist?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-05-04 05:48:37</DATE>
    <TEXT>If I wanted to run a ponzi scheme I would first need to come up with a product that looks real but has no real value. I would then take that worthless product [intellectual property, real property, an idea, a business, etc] and pitch it to potential initial investors based on the illusion that it has value. If my scheme works, I'll receive capital from those investors and use it to show faith in my project to secondary investors. If my scheme continues to work, I'll receive additional capital from those secondary investors, and then use that to pay divideds to the initial investors hoping that they'll reinvest them. I'll then use all of those cumulative investments to pitch my still worthless product to even more new investors. The scheme will continue until the pool of available new investors dries up, too many investors cash out, or the illusion of value placed on the product is broken. This is illegal because the product being pitched was fraudulent from the start, and there is never a real chance for investors to see a return on their investment. In a casino, the house either makes a bet with an individual on whether or not they can beat the odds, or facilitates a bet between two [or more] people and takes a percentage of the bet (a vig) for providing the opportunity. The bets continue for as long as the house is able to cover their losses or until they shut down. There's no real illusion of value, only the illusion that a person can consistently beat the odds...which ironically is mostly self imposed by the individual. This is illegal in many places due to a mixture of morality, competition with state sponsored gambling (lotto, powerball, scratches, etc), and the inability to accurately tax the money exchanging hands. In the stock market, the market facilitates a bet between a company and an initial investor, and takes a percentage (a vig) for providing the opportunity. The company bets an investor that if they buy x number of shares at $y price, that a secondary investor in the future will buy those shares for $y+?% based on how well the company performs. If the investor takes the bet they buy the shares and the company gets working capital. The investor loses the bet if they are unable to sell the shares for a profit, and wins when a secondary investor buys them for $y+z% and makes a new bet that they can do even better, and the market takes their vig on the exchange. The initial investor is told that the shares have value because x+unobtainable number of shares provide voting rights in how the company operates. Neither the company nor the initial investor really want the investor to own x+unobtainable number of shares, and in most cases it wouldn't be financially possible anyway. Also, both know up front that almost none of the secondary investors who would want to buy them in the future would be buying them in an attempt to collect x+unobtainable number, although it does happen on occasion. So because almost nobody is interested in, nor capable of purchasing, x+unobtainable number of shares in order to exercise the voting rights represented by them, those voting rights have no real value to the average person, and if the rights have no value, the stock can't have any value because it's value is based on the ability to vote in a company that is [assumingly] doing well. So with the exception of the company during stock offerings, everyone who makes a profit selling a stock is only able to profit by betting someone else that this share of stock that they own, that doesn't have any value, is worth more than what they paid for it. The bets keep going, and the vigs keep getting paid, until someone loses the bet...although that may never happen. I can't see the whole thing as anything other than an elaborate illusion. A dollar bill isn't backed by anything and only has worth due to the collective confidence in its value. A share of stock is backed by the voting rights that come with owning an unobtainable [by most standards] number of shares, and only has worth due to the collective belief in the illusion that the possession of a fraction of a percentage of an unobtainable number of shares has value. I'm not saying that the sky is falling, or that a crash is imminent, or that buying stock is a stupid thing to do. I'm simply saying/asking, at its most base form, isn't the stock market simply a casino facilitating a series of ponzi type bets on a product that has no worth? Please do not respond with a comprehensive explanation of the difference between value and worth because both are meaningless verbal judo. An Oz of gold has value because it can be used for many different things, but possessing an Oz of gold is worthless if you have no use for it and nobody is willing or able to purchase it from you. A $100 bill has no value whatsoever, but it's worth $100 because everyone agrees that it is. An unobtainable number of shares of stock has value because they provide the ability to vote in the operation of a successful company, but a single share of stock has no value and is only worth what someone else will pay for it based on speculation. Wouldn't the money collectively spent on stocks be better spent being loaned out by a credit union that the investor *actually* gets voting rights in? Companies still get the same amount of money, just from a more honest method.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No, it's really not worth more, but the illusion allows everyone to believe that it is. If you own 1 share of stock in a company, it's unlikely under most circumstances that you could walk into that company and sell it to them. They've already made their money selling it the first time, and it would cost them more to process the purchase and deal with you than the share is worth. An employee or other share holder might personally buy it from you, but not the company...because they know a single share of stock has no "real" value. So a company sells stock to raise capital. A share of stock represents a fraction of a fraction of a percent of a controlling interest in the company. A controlling interest in the company is beyond both the financial grasp and scope of the vast majority of people buying a share of stock, because it's not being purchased for the purpose of having a controlling interest, it's being purchased on the speculation that someone else will pay more for it in the future because the company spent the money it raised originally selling it responsibly, even though it's essentially worthless on its own.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm still seeing some kind of scheme or con here. Ponzi scheme: See all that heavy equipment and construction taking place on that plot of land [that I don't really own and am in no way responsible for]? That's happening with the money I got from all my Tier 1 investors, and I'm offering you lucky folks the opportunity to become Tier 2 investors! You need to act quick though, because I only have a select number of spots at this level, and if you miss it you'll have to buy in at Tier 3...which is wonderful don't get me wrong, but you really want to be at Tier 2 so don't think too mu...I mean too long about it. Act now! Stock market: See all this cool shit we're doing? We've got plans to do some shit that's gonna make this cool shit look lame, but we need some money to make it happen. Ya feel? Buy our stock during our IPO and we bet that the cool shit we do with that money is gonna make that stock go up and someone down the line is gonna buy it from you for a *huuuge* profit! The best part is, and this shit's gonna blow your fucking mind, the more money you give us per share at our IPO, the more it's going to be worth when it goes up and the more money you're going to make when you sell it. I mean seriously, look at all the cool shit we're ***already doing*** without your money, you really can't lose! So all you really need to tell us is how many shares you want, and how much you want to pay for them^^Think ^^High! . Company not paying dividends: Hey look, buy our stock cause we're doing some funky stuff over here. See, our sole reason for existence is to create profit. We do that by doing that stuff you see going on over there, it's not really sexy but it pays the bills. You know what I'm saying? Yeah, you know. So look here, what we do is we take the profits that we make, and then we don't do anything with them because then we'd have to pay taxes on them. *PointsToTemple.jpg* That means that we can then say that all that cash ***plus*** that boring bill paying crap that we do means that stock you bought is worth more! You can't make this shit up man, seriously. I mean we know it isn't because we're selling it, and if you're smart you know it isn't because we aren't paying dividends on it, but as long as there's someone out there who believes it is, it somehow is...even though it totally isn't.</TEXT>

That won't last long if every one gets sensationalized to the nth degree.  gt;Would you rather mass shootings be an accepted part of everyday life or for people to actually care about senseless violence? 1 person shot in a mall and the shooter in custody doesn't qualify as a mass shooting, nor should it qualify for national headlines without any further information. A couple of dozen people are shot in Chicago monthly, but none of them make national headlines unless a cop does the shooting.  gt;Besides, it may bother you but news stories help other people reach out. If victims were mentioned more people can donate and help. The system isn #8217;t perfect at all but stuff like this can #8217;t be swept under the rug Those stories also glorify the behavior of disturbed individuals and make them infamous in a world where nothing is more important or valuable than attention. This emboldenes and incentivizes this type of behavior and makes it look appealing to the types of people who would carry these kind of attacks out. Nearly every mass or spree killing since Columbine can be almost directly traced right back to not necessarily that attack itself, but how the media reported on the attack and the infamy gained by the attackers who I refuse to name. I didn't know any kids who died in that school that day, but some of my closest friends did. Nobody knows their names, but everyone knows the names of the people who killed them. It would be one thing if the reporting being done was for a noble purpose, but it's been perverted by profit, so if it bleeds it leads.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My wife has been taking 3,600mg/day for nearly 10 years. For the past few years it's been the only medication that she takes that's prescribed specifically for CRPS. Even at the beginning when she was titrating up she never experienced any of the crazy feelings or side effects other people have described except a few times when she drank (don't try it, it wasn't pretty). Her father was prescribed it for something else and when he went up to 200mg the way he felt drove him crazy and he stopped taking it. She doesn't understand how people are using it to get high because it doesn't do anything like that to her. It doesn't really do anything for the pain, but she says it helps with the hypersensitivity and prickly feeling.</TEXT>

There are very few pro-choice people that I've met who held the belief that a fetus is neither human nor alive. Just that the woman's right to choose trumps whatever rights are inherent to an unviable fetus, and I've never met a single person in 41 years that supported a woman's right to have an elective abortion beyond the third trimester. I believe the whole debate on this topic is stupid. Whether a person would choose to have an abortion or not is their business, and they shouldn't even be put in the position to have to voice their opinion on whether someone else should be allowed to have one.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not that I feel I owe you any justification for my life, but I resigned my commission when my wife became disabled because she needed my attention more. She sustained a spinal cord injury during 1 of the 19 surgeries she's had over the last 10 years related to her disability, and now I am employed through a state funded program as her caretaker. They figured out how many hours they would have to pay someone to care for her if she lived alone, then cut those hours in half because I'm her spouse and would do some of those things anyway, and they pay me $11/hr to do what's left over. Here's the kicker. If my wife were to designate our 18 year old daughter as her caretaker, they would pay her the full amount. It's almost as if they're trying to incentivize fraud...but I digress. So anyway, my wife is on disability and I essentially work for the state so literally every single penny of our income is provided by tax payers. Also, my wife is on Medicare and MediCaid so every penny spent on those 20 surgeries have been covered by taxpayers as well, which means unlike all you hardworking folks paying insurance premiums, we have zero medical debt even though 4 of them cost at least $125k. I don't know how much most of them cost because I never bothered looking at the statements, because I wasn't picking up the tab (infuriating, isn't it?). The best part is, we didn't even have to file bankruptcy due to medical costs associated with my wife's illness! Can you believe it?! Single payer medical coverage really is great, I honestly can't say enough good things about it. Since we didn't have to file bankruptcy, my wife's illness didn't destroy our credit so in a few more months (this is my absolute favorite part) we'll be able to qualify for a mortgage that you'll get to pay for (unless my wife dies and I can go back to work)!! Let me tell you, being poor is the absolute tits! 10/10 would recommend. In all seriousness though, stay safe out there. It's a tough job and it's easy to get jaded and complacent.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'll admit to being a little jaded. Anyone with my training and experience being paid minimum wage for the rest of their life, while listening to people say minimum wage shouldn't be high enough to support a family, would be. But I had my tongue firmly planted in my check for most of what I said in both of those comments...although everything I said was absolutely true. We found out a few days ago that our lawyer for the malpractice lawsuit that has consumed our life for the last 18 months wants to throw in the towel and quit because tort law in my state has been reformed over the years in ways that almost guarantee 90% of victims will never even see a courtroom, much less anything resembling justice. This was the 8th malpractice lawsuit filed against this surgeon, all but 2 have been dismissed based on statute of limitations issues, and the other 2 were settled in ways that ensured the state medical board wasn't notified. So this doctor had a sparkling clean record when we looked before the procedure. So to say the least, I've been in a pretty shitty mood lately. Add to that the fact that I'm sick and tired of "hard working people" shitting all over those less fortunate because it makes them feel better about their shitty lives. All that dick head knew about me was that my low income gave my daughter an incentive to get a degree, and he couldn't resist the opportunity to essentially call me a piece of shit for it for not providing for my family in the same way that he does. Fuck him. The poor aren't poor because they're lazy, they're poor because their expenses exceed their income. Period. The reasons for this very wildly, so unless you know specifically why an individual is poor, it's best to keep your opinion about why they're poor to yourself, because you don't know their situation and you don't know the road they've traveled to get to where they are.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks, I'll practice on you if you don't mind. I've spent the last 18 months educating myself on malpractice law, and what I've learned is that the system currently in place in CA is a perversion of justice. It would be one thing if it had been perverted to protect doctors from frivolous lawsuits, and to be clear that's exactly how "reform" was packaged and sold to the public 20 years ago, but in reality and in practice it has been designed to protect the malpractice insurance industry from any lawsuit what so ever, frivolous or legitimate. It's so bad that over 95% of legitimate malpractice victims (according to our lawyer) can't even find an attorney willing to take their case (because the caps on damages make them not profitable enough), and the statute of limitation expires long before they can even file a suit...because a suit cannot even be filed without representation. These are actual and legitimate victims of malpractice, not people trying to game the system and get rich, and the laws in place slam the doors of justice in their faces. I also feel it's a huge conflict of interest for the doctor's legal representation to be paid for by the malpractice insurance company that covers them. If I'm in a car accident, most people would be put off by the thought of my insurance company covering my legal defense in order to ensure that they don't have to pay a claim. The insurance company has not been charged with wrong doing in my hypothetical car accident, or in a real malpractice case, and as such they have no moral or legal obligation to seek justice. Their sole responsibility is to protect the bank account of their employer at all costs, not to defend the doctor's actions. In fact, they go out of their way to avoid having to even acknowledge the doctor's actions or the existence of the injury, much less defend them. Meanwhile, the attorney for victims of malpractice are required by law to work only on a contingency basis (no win, no pay) and cover all of the expenses related with taking a case to trial on their own. The victims themselves are prohibited by law from contributing to those expenses in any way, even if they're financially able and willing to do so. So doctors are provided with the best defense money can buy, while victims are required by law to use the best defense no money can buy. In my wife's case, there are two options available to the defense to kill this case before trial. One is a statute of limitations challenge, and the other is simply denying the existence of malpractice via an "expert opinion". The statute of limitations challenge would consist of each side submitting a motion stating their position and the judge would make a ruling one way or the other. In the other option, the defense hires an expert to review the case and give the opinion that the standard of care was not violated. They then use that opinion to file a motion for summary judgement to have the case dismissed because it's not malpractice. The victim would then get their own expert to provide an opposing opinion and file their response, and the judge makes their ruling. In my humble opinion, this is a travesty of justice because these are arguments that should be made during a trial instead of a pretrial motion because *of course* the doctor's defense is going to be that it's not malpractice. It's literally the only defense option they have available! We've been expecting a statute of limitations challenge since November, but it never happened. Instead, the defense chose to go with option #2 first, which as much as I hate to admit it was absolutely brilliant legal strategy that worked like a fucking champ. The defense hired their expert and filed their motion (their expert just happens to be employed by the hospital where this surgeon earned their degree and is a member of their board), and in order to respond to the motion our attorney has to hire their own expert. Our attorney told us that it would cost 10-15k to get an expert to review the case, and they simply aren't willing to cover that cost knowing that even if the judge ruled in our favor, a statute of limitations challenge (that they feel we're unlikely to win) would almost certainly be filed either immediately, or right before trial, since the defense attorneys are being paid by the insurance company and waiting until just before trial to file it allows them to bill their real client (the insurance company) more money since unlike our attorney they are actually being compensated for their work. I don't have 15k, but even if I could get a loan or crowd fund it, state law prohibits me from paying for the expert to keep the case alive...and I can't very well force our lawyer to against their will. Our lawyer told us that we can choose to drop the case, or have them file a motion to stay the case while we look for new representation, and if we don't choose either option they would file their own motion to petition the court to have themselves removed from the case. That's the status of tort law in CA. There is no justice to be had for the poor because they can't afford to buy it like the law requires.</TEXT>

The source of the sleeze is your obvious default position of assuming litigants are lying in order to get something you don't feel they deserve. I suspect that if I was in a car accident that caused death or injury to another, and I was arrested and charged with drunk driving that resulted in injury or death, your default position would be that I was guilty and I would have to convince you of my innocence to change your mind. I also suspect that if I woke up from a surgery paralyzed because my doctor operated on me while under the influence, and I sued him (happened in TX before you call bullshit), your default position would be that I'm lying. And even if I wasn't lying and won, you would complain that whatever I was given as a result of that judgement would be too much (regardless of the amount)...and *that's* sleazy as shit.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Glad you made it. My wife has CRPS and was on opioids for almost a decade before being taken off of them due to her marijuana use (that had been acceptable up until that point). She was terrified at first and even checked herself into outpatient rehab in order to deal with the withdrawal she assumed would be coming. The withdrawl lasted a couple of days and the rehab a couple of visits and that was 3 years ago. Once the effects of the opioids were gone, her natural unmedicated pain level dropped to lower than it was while medicated by opioids. When she was on percocet and fentynal patches her daily pain level was a 7-8, now it's a 5-6 and she doesn't take anything for CRPS except Gabapentin.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;In my experience, tramadol, oxycontin, hydrocodone, do not work for me now, but have in the past for post-surgical recovery. That makes perfect sense since all of those drugs are intended for the relief of temporary pain caused by injury, trauma, surgery, etc. They weren't designed for long term use, and the study done in the 90's that claimed that they were safe for long term use with little to no downside can't even be called a real scientific or clinical study with a straight face.  gt;For whatever is going on with me now, only methadone helps, and does not screw up the brain cell, while anti-inflammatories have no effect. I'm glad that methadone works for you. My wife tried it for about a year, but under 30mg/day had no effect on her pain and any dose over that made her look, talk, and walk like she was hammered drunk 24/7...but she couldn't tell and thought she was acting normal.  gt;Everyone is different, but if everyone jumps on the Dr. Jeff Sessions "Take 2 aspirin and tough it out" train, then we might as well just remove options from everything for everyone...'cause it works for me, therefore it *should* work for everyone.' I'm not an anti-opioid zealot and I believe that they have a legitimate use in acute pain management, and even have limited applications for the treatment of chronic pain in patients that have exhausted literally every other treatment option for their condition. I'm just sick of the highly vocal and hysterical patients who scream about their preferred drug of choice being the "only thing that works for them", and when pressed they admit that it was the first thing they tried 8-10 years ago and haven't tried anything else...and they always have a laundry list of excuses to explain why. They just want their drug in a lot of cases.  gt;Pain meds aren't likely to remove pain, just lower it to allow some functionality. Tolerance to pain works just like every other tolerance, the longer you have it, the easier it will be to function with it (*this is not true for every person or every condition). Everyone is different, and my position is mostly anecdotal based on my experience with my wife and over a decade of interacting with hundreds of people who suffer from chronic pain, but she functions just fine without pain meds of any kind even though she was adament that she couldn't survive without them when they were taken away. She's exhausted the list of available treatment options, and has a new pain management doctor that is more than willing to prescribe opioids, but she would rather live in pain than be dependent on opioids and live in that fog. It's her choice to do that now, but it wasn't when it happened, and I suspect that quite a few other people would have similar results if they were taken off them, but the fog caused by opioids can tend to cloud judgement. Edit: *added a clarifier</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Actually I'm going to disagree with you. You're correct that you shouldn't take a script to a pharmacy that you know will not fill it as written. You can't force a store to sell something they don't want to sell though. If a liquor store set a limit on the amount of alcohol they would sell to a single customer, they would be within their rights to do so (as long as the limits are applied equally to everyone), and it would be wrong to try to force a change in their policy. If you don't like it, don't shop there, that's capitalism. There is going to be a pharmacy that will be more than happy to have you as a customer and fill your scripts as written by your doctor, and it's most likely a mom and pop in my experience.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yup, I define it a little different. A small business is one headed by an owner who is passionate about their mission and puts more hours and hard work into the business than even their best employee. They genuinely value the employees that make their business possible and they care about their health and well being and pay them a fair wage that is higher than their competitors because they understand that their business is only as strong and as successful as their weakest employee. They take on risk and work their ass off and they are entitled to every dime of profit they claim for themselves, and probably more in most cases. Most places that are used as examples of small businesses in today's economy (fast food, gas stations, retail franchises, etc.) don't qualify under this definition. It is becoming increasingly popular for these business owners to buy multiple stores instead of just one because they have no interest in working their fingers to the bone like other business owners. They then take their personal share of the profits from these businesses and then use them to pay a manager to run each location, one or more district managers to oversee them, and in some cases another top level manager to oversee the district managers. Then they take a snapshot of what they have left and say "Hey look at this! I'm the business owner and I barely make any money[for not lifting a finger]! If you raise minimum wage I won't make anything and I'll have to close my store. What's better for them, the pittance I pay them, or no pay at all?" These stores operate on a skeleton crew making minimum wage, the assistant manager making $1-2 more than minimum wage, and the store manager making $3-4 above minimum wage in stores that have over $1 million in annual sales. That's not a small business, it's a sweatshop. You can take 4-5 steps into almost any business and take a look around, give a quick glance at the employees, and know almost instantly whether you're standing in a small business that is backed by a passionate owner, or a sweatshop paying the bare minimum to the only people willing to work for that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;What drugs are designed for long term pain? Most of us here have done everything else, first, and generally numerous times *before* we ever got actual pain medication. I honestly don't know that there are any pain meds that have been specifically developed for long term use, at least not any that are an opioid derivative...but I could be wrong. I hope you didn't misinterpret my last response to you, I wasn't being critical, I was just giving my view point based on my experience. I actually agreed with most of what you said. I am going to have to seriously disagree with your assessment of "most of the people here" though. I've been following this sub for years and it's populated with quite a lot of people who haven't tried anything but drugs, and have no interest in trying anything but drugs, but there are also people who have tried everything as well. It would be a stretch based on my experience to try to say that "most people here" have tried everything (at least the ones who participate in discussions on this particular topic).  gt;Pain tolerance is something that happens usually with short-term pain situations, like pain compliance techniques used by police, maybe even healing from acute injury. That's not tolerance, it's called healing. I was a cop and I've used the pain compliance techniques you're referring to and you don't become tolerant to the pain, it just stops immediately or shortly after the hold is released.  gt;With long term chronic pain, usually all that happens without intervention is you learn to adapt to your limitations and decreased capabilities, you don't have less pain. I didn't say you have less pain, I said you become tolerant to the pain, and that tolerance allows you to function with it better. Pain is absolutely subjective. What I consider to be a 5 might be a 2 to you, and what you consider a 7 could be a 10 for someone else. In the early stages of my wife's condition she considered her pain to be a 9-10 because it was the most pain she had ever experienced. Unfortunately she can no longer say that and the exact same pain she used to consider to be a 9-10 is now a 6-7 because she's experienced pain higher than that. That's tolerance to pain over time.  gt;The point is that people who do not have to *live it* every day do not know what they are talking about. Anecdotal medicine is one reason we are in this situation. The tyranny of *should* is another. I don't have a chronic pain condition, that doesn't render my opinion on the subject moot, nor does it mean that I don't suffer from and live with chronic pain every single day of my life. Pills for profit over patient welfare is why we're here, point blank. Big Pharma is 100% responsible for the state of opioids in this country. Full stop. There are 7 billion people on this planet that live outside of the United States, and they all seem able to treat their chronic illnesses with only 2% of the world's supply of opioids (because the US consumes the other 98%). That statistic alone shows that we're doing something wrong, and the answer isn't "more opioids". The tyranny of the patient toward the doctor is far more damaging than the tyranny of "should".</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You're absolutely correct. Selling medication is a choice made by a pharmacy, not a legal mandate. Because there's no legal mandate (that I'm aware of), there's no mechanism in place to force them to sell more than they're comfortable selling. My wife was recently prescribed low dose ketamine troches and a compound cream containing ketamine. The only pharmacy in our area that even stocks ketamine refused to fill the script because the pharmacist was uncomfortable with it. Instead of raising hell or trying to force them to fill it we went to the nearest pharmacy who would...even though they were over 2 hrs away in each direction, and they were more than happy to have us as a customer (no surprise that the local one is a giant chain and the one that helped was a small mom and pop). Now, if our local pharmacy was filling similar scripts to others and refusing my wife's that would be one thing, but you can't force a pharmacist to do something they're uncomfortable with. That's not how the world works, nor should it be the way the world works. If your business sells cakes, you have to sell cakes to whoever wants one, but if your business doesn't sell cakes (or only sells cakes of a certain size) you can't be forced to sell cakes that you don't offer as part of your normal business. If a pharmacy wants to limit the amount of meds they fill, your only course of action if you disagree with it is to simply vote with your dollar and spend it elsewhere. It's inconvenient, but so is possessing principles.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Why else would they allow girls? They've already fought, and lost, several battles over the ability to exclude who they want, and a challenge based on gender is a no win situation. It's more profitable to include them than it is to fight to exclude them if/when it was challenged, and I suspect a similar change from the girl scouts will occur shortly. Both organizations provide invaluable lessons to our nation's youth using vastly different methods and it's just silly (and politically incorrect) to exclude someone who is interested in learning those lessons due to the difference in the way that they pee.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm sorry that you don't understand the difference between plain old discrimination, and offensive discrimination. Every organization that has private membership practices discrimination of allowing members to participate while excluding non-members. Most of the time this is perfectly acceptable, where problems arise is when the criteria for determining membership becomes offensive. When the BSA was established, it was discriminatory for them to exclude girls...but it didn't become politically incorrect or offensive until recently in the grand scheme of things. So yes, it's discriminatory, but it hasn't been offensively discriminatory in the public's eye until very recently.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;This is the stupidest thing I've ever read. I suppose segregation wasn't "offensively discriminatory" until the 1960s either, right? Slavery was an acceptable form of discrimination for centuries (and still is in some places), it's only become offensively discriminatory in the public eye for about an eye blink in the grand scheme of things. I find segregation to be personally offensive, but I wasn't alive when it was in affect so I can't say with any certainty how I would've felt about it had I been alive at the time. I am quite certain that quite a few individual people (especially those who were segregated) found the practice offensive at the time, but individual feelings are meaningless when the topic of discussion is what's offensive in the public eye, because segregation wasn't offensive enough in the public eye to do anything about it until something was done about it. The boy scouts excluding girls is the same way: historically acceptable, until recently. I don't understand why you're getting so worked up. I believe, according to the standards of today's society, that exclusion from scouts (either branch) based on gender is wrong. I applaud the BSA for making this decision and I hope that the girl scouts will follow suit shortly. I'm starting to understand why liberals have such a bad rap. We're on the same side, probably support a lot of the same things, yet I feel like you're my adversary.</TEXT>

I assume it's some kind of insect trap, but I have no idea who put it there or what they're trying to catch. I'm guessing they're trying to get a count of how many bugs are in an area, so I'd like to know what kind of bugs.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; You don't get to have a dollar menu when you pay fast food workers $15/hr. You don't get to have  lt;$10 shirts when you pay retail workers $15/hr. You could if those places operated like legitimate small businesses, but instead they're operated like a chain of sweatshops. A small business is one that is headed up by a passionate and dedicated business owner who put more hours into the business than even their best employee. They take on risk and put their blood and sweat into the business, and they deserve every penny of profit they choose to keep for themselves...and more in most cases. That's not the reality of fast food and retail though. These budding entrepreneurs don't want to work hard for their money like other small business owners, oh no, they'd rather have their money work hard for them. So instead of starting a business they can put their everything into, they buy a handful or a dozen, or more of these types of businesses. Then, they take their share of the profits from all of these businesses and use them to pay a manager to run each store (usually a family member or family friend) because they shouldn't have to work for their money, they already have money working for them. Depending on how many of these businesses they have they'll also have 1-3 district or other top level managers overseeing all of the stores (again, usually a family member), who answer to the co-owner (typically a child or spouse). Then after paying all of these people (completely unnecessary costs for a "small business"), the owner takes a snapshot of what's left and says "See look! I barely have anything left for myself so if I paid more I'd have to close.".</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Where do I look to find out the general cost to have a new house built in my area without directly calling contractors and wasting their time?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-05-19 01:57:37</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've been watching our local real estate market for almost a year now and I've gotten a feel for what houses are going for. My wife and I are on a fixed income and we're almost ready to buy our 1st (and likely only) home. I don't really see this as an "investment" as much as I look at it as being the house I'll likely spend the rest of my life in (so I don't necessarily expect to see a return on my investment for at least 20 years, if ever). Due to our fixed income we're going to need to be relatively certain that whatever we buy will not need any significant repairs for at least 5-10 years, so we'll need something "turn key" that has already had any needed repairs already done, so that we have time to build a "major repair fund" on top of the normal "emergency fund". In our area, homes that match that condition and meet our other needs are in the $130-150/sqft range ($225-250k), but our income is only realistically going to be able to purchase something in the $85-100/sqft range ($180-200k). So where do I look to see if that's a realistic option? Ideally I'd like to price stick built and manufactured options.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; You're talking to a former small business owner rn. And a former minimum wage fast food worker. So are you, what's your point?  gt;You're making some pretty huge assumptions about how and who these places hire, and to what degree managers are necessary. From my experience working in fast food, decently paid managers are waaaay more important than minimum wage employees, and are completely necessary. These are my thoughts based on my observations while living in something like 30 different cities in 9 different states over 41 years. Sure, it's anecdotal, but it carries more weight than the anecdotal evidence of someone who has been in the same place their whole life (not saying you have, I'm just speaking generally). In my experience, a very large portion of the places I've spent the majority of my money in, have worked in, my children have worked in, and people I've known have worked in all over the country have operated like I've described; one person (or family) owning between 3-12 (or more) different stores all managed (at least at the district level and above) by family members or close family friends who pay the bare minimum to substandard employees to run substandard businesses. One gas station that I worked at saw $1.2mil in annual sales and the owner that lived 3 hrs away paid the store manager $14/hr + the use of a run down 1 bdrm shack adjacent to the store to run it. The only person willing to do that job for that pay was someone who had no businesses doing that job in the first place because she was completely over her head, but the owner didn't know it because they were only there 2-3 times/year...and couldn't figure out why the store was losing money hand over fist. Yes, managers are very necessary, important, and invaluable. And do you know who tend to make the best managers? The owners of the business who have a vested interest in the business' success (as long as they possess the aptitude to own and operate a business to begin with, and if they don't they probably shouldn't own one). You can walk into any business and take a look around the entrance (and it almost doesn't matter what kind of business it is), take a glance at the employees, and know almost instantly whether the owner of the business is "present and involved", or if you're standing in a sweat shop owned by an absentee owner paying the bare minimum to the only people willing to work for that. From my experience, the phrase "you get what you pay for" is never more true than when discussing employees. Every fast food joint, retail shop, or any other business you've ever had a bad experience at, whether it was rude staff, substandard service, messed up order, or ever bitched about for any reason almost certainly occurred at a modern day plantation where wage slaves make money for an absentee owner that does nothing but crack the whip and scream about the bottom line.  gt;Also, even if the owner of said establishments took a $25M/yr salary and paid the grunts minimum wage, there's still no problem with that. Well, I guess that depends on how you define "no problem". I consider something that is unsustainable to be a problem, if you don't that's fine. Business cannot squeeze every drop of profit out of their customers, while paying their employees pennies, and expect to continue to have customers. I'm curious what the new census will show, but the last one showed that 43% of working Americans earned $15/hr or less and I'm betting that number will be over 50% now. So half of all working Americans aren't able to purchase anything but the bare necessities, and business thinks that's sustainable? It's no longer good enough for a small business to be successful, they have to show continuous growth for their owners. It's not good enough to get a portion of the market share and generate a steady dependable income, oh no. They have to show 3-5% growth per year or they aren't seen as successful, and when the market is saturated or the income of your clients doesn't keep up with inflation, the only way to show growth is to cut costs. The easiest way to cut costs is to cut labor. You go from good employees earning a decent wage to sub-par employees earning the bare minimum. This results in a drop in clientele and a reduction in profits, which requires more cuts. The current mindset of continuous unending growth is unsustainable at best, and catastrophic at worst when it crumbles.</TEXT>

I'm going to disagree with this because I feel juries are the best format currently available from the perspective of the accused, but we could improve on the jury system currently in place. Our current system of trial by jury was designed to be used by a population and world that for all intents and purposes no longer exists. The sheer size of our population and the advancements in communication and technology that have taken place make our current system flawed and antiquated. We could easily improve upon our current system by simply increasing the number of juries that hear each case. Instead of having 12 people sit on a jury and hear a case, 3 juries of 12 people should hear each case. Each jury would deliberate independently from each other and all 3 must reach the same verdict in order to obtain a conviction.</TEXT>

As long as we continue to glorify these types of killings, and talking about the incessantly, and give attention to the killers, they will continue to happen. It's a self-fulfilling prophecy. Nearly every school shooting over the last 20 years can be almost directly traced back to not necessarily the Columbine attack itself, but how that attack was covered by the media and due to that exposure the effect it had on society and pop culture.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm a firm 2A supporter, but at the same time I'm a realist. You're right, there's really nothing that can be done about the 300 million guns already in the US, but that doesn't mean that strict gun laws won't prevent criminals from obtaining them. I'm not advocating for the following, just using it as a demonstration. Right now there are a near infinite number of guns that I can purchase legally and then sell illegally for a huge profit. The only thing really stopping me from doing that is a lack of initial investment funds and a healthy respect for the law, but other people don't have either of those two hangups. So as it currently stands, the criminals who don't follow the law, can 'lawfully' purchase a theoretically infinite number of guns from an infinite number of sources, so there are always an infinite number of guns available to be purchased cheaply by criminals who want them. If we put in a full retail gun ban tomorrow and did not allow the sale of any new weapons, the number of guns available to be purchased by criminals drops from 'infinity' to a finite number. Of course there will still be black markets and gun runners, and people will still have weapons that can be stolen, lost, or sold, but with the reduction in supply, the cost of illegal guns will put them financially out of reach for most of the low end criminals who actually use them.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2018-05-22 02:13:56</DATE>
    <TEXT>There was a comment I saw in a discussion about whether or not the left creates problems in order to create solutions to them and how the left always tries to cram acceptance down everyone's throat via legislation. Not only do I not agree with that, I think the exact opposite is true, and the comment describes it perfectly. "Conservatism is the cause of Leftism." I want to challenge the belief that the left creates the problems that they rally behind, because most of them are started by the right in response to (and as a direct attack on) people exercising individual liberty, and the left's involvement is in defense of that liberty only. A man (actually lots of different men and women) wanted to exercise their individual liberty and marry their boyfriend in order to receive the same financial, tax, and legal protections for his family that are enjoyed by the rest of Americans. The right responded by saying "Ohhhhhh no. You can't do that because we don't agree with it." and they actively took steps to prohibit it. Since there's no legal or Constitutional argument that can be made to deny marriage to these people, and "it's icky" doesn't really cut it, the left stepped up in defense of individual liberty and used the only tool available to the population (government intervention) to protect it. A transgender individual wanted to use the bathroom that they were A: More comfortable using, and B: Less likely to be physically assaulted in while using like the rest of Americans. The right responded by saying "Ohhhhh no. You can't do that because we don't agree with it." and they actively took steps to prohibit it. Since there's no legal or Constitutional argument that can be made to deny the use of a bathroom to these people, and "it's icky" doesn't really cut it, the left stepped up in defense of individual liberty and used the only tool available to the population (government intervention) to protect it. A woman who knew she was incapable of being the kind of mother that a child deserves wants to exercise her individual liberty and have an abortion, even though it kills her inside to do so. The right responds by saying "Ohhhhhh no. You can't do that because we don't agree with it." and they are actively taking steps to prohibit it. Since there's no legal or Constitutional argument that can be made to deny a medical procedure to anyone, and "it makes us sad" doesn't really cut it, the left steps up in defense of this individual liberty and uses the only tool available (government intervention) to protect it. People like to tell the left that "you can't legislate people's opinions on sex, race, violence, mental health, personal choices, or religion", but from my perspective the right are the only ones attempting to do so, and the left's actions are [mostly] in direct response to the problems being created by the right, and then subsequently and conveniently blamed on the left.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I want to bring to light how broken our legal system is in America. I know everyone "knows" it's broken, but very few understand the degree in which it's broken. My wife has been victimized by the very laws that are supposed to protect her and I want her story to be heard in an attempt to fix this broken mess. The betrayal and rage I feel right now will consume me if I let it, so I want to do something constructive with it instead. Over the last 24 hours I have reached out to my Governor, LT. Governor, State Senator, State Assemblyman, The Ellen Show, Dr Phil, my local newspaper, both local news channels, another newspaper 60 miles away, and ABC Investigative News. Who else can I send my wife's story to? I need suggestions because I don't watch TV anymore so I don't know.</TEXT>

I want my wife's story to be heard, and I want the people responsible for it to be forced to acknowledge that responsibility even though they've successfully shed their liability. I'll think on it, again thanks for the suggestion though.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have nothing but contempt and burning hatred for her lawyer so I won't be seeking out their counsel in the future. I'll take strangers on the internet every day of the week and twice on Sunday over them. I can't exactly blame you for not wanting to touch that question though haha. How about a little game of legal math surrounding the definition of "tortious interference" instead? In a world where a lawsuit is settled for $X with an NDA attached, and the annual household income of the gagged = $X+$16,000; are there any consequences to violating the NDA if the garnishable/attachable household income is $0 and the sum total of all assets owned is less than $X? Assuming no slander, libel, or any other actionable acts aside from disclosure.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Here's a funny story. I have assumed that defense counsel would be stalking our social media profiles from the start, and intentionally made all my posts public and never mentioned the case at all because of it. My wife just got a call from her [very angry] lawyer because they had just gotten off the phone with [a very livid] defense counsel. Defense counsel had seen a post very similar [to this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/answers/comments/8lty1r/who_else_can_i_tell_my_wifes_story_to) and between that, and a few other recent rants, they were very angry over the "slanderous" things that I had been saying over the last few days. They said that if I didn't stop immediately they would back out of the deal and possibly pursue legal action against me. Everything I have said is true and I have proof to back it up, and my understanding of the law from the police academy is that the truth is always an absolute defense against libel/slander. Is that correct? My wife's lawyer advised her to tell me to stop immediately, at least until the deal was done. After that both her and I could tell anyone we wanted and they wouldn't blame us. I really couldn't believe that a licensed attorney gave their client that advice, but this is the same attorney who spelled their client's name wrong in the lawsuit they filed on their behalf...and they'll have their money by then and be shielded from the consequences of violating the NDA, so what do they care. This deal allows a doctor to walk on malpractice that resulted in a spinal cord injury and partial paralysis for $29k and no report to the medical board. It gives my wife's lawyer $26k of that, and my wife gets $4k. There is a compelling piece of evidence in the case that defense counsel found during their review that can be argued shows that the statute of limitations expired a year before the lawsuit was filed. When my wife's attorney was presented with this piece of evidence they gave my wife a few options (a motion for summary judgement based on it had not yet been filed by the defense). Her options were to drop the case, authorize them to seek a low ball settlement "to put as much money in your pocket as we can", seek a new attorney "but it's going to be impossible to find one based on this piece of evidence", or they were going to quit and the case would die before ever seeing a courtroom. Even before my wife was injured I believed that the statute of limitations for malpractice in my state were unreasonable, and as such, unjust and bad law. I wanted to lose based on the statute in order to gain standing to challenge it (the statute is 12 months but it took 18 months and contacting 70-100 attorneys to find representation and another 4 months to file the suit...12 months is just unreasonable). I know that's not how it works, but being wronged by a law makes your arguments as an activist against it more compelling, but in a state of emotional turmoil my wife agreed to settle. She thought at the time that her lawyer would take sympathy on her for such a small settlement and take only enough to recoup their losses and give her the rest, instead of taking everything they were entitled to. I told her that she was foolish for thinking that because they're in the business of making money from settlements, not breaking even. Am I foolish to believe that there is no way defense counsel will pull out of a deal that literally only benefits their client and our lawyer? Am I also foolish to believe that we are pretty insulated from any action or consequence for violating the NDA since my wife is on disability and I earn minimum wage as her caretaker through a state funded program? I would be willing to make the minimum payments on $29k in the event of a judgement against me and her disability is untouchable to my understanding.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thank you for responding, I'm really just trying to have a conversation and not be an argumentative ass. I understand that standing doesn't apply and was just saying that to illustrate my point, but I do want to lobby to change the law because I firmly believe it is unjust. In order to put forth a compelling argument justifying my position I have to tell my wife's story and I want to make an as informed decision as I can before doing that.  gt;If you want to break the agreement because you think you're judgment proof, why ask for advice? To find out how correct my assumptions are, if at all. I really don't know what my exposure here would look like. I've decided to send a draft of what I plan to write to my wife's attorney, but I do not expect to receive a response from them. At least I wouldn't respond to it if I were them.  gt;Assuming you don't own a home they can get a lien on We literally just decided a few hours ago not to buy a house and continue renting for awhile.  gt;don't have any retirement savings Neither of us have a dime saved for retirement, which is something that is absolutely terrifying for someone over 40 to admit.  gt;don't ever plan to inherit any money Neither of us have any relatives that we know of that would make this something worth considering.  gt;don't plan to file suit against any other parties I can't tell the future, but I would be hard pressed to voluntarily go through this process again with the system in the broken condition its in. A broken clock may be right twice a day, but it's still broken and essentially useless.  gt;don't ever plan to work again Unless my wife passes away I will be unable to work a regular job. I've tried twice over the years and my availability just make me an undesirable employee if I'm being honest. I can't say that I blame them, I wouldn't want to employ me either.  gt;and expect your wife to outlive you so you can continue to live on her disability and your caretaking, sure, you're pretty judgment proof. Of course, life changes, as you've learned. It doesn't matter if it occurred tomorrow or 20 years from now, if my wife were to pass away I will have been out of the workforce for so long that the only thing I would be qualified to do is minimum wage jobs. I could of course work my way up over time, and possibly use it as a springboard to something better, but I've accepted that I'll likely live paycheck to paycheck until I die regardless of anything.  gt;As to truth being a defense to defamation, that's true. Except when it's not. In the post you linked, you say the other parties used the law to "victimize" your wife. Thank you for pointing this out and you're right, I need to be more careful with not only what I say, but how I say it. I've been lashing out in anger and it's regretful, but my intentions moving forward are to be rational and free of venom and accusations. I do not believe that the other party used the law to victimize my wife. I believe the law victimized my wife on its own.  gt;Based on what you've said, they offered a settlement despite being after the SOL - it's practically a gift in terms of what they had to provide. I don't really understand why the defense agreed to settle to tell the truth. I actually have a little admiration for the council for the defense because I have to admit that he is an absolutely brilliant legal strategist, and I suspect if the representation in this case had been swapped, the result would be completely different. It's no secret how any settlement would be divided, so he had to know that it would only really benefit our attorney, so I can't see him doing it out of the goodness of his heart. If he was as convinced as my wife's lawyer that the case wouldn't survive a challenge based on the statute of limitations (which was filed on the day the settlement amount was reached), I feel he had to at least suspect that when our attorney approached them with an offer to settle, they were doing so mostly as an attempt to recoup their own losses before they quit. Maybe I'm just overthinking it and I would never make any statement or accusations about either of their motivations unless I'm allowed to speculate without being slanderous.  gt;I'm sure there are a 100 other subjective things you'd say in telling your story. And land in court. If I were stick to the theme of lobbying to have the law changed by detailing my wife's story, kept to just the facts as they happened without accusations or commentary, asked everyone involved in the case to join my cause and support tort reform, all while openly admitting that I do not hold the doctor responsible for what happened and that the agreement continues to shield her from any and all liability, it would violate the NDA. Since my wife is the signatory she is the one who will be sued if it gets violated I wanted to know the full extent of her potential liability assuming no other actionable events. Is the amount of the settlement the worst it can get?</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;You're running into the limits of what online questioning with a lawyer who isn't your lawyer and doesn't have all the facts can provide. I recognize that but I appreciate you taking the time to respond anyway. I know I'm asking a lot from people who are volunteering their knowledge but I feel like I don't have many options so I really am thankful for your input. The reason I was going to disclose the nature of the settlement is because it clearly shields the doctor from any and all liability and acts as an absolute defense against any wrongdoing for what happened to my wife. I do not want to come across as vindictive and I am not trying to get my wife's case heard in the court of public opinion, so I want to be able to limit the doctor from suffering as many negative consequences as I'm able to (although I know that the potential fallout from this could be quite extensive for her) and hopefully earn her support (although I'm more likely to receive a call from Donald Trump this afternoon asking for my opinion on what he should do about N. Korea lol). I felt that holding up the agreement that we entered into voluntarily that absolves the doctor of any wrongdoing, and saying that we want to honor that portion of the agreement, was a step toward accomplishing that goal. The SOL is not the only thing that I feel is broken about the tort system and the settlement agreement itself illustrates one of the other things that I consider to be a failure of the system, so I'd really like to be able to address it if I can.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's a very fair point, thank you for pointing it out. I still maintain that as a business operating in the state, it's a law they should have been aware of at the time of the incident if they had been doing their due diligence. I don't know whether they actually were aware of it or not though. I struggled with coming to my position on this case when it initially blew up because I recognize my anti-religious bias and I didn't want that to be the deciding factor in forming my opinion, but I feel I've come to the most equitable position for everyone involved IMHO. If a [fill in the blank] offers customization services on a broad range of stock products, they can't be forced to customize them in a way that the artist finds distasteful (violating their artistic expression) or violates their faith (violating their religious freedom). In this case, the baker couldn't be forced to put 2 grooms as the topper or congratulate Adam and Steve on their nuptials, but as I understand the facts of the case the conversation never even got to that point before service for even a stock cake was refused. They also shouldn't be forced to put the picture of an aborted fetus on it, or an ISIS/KKK/Pride flag, or anything else that they don't want...but they have to sell the stock product to anyone who has the ability to pay for it. Customizing a cake utilizes an artist's skill and talent, while making a stock cake is a function of the business they operate in order to showcase (and sell) that skill and talent. This of course would still provide an out to the business who could simply deny it based on scheduling, and if the baker had done that from the beginning this would have never been an issue, but [I believe] they wanted to make a political statement instead.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was really emotional about life events and quite stoned the first time I watched it and I got totally sucked in, and the sacrifice at the end that made the first trilogy possible to begin with hit me right in the feels. It was a really great story told somewhat poorly, but it's really easy to forgive whatever flaws it may have in my opinion. I just watched TLJ for the first time yesterday and came out of it "meh" to be honest. It didn't totally suck (except for that bullshit spacewalk, what the actual fuck was that?!

    <TEXT> gt; This is where it gets into a fuzzy area where one could say "This is a celebration of homosexuality" since it was an explicitly separate event than the wedding. In the theme of playing devil's advocate, name me another industry that has a [rightful even if not necessarily legally protected] say in how, where, or by whom their products are consumed by after the transaction has been completed and the product has left their store? To me this would be like a car dealership refusing to sell me a car because I'm going to let my wife drive it if that violates their religious beliefs.  gt;Also, the guy refuses to bake cakes for Halloween, divorce parties, and even bachelor parties for religious reasons, so it's not like this is a one-time excuse for him. I believe he has a right to refuse to decorate a cake for just about any reason. He shouldn't be forced to decorate a Halloween cake, an aborted fetus cake, a KKK cake, an anti/pro-anything cake if he doesn't desire to do it for just about any reason. However, if he offers multi-tierd wedding type cakes as part of his business, he has to sell the stock/uncustomized cake to anyone with the means to pay for it and he doesn't get a say in what kind of event the cake gets consumed at. He sells cakes, so he should sell the cake. He also sells custom cakes, and he can be as discriminatory as he wants to be as to the themes he's willing to work with.  gt;He also did actually offer them a pre-made cake, rather than a custom one. They wanted a "wedding cake" he offered them a stock sheet cake, which nobody in that industry would refer to as a "wedding cake" with a straight face.</TEXT>

That's true, but I feel that if you're going to challenge the legality of a law via civil disobedience, you have to be willing to accept the consequences of violating that law because it's "valid" until it's changed.  gt;I think it's fair to say that most of us wouldn't feel comfortable being compelled to make cakes for meth dealers, or for serial murderers, or a celebration of one's thousandth successful shoplifting. I also think it's fair to say that if a meth dealer, serial murderer, or avid shoplifter came into a shop with money to spend, and didn't ask that what they're buying endorse anything, that they should be served just like every other customer.  gt;You misunderstand then -- he did offer them a stock, undecorated cake, or for any other cakes within the store He offered them any item for sale in his store but refused to provide a cake that in any way resembled a "wedding cake", which is what they wanted to purchase. He shouldn't have to customize the cake in a way that endorses the union, but a stock uncustomized wedding cake does not do that. It just gets eaten like all of the other things he makes.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;So, hypothetical argument here -- a state imposes a law that says you must own a slave. You don't agree with slavery, and you believe that the constitution is on your side, so you refuse. I appreciate the mental exercise, but I feel that's a poor hypothetical to use because it's so obviously unconstitutional on its face. Let's use a more realistic one instead; the mandate to purchase health insurance. If you don't agree with the mandate, and you believe that the constitution is on your side, you can [and should] refuse to comply if you so desire. When I said that you have to be willing to accept the consequences of that choice, I meant it as a warning because law enforcement and [for the most part] the criminal/civil justice system will operate as if it's a valid and enforceable law, until it isn't. If you can't weather the storm, you have to seriously decide if going out into it alone is worth it.  gt; gt; it's "valid" until it's changed  gt;  gt;Debatable. 16 American Juruisprudence 2d,  #167; 177 says: Thanks for sharing that, I hadn't read that before and rather enjoyed it! TIL  gt;Ergo, a law that one strongly suggests to be unconstitutional should be ignored flatly, and refused at every opportunity. I absolutely agree.  gt;The decoration is the speech, and that speech would have had to be compelled for him to make the cake as he desired. I find it important for us to define exactly what we mean by "decoration" in this situation. I would consider [this cake](http://www.margusriga.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/custom-wedding-cake-toppers-funny.jpg) and [this cake](http://www.genesisdiamonds.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/fountain-wedding-cake.jpg) to be speech as you're using the word, and I would agree that forcing a baker to make either of those cakes in a style they find distasteful or violates their religious beliefs would be compelled speech and unconstitutional. On the other hand, I consider [this cake](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/65/49/13/654913ccc1ceaa2aae7c8fbefe8ffc4c.jpg) and [this cake](http://assets.marthastewartweddings.com/styles/wmax-1500/d22/wendy-kromer-mwd109354/wendy-kromer-mwd109354_sq.jpg?itok=ypMRyXRN) to be generic "wedding cakes" and as such do not constitute speech and should be sold to anyone who has the ability to pay for it, provided it's something offered by the bakery. For example, if a bakery offered [this style cake](http://www.genesisdiamonds.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/fountain-wedding-cake.jpg), but the baker didn't approve of gay marriage, I would be ok with forcing the bakery to sell that style cake without the initials and toppers, but not ok with forcing the baker to add them in a style they find distasteful or would violate their religious beliefs. I believe that the Constitution provides the baker the absolute right to both religious freedom and freedom of expression and he shouldn't be forced to make a "gay" wedding cake, but I don't believe it extends that right to the bakery owned by the baker (and if it does, I don't believe it should) and the bakery can be compelled to sell a "wedding cake" for a gay wedding if the customer can pay for it.</TEXT>

To me that gives even less legitimacy to the religious argument. I can understand religious opposition to making a custom wedding cake for a homosexual wedding ceremony/reception, but that arguement loses some of its valitity when it's just for a "celebration of homosexuality".

    <TEXT> gt; A photographer can choose to not photograph things they find offensive. A video production company can decline shooting porn. Photography is an interesting example because it plays into the existing topic. I agree that someone who advertises their services as a wedding photographer should not be forced to shoot boudoir or porn shoots against their will, but I do believe they should have to provide services for any type of wedding regardless of the photographer's personal feelings about the wedding, even if it's a mock wedding for a guy or girl and their car/horse/dog/etc. A video production company that specializes in music videos has to shoot the bluegrass or gospel video even if the owner/operators are atheist. I side with the baker and don't feel he should be forced to make a ["gay themed" cake](http://www.evethenovel.com/mypix/weddings/Gay_Wedding_Cake.jpg), or a [distasteful cake](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/67/Wedding_cake_topper_found_in_Plauen_im_Vogtland.jpg) against his will, but he has to sell a ["wedding cake"](https://equallywed.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/RBI-wedding-cakes-gay-weddings-blue-white-flowers-conceptual-design.jpg) to anyone who wants one and for any occasion they want, even if they're only buying it to let it sit in the sun and rot. The baker doesn't get a say. If he offered to sell the "wedding cake" and they refused it, I have misunderstood a vital fact of this case since 2012 (there have been several of these types of cases and I may have crossed facts with them maybe), but that doesn't really change my position on the subject, only my opinion on the validity of this particular case.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; Also worth noting that he's apparently been weathering this storm for some time. My wife and I have been involved in a civil suit for the last 19 months that just ended last week and with the amount of stress it has caused to our lives I really empathize with everyone involved with this case. These last 6 years must have been absolutely brutal for all involved and that was the reason for my warning. I doubt very seriously that either party suspected that this would engulf their lives like it has when they took their first step into the storm.  gt;A fair point, and I guess it's worth noting that all we're doing here is drawing lines in random places. That's true, but that's the point of the law, to act as society's line in the sand. Society will allow you to kill someone in certain situations, but the laws concerning murder, manslaughter, et all act as the line in the sand. The line I feel serves society best was demonstrated with my examples. The line I draw in the sand concerning abortion is when the fetus develops brainwaves that match those of a human being (between 22-26 weeks). I hate the abortion debate because I feel my position on abortion is my own, and yours is your own, and neither of us should even be put in a position where we're asked to give our opinion on whether someone else should be allowed to have one or not. It shouldn't have to be either specifically legalized or specifically outlawed in a code of law, it's a medical procedure.  gt;So, what if he's the only baker employed here? I don't think the bakery has standing to determine who eats the cakes it sells, where they get eaten at, or what is being celebrated as they're being eaten. As the sole baker in the bakery, he would have to make and sell the "generic wedding cake" to anyone, but he shouldn't be forced to create a themed cake celebrating homosexuality against his will.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; the chief justice makes the point in the decision that because he would not make a same-sex wedding cake for any customer, whether they were gay or straight, this refusal is not a refusal based on the customer, but a refusal of the message. If [this is an example](https://elegantevententertainment.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/gay-wedding-cake.jpg) of the type same-sex wedding cake being discussed I would have to agree. If [this were an example](https://salemnet.vo.llnwd.net/media/cms/RT/25667-wedding-cake-facebook.800w.tn.jpg) of the type of same-sex wedding cake being discussed I would have to disagree. I can accept that he would not make the example 1 cake for any customer, but I cannot accept that he would not make the example 2 cake for any other customer. Since he would make the example 2 cake for any other customer, I feel he should make the cake for any customer that wants it and can pay for it. It's my understanding that he refused to make even the example 2 cake, if that's correct I feel the suit is justified and the baker is in the wrong. If I'm mistaken and the example 2 cake was offered and it was refused, I don't feel the suit has merit even if it would have been an inferior cake (but not intentionally "botched") made by another employee of the bakery.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;The president has always saluted service members, to include those of allied nations. [Nope, sorry, but no they haven't.](https://taskandpurpose.com/sorry-presidential-salute-isnt-real-thing/)  gt; #160;There #8217;s no regulation that stipulates presidents must salute the troops. In fact, for the first 192 years of our republic, it didn #8217;t happen. None of the first 38 commanders in chief did it. And some of those dudes had some serious military experience. Eisenhower? Grant? I mean, Teddy Roosevelt was a war hero. Surely he felt compelled to click his heels together and cut a perfect knife-handed salute when he passed a uniform service member, right? Wrong. It was literally something that Ronald Reagan made up one day. I'm older than the practice of Presidents rendering military salutes is, and I'm not that old.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; Question: how many people actually rely on their minimum wage career to support their family? I married a woman with 4 kids while on active duty in the military. Took my honorable a year later and accepted a federal LE job. Then my wife became disabled 5 years later and I now earn minimum wage as her caretaker. So I do. I sure do wish I had dedicated something like 15 years of my life to learning skills and gaining experience that would "earn" me the right to receive a wage sufficient to provide for my family though.

I'm pretty liberal, but I've never defended MS-13 and I have never heard a liberal that I know in real life defend MS-13. What I have heard is people decrying the use of the word "animal" to describe human beings, regardless of the color of their skin or crime they may have committed. Dehumanizing gang members, drug addicts, the homeless, and other undesirables is what allows atrocities to be committed against them and go unnoticed because nobody cares about the fate of "animals".

The difference between what you want to do, and what this business owner did is really quite simple. You want to deny service to all of the people who were born black. Not because of anything they did, just because they had the *nerve* to be born a different color than you (hypothetically of course). Not a single one of them chose to be black (not saying they wouldn't have made that choice if they could have), they just happened to have black parents and their skin color was completely out of their control. This owner denied service to an individual woman who chose to accept a highly visible position within our government, and then chose to lie to the American people while performing the functions of that position.

I can agree with that, but I also feel that thinking that you have the moral high ground while sinking to their level in opposition to them is a stupid view. The thing that makes the 'good guys' the good guys are their morals and their actions, not their words. If you can treat the members of a gang the same way that the members of the gang treats society, you share the same morals as the gang...not society, you just have different targets.  gt;You can be of the opinion that there should be a just trial while still thinking the people on trial are despicable and deserve to be called names. They should be defended as law requires, doesn't mean you need to have ant respect for them as people. If you don't respect them as people, what's the point of a trial? You don't put rabid animals on trial, you simply put them down. I'm all for punishing these people to the fullest extent of the law, but that can be done while preserving their dignity and humanity. Even though they may not deserve it, society owes it to itself *not* to sink to their level.</TEXT>

If I learned anything during my years in law enforcement it's that you can write a ticket to and/or arrest literally every person you talk to if you look hard or long enough and I would be willing to bet every dollar I'll make for the rest of my life that you (and everyone you know) break laws daily that you face no consequences for. But that's really irrelevant isn't it, because those are just "soft laws" and not "important ones" like the ones gangs commit, right? Anyway, moving on...  gt;If anyone here is just as bad as ms13 it's you for comparing violent evil criminals to a law abiding person which downplays how truly inhuman they are. No, I'm saying that if you dehumanize them and/or are comfortable doing to them (or allowing others to do to them) what they do to the public, you have the same morals as the gang not the public. You and the gang just have different targets.  gt;Why do you have so much concern over how people describe ms13? How is that a priority at all here? Maybe you have other reasons for defending them? Again, I'm not defending MS-13 *at all*. I'm defending the humanity and dignity that comes with being a human being in a civilized society.

I didn't mean to imply that you wanted that. This conversation started by discussing why I got upset over Trump referring to them as animals. That's the dehumanizing I'm referring to.  gt;What laws do you think I break everyday that is anywhere near equivalent to killing and raping? There's no equivalence. A broken law is a broken law. There are levels of severity, but pointing to someone else breaking a worse law doesn't allow you to break a lesser one.  gt;I'm not dehumanizing anyone, they dehumanized themselves. You haven't said anything during this conversation that was dehumanizing, but you were defending the position of those who have. So I've tailored my responses with the assumption that you were OK with them being referred to as animals, even if you were only playing devil's advocate. I wasn't trying to personally attack you, just exchanging ideas. I hope you didn't take anything I've said personally.  gt;There is no dignity or humanity to being a member of ms13 That may be true, but if our response to them isn't firm and decisive, yet dignified and humane at the same time, we're no better than they are...we just happen to be in control.</TEXT>

They shouldn't be forced to use their artistic talent to create something they find personally offensive or immoral, but making a generic wedding cake for a customer is neither personally offensive nor immoral...it's the whole purposes of running a business that makes and sells wedding cakes.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; This cake thing is bullshit. I agree. I think it's bullshit that people have been forced to take legal action in order to convince a business that they should provide the same services to them that they offer to everyone else.  gt; I really don't know why you would want your cake made by someone who doesn't want your money. Thats the very first thing that comes to my mind. That's because you're looking at this single isolated incident instead of the big picture.  gt; I mean why not find someone who appreciates your business? Why the fuck do you want to support a business you have to bring to court to STILL be told they won't be making your damn cake? There isn't a shortage of bakers out there. See there's your problem as I see it. You've obviously never lived somewhere where there was literally only one option available for a specific good or service. This case is a big deal because we aren't discussing whether a bakery has the right to refuse service to gays based on the baker's religious beliefs (or for whatever other reason), it's about whether businesses in general *should* have that right. If we allow one business (a bakery) to discriminate, we must allow all businesses to discriminate, otherwise our discrimination laws are themselves discriminatory.  gt; A private business should be allowed to (and can) reject someone they don't like. They can't be forced to serve. Private property and all that. Technically they are hurting their own business by turning away customers and making a political statement, but if thats what they want to do, then its their right to do it. I agree that a private business should be allowed to reject someone they don't like based on actions, words, or choices made by that particular individual (like Sarah Sanders), but I don't feel that a private business should be allowed to refuse service to a specific group of people when inclusion in that group is something that's beyond their control (e.g. age, race, sex, nationality, or place of origin). For what it's worth, I do not feel that religion meets that threshold because religious beliefs, and as such inclusion in the member groups, are 100% voluntary. As an example, I would totally support a restaurant that refused service to Christians (or any other flavor of religion) because being a member of the Christian faith is voluntary, but I would not support a restaurant that refused service to all blacks because being black is not voluntary.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; They're attempting to monetize free speech on the internet. I can't speak to this because I'm not German, I don't live in Germany, and I know less than nothing about this new law aside from the memes its created itself. But I do know that if I took a copyrighted image and used it improperly, I wouldn't have "free speech" to stand on as a defense.  gt;You might as well be asking a sexual assault victim why they didn't "dress differently, so they wouldn't get noticed by predators." Go tell Terry Crews he just needs to stop working out and having a good personality, so he won't get assaulted by producers  amp; agents. This is an absolute ridiculous comparison that I won't dignify with a response and you should be ashamed of yourself. Are you freaking serious?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Bunk Bed Mission Impossible</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-07-07 03:24:26</DATE>
    <TEXT>So my wife and kids left for the next 6 days and I have more time than things to do while they're gone (I know, I know, rough life). I've been staring at these bed frames for the last week or so trying to come up with something to do with them because I'm tired of looking at them but I don't really want to get rid of them either. I bought these beds 12 years ago when I married my wife and ever since then they have faithfully held the children that I now consider my own as they slept. Now that they have [mostly] graduated to adulthood (and adult beds!) I'd like to find a way to repurpose the wood in a way that allows it to continue to support my family. The mission I've given myself (and hidden from the family) is to create a couple of chairs or small benches to surprise them with when they get back next week. The only problem is that I'm an electronics guy and the only woodworking experience I have is watching my Dad tinker in his garage when I was a kid. Anyone feel like helping me figure out what I can build [with all of this stuff?](http://imgur.com/gallery/dgeK0bt) I am far more interested in function over form and whatever I make will be mostly used in a garage, not outside for what is worth. Here's what I have (all measurements are actual): 4 - 1x5x75 6 - 1x7x75 12 - 1x7x31 10 - 1x7x29 2 - 1x9x32 9 - 3/4x3.5x38.5 (unstained support slats) 8 - 1x1x37 (bracing) I'm assuming this is all pine.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; This one could have been made better but it was turned down twice by dems. This is intellectually dishonest. If I come to you with a deal that contains terms that I know from the beginning that you absolutely will not agree to under any circumstances, and you refuse to make the deal, would I be lying if I told a 3rd party "Yeah I tried to make a deal, but /u/f3l1x said no"? No, I wouldn't necessarily be lying, but I wouldn't be telling the truth either. The Dems were never included in creating these bills, so they cannot be blamed for them failing to pass. The job of our elected officials (regardless of political flavor) is to draft legislation that can pass, because drafting legislation that cannot pass is quite literally wasting tax payer money. They are not paid to just cram whatever they want into bills and then blame the other side when it fails. It doesn't work like that. They're paid to draft legislation that can pass. Period.  gt;Would also be good to remove children from dangerous adults, parents or not, right? The difference between me and you is that you think crossing a line without permission makes someone dangerous, and I know that our immigration laws give asylum seekers 1 year from their date of entry into the country to legally claim asylum...and those laws say nothing about where or how they should enter the country, only that a person must be standing on American soil in order to legally request asylum. To me there is a very clear and distinct difference between someone who clandestinely sneaks across a border, avoids detection, and enters the country without anyone knowing, and someone who illegally crosses the border and immediately, or as soon as reasonably possible, presents themselves to border security or law enforcement seeking asylum. Trump's zero tolerance policy treats them exactly the same, and his EO treats their children exactly the same.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Using the example in your OP I'll explain a little better.  gt;Say foreign steel was $1000 a ton. American Steel was $1200 a ton. a 25% tariff means that the foreign steel now costs $1250 a ton. Even with the tariff, foreign steel is still $1000/ton because that's what the foreign company is charging for it. When an American company buys 1 ton of foreign steel, the US gov charges that foreign company the 25% tariff on the transaction, bringing the total up to the $1250 you mentioned. Now I'm going to go on a little bit of a tangent, but it'll come full circle. When you go to the store and buy a $5 item, the government charges the store a sales tax (we'll say it's 10% for the sake of easy math). The sales tax is charged to the store, not the customer, because it's a "sale's tax" and they're the one selling something. The store, being unhappy with this situation, turns around and passes that charge on to the customer, bringing the total of your transaction up to $5.50. To be clear, the government does not levy a sale's tax against customers because it's not a "purchase tax", it's levied against the business as a "sale's tax", but we all know that the business does not pay it, we do. That all being said, when the foreign company gets the bill for the tariff, they're going to add it to the price that the American company pays for the steel. They're still only charging $1000/ton for the steel, but the American company is paying $1250 to cover the company's tax debt. Since the American company now has to pay more for the steel that they need, they're going to have to charge more for the things they make with the steel in order to recover that expense. No business on Earth is going to eat the cost of a tax or tariff, ever, or at least as long as they're able to legally pass those costs onto consumers. So the answer to your main question of "Who is paying the 25%?" is you are. Except that by the time it trickles all the way down to you, it'll probably be closer to 35-40%.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I am a beginning woodworker in Northern California and I live about 30 miles from the Carr Fire. For those who don't know, over the last week the Carr Fire has been burning near Redding, CA which is 2-3 hours north of Sacramento. As of Aug 1st at 7am the Carr Fire has burned 115,538 acres (over 177 square miles) and is only 35% contained. At least 6 people have lost their lives either from the fire itself, or while fighting the fire, and it's now threatening new communities as it moves west. Over 1,018 homes have been destroyed, and 181 others have been damaged. 12 Commercial structures and 435 other structures have been destroyed, and more than 70 others damaged. #160;Some of the destruction is unbelievable, even to me. I've lived in NorCal for over a decade, and at one time was even an LEO and wildland fire investigator for the Forest Service in the area I live (and is now literally burning). Fires in the past never really phased me, but this one has me pretty rattled even though there have been others that were literally closer to home in the past that didn't make me blink. As I'm sure most of you can understand, the thought of over 1,000 families losing everything is devastating to me and I want to do something to help. After a lot of thought I came up with something that I think would make a difference, at least to some, and I want to know if it's realistic. As I've been slowly entering woodworking, I've been trying to decide what I want to get out of it before getting into it so as not to waste a bunch of time and money 'trying them all' as I go. I've decided that what I want to get out of woodworking can be most easily obtained making furniture, but not just any furniture. I would like to build quality (but low cost) furniture for low income people with a focus on children's bedroom furniture. I'm hoping that I can then sell them on CL and FB for the cost of building another one. Since this will be a hobby of mine at the moment, and my fulfillment will come from the creation itself, I see no reason to charge for my time right now because I have a near infinite supply of 'free time'as it is and would literally give them away if I could continue to build them on my own. This brings me to my idea, and the purpose of this post. I would like to build basic dressers and twin bed frames to donate to the child victims of the Carr Fire and their families. I am not asking for donations or anything like that, but looking for "free kids furniture plans" online is like looking for a needle in a pile of needles in a mine field. Can anyone point me toward some plans that will suit my purposes, can be completed with a minimum amount of tools, can be built [mostly] by one person, who also has a minimum skill set but a passion for meticulous precise work? I'll worry about trying to fund this project locally, but what are the things involving my plan that I may not have thought of? Am I being unrealistic?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Who determines what the quality of life of the patient is? My wife suffers from CRPS and during the 8 years she was on heavy doses of fentynal and percocet she would have sworn on any and everything that she needed them and without them her quality of life would be drastically reduced. She was unaware of how her medicated behavior negatively impacted the quality of life of her children or her husband. She was unaware of how her medicated behavior threatened the safety of her children by driving with them while impaired (while thinking and feeling she was sober). She was unaware of how the drugs she desperately claimed were the only thing that gave her any quality of life at all, were in fact stealing what quality of life her horrible disease left her with. She was just...unaware, of everything. 7 days after being taken of them against her will, her unmedicated pain level dropped to a level below what her medicated pain level had been for the previous 8 years. She now enjoys ACTUAL quality of life and even when she fell and dislocated her elbow and broke her arm, she hated taking the painkillers because she'd rather be in pain than live in that fog again. I agree with the sign, but I disagree with allowing the patient to determine on their own what their current medicated quality of life is, because they have been impaired for so long they haven't felt sobriety for years, or even decades. You wouldn't take the word of an alcoholic about how alcohol improves their quality of life, and you shouldn't take the word of someone who has been on opioids literally every day for years either...for much the same reason. Dependence is dependence, and while chronic pain patients may not qualify as addicts, they do qualify as dependent, and you can't trust the word of a dependent person on the subject of the item they're dependent on. You just can't. Sorry, but it's true.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I knew this post would be controversial, and so far it's sitting at -4 and has received 3 responses. One of them (yours) reasoned and logical, and the other two filled with emotionally charged gibberish.  gt;As pain patients we rely on our doctors, nurses, family and friends to speak up on our behalf if our behavior is negatively affected by the medications. I've been subbed here for quite some time, and it has been my experience during that time that the people who are most active here (or at least the ones I've interacted with), and in real life, steadfastly refuse to listen to those people you listed who they should rely on when they do speak up because "I know my body better than anyone and I'm not gonna listen to anyone tell me different! I. Want. My. Drugs! I. NEED. MY. DRUGS!!". We literally don't give anyone anything when they demand it like chronic pain patients demand opioids, because 10 times out of 10 they are demanding something that they believe will help them when in fact it's hurting them and they can't see it, but those patients making the demands think *they* should be the exception.  gt;I think we all deserve to have our basic needs met. I absolutely agree and I would like to urge all chronic pain patients to check to see if their state has a program similar to CA's [IHSS program](http://www.cdss.ca.gov/In-Home-Supportive-Services) and see if they qualify. I am currently employed as my wife's caretaker and earn money for meeting her needs. Every little bit helps.  gt;I #8217;m not trying to be argumentative, but as someone who lives with chronic pain, I want to still have pain on opioids but I want to be able to get out of bed and pee without assistance, and that #8217;s what opioids do for me. I totally get that, and I agree that opiods have a place in the long-term treatment of chronic pain. I do not agree that that the appropriate place for them is every 2-4 hours every day until you die, unless people have already begun preparing for your death in one way or another. This will probably get long, but I'm going to explain my position. If you have been on opioids for longer than 7 days, and/or it has been more than 7 days since you've gone at least 3 days without any opioids, your opinion on your level of impairment while on opioids is less credible than a literal toddler's take on the Iran Nuclear Deal. Both are equally useless because the toddler doesn't know what Iran, Nukes, or a Deal is, and you don't know how sobriety feels. When you are impaired, and it doesn't matter what substance has impaired you, you judge your level of impairment by comparing what you're experiencing in that moment to what is "normal". If what you're experiencing doesn't jive with what's "normal" you think "woah...I'm pretty messed up". The problem with long-term opioid use where an individual is taking a dose every 2-4 hours, every day, is that the further away from the last day of sobriety you get, you lose sight of what "normal" is. More accurately, your level of impairment becomes your new "normal" by which to judge experiences. How does any chronic pain patient know that their opioids don't cause impairment? Because they judge their level of impairment against their "normal", and their normal is based on how they felt yesterday, last week, last month, all the way back to day 1. So let me ask these question to anyone who is upset over anything I've said: * How impaired are you on opioids? * How do you know what your level of impairment is? * How far back is your Day 1? and for those who take them as prescribed every 2-4 hours and then drive with their children in the car: Are you comfortable with the fact that with your actions you are literally saying that you would rather your children die in a car accident than drive sober? For those that *think* you *are* driving sober, [I've been trained to catch you](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_sobriety_testing), and you can't beat the HGN test which accurately assesses 88% of impaired drivers. Have a loved one try it on you sometime.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A chronic pain patient will tell you they are not impaired because of their tolerance. They believe that they've been taking them for so long that their tolerance causes them to need a higher dose to feel the "high" from them that others get, so they don't believe they're impaired. They don't believe they're impaired because they don't "feel" high. They are experiencing their "normal" and impairment doesn't feel "normal". A person with a high tolerance to alcohol may need to get to a BAC of .15 in order to overcome their tolerance and "feel" drunk, but they are still impaired at .08 just like everyone else...they just don't believe it because of 'muh tolerence'. To be very clear, there is a difference between being sober, being impaired, and being high. Just because you don't feel high doesn't mean you aren't impaired.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[CA] Is my wife entitled to an itemized expense report from her attorney detailing litigation costs billed for her medical malpractice case in CA?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-08-11 01:12:24</DATE>
    <TEXT>[I have](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/69uc5f/how_strict_are_ca_courts_when_it_comes_to/?st=jkoj9tyj amp;sh=57aa4d68) posted [to this sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8dfwvf/my_wifes_attorney_wants_to_quit_her_ca_medical/?st=jkoj7oe1 amp;sh=4e99dac5) about [my wife's case](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8lvc46/can_someone_explain_exactly_who_this_language/?st=jkoj70au amp;sh=42657dac) a few times in that past, and although I may have come across as obstinate at times, I've been really thankful for the assistance I've received here each time. Here's the short version of my wife's story: She woke up from spinal cord surgery numb from the waist down in Feb 2015. A malpractice lawsuit was filed in CA in Feb 2017. In Nov 2017 during my wife's deposition, defense produced a piece of evidence that called the statute of limitations into question. On Apr 17, 2018 my wife's attorney told her that although the defense had not filed a motion to dismiss yet, they believed one would be filed imminently, and they were going to quit the case due to the piece of evidence unless she authorized them to seek a low ball settlement. Both my wife and I were confident that a challenge on the statute would fail due to the statute clock being stopped based on fraud/concealment on the doctor's part concerning the injury, but even if the motion was successful we'd be satisfied with the result. My wife was told that if she didn't allow the settlement, they would withdraw their representation and her case would die before the motion to dismiss had been filed, or could be answered if it had. She gave the authorization at the end of the conversation, although under extreme emotional duress (she was flip flopping between sobbing and rage) and without taking time to consider her options. On May 14, 2018 the defense filed their motion to dismiss based on the statute On May 24, 2018 that low ball settlement was reached for the "nuisance amount" of $29,999.99. Throughout the lawsuit my wife was aware that Medicare would be coming after her for money in the event that she was awarded damages, and their demand at the beginning of the case was over $27,000 (the dollar amount contained in the document linked below is one example of many incorrect details contained within the paperwork generated by her attorney's throughout the case). After the settlement amount had been reached, my wife's attorney negotiated the amount down to $3,727.47 and began the process of requesting a waiver. On July 6, 2018 my wife received [this document](https://imgur.com/a/BNjGiya) from her attorney detailing the disbursement of the settlement, and the "total due client" amount of $2,832.86 was deposited into her checking account. Her attorney also submitted the proper paperwork to Medicare in order to request a waiver of the reduced demand amount (with interest accruing throughout the process). Since then my wife has contacted Medicare 2-3 times a week, never going more than 4 days without calling, checking on the status of her waiver because she was told the first time she called that her caseworker would be notified every time she called, and people who call often tend to get faster responses. During that same time, her attorney (who had told her would be calling to check on the status regularly because of the "squeaky wheel" effect) called to check on the status of the waiver exactly zero times (according to Medicare who logs every call). During almost every single one of those calls, the agent helping her would remark about the large amount of money her lawyer claimed in litigation expenses and make a comment about how unusual it was for an attorney to take so much from a client from such a low settlement amount. One of them told her that he had been working in the waiver dept for over 20 years and her's was the 3rd most inflated expense report he'd ever seen. He then proceeded to spend 1.5 hours on the phone with her going over the expense report her lawyer had submitted with the waiver line by line as best he could. He highlighted charges like $500 to a car service for a ride from the hotel to the airport while her lawyer was in town for her deposition. Three different hotel room charges in the same day (the cheapest being $175/night) for 1 person to take an overnight trip for her deposition. Multiple charges (5 or 6) to a private company for medical image retrieval at $1,900 each (all of which my wife obtained and provided to her attorney free of charge). She was advised by him that when she received a copy of it to go through it very carefully and challenge any charges she disagreed with. Today my wife received a letter from Medicare saying that her waiver had been granted and her case was closed. She faxed a copy of the letter to her attorney who then deposited the remaining $3,727.47 into her checking account and essentially said their business was concluded. My wife asked when she would receive an itemized expense report and was told that the disbursement document she received in July was the only one she would be getting. Now I firmly believe that personal injury lawyers working on a contingency basis should be fairly compensated for their services, but I refuse to accept that 78% of the entire settlement amount equals fair compensation. I also refuse to accept that a law office can bill their client $11,439.67 without having to prove to their client that those litigation costs are actually legit. What can she do, if anything?</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; That said, if there were a lot of medical records and multiple depositions were held, $11k in costs is not all that outrageous Only half of one deposition was completed during the entire process, only 1 overnight trip for 1 lawyer took place, not a single court appearance occured, no motions filed aside from the initial complaint, and my wife was never once in the same room with the lawyer representing her, but yes there were quite a lot of medical records involved. I'm here because I can't trust my objectivity and I want to ensure I actually am correct in thinking that this is potentially a case of excessive billing and not just me being vindictive.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've been supporting and discussing full drug legalization for years and this is the first time I've encountered the licensing aspect, so this is unique, but ultimately ineffectual in my opinion. Here's why I support it, and how I would implement it if I had the power to do so. The country didn't stop drinking alcohol when prohibition went into effect, they simply stopped drinking "legal" alcohol, because prohibition ignores the very bedrock of capitalism; the law of supply and demand. As long as there is a demand for something, someone will be willing to supply it for a price...no matter what. It's just a fact. The war on drugs ignores this fact and pretends that the demand will go away if the supply is reduced. It's ridiculous on its face. During prohibition there were a lot of people trying with varying degrees of success to make alcohol, and through the manufacturing, distribution, and consumption channels they killed a lot of people because * They didn't know what they were doing * They had no oversight * They had no incentive to put out a safe product (as long as the product was consumed some distance away) * They had no legal "protection" so resorted to mob tactics It took this country less than 13 years to realize that prohibition was simply bad policy, but here we are 80 years deep into the war on drugs and they're still killing people for the exact same reasons. With the exception of irresponsible use, do you know why people don't go blind, crazy, or die from drinking alcohol anymore? Because when they buy a bottle of their favorite flavor of poison, they know without question that it will be the exact strength, the exact flavor, and the exact purity it was the last time they bought it because the alcohol industry isn't controlled by a morally bankrupt criminal organization, it's controlled by a regulated and legitimate corporation answerable to its customers, shareholders, regulatory authorities, and government. In a world where drugs are legal, you shouldn't need a license to do drugs anymore than you need a license to buy a 6 pack of beer. A person should be able to purchase a "personal use quantity" of whatever mind altering chemical they choose. As far as what constitutes a personal use quantity; what limits do we put on how much alcohol an individual is allowed to purchase? We shouldn't be trying to control access, only the "activities" that are acceptable to do while under the effects of them. You are essentially considered weird if you live in the US and don't consume alcohol, but at the same time you are absolutely shunned socially if you do certain activities while under the influence of alcohol. Drugs should be no different, and society would be a lot better off in my opinion if they were fully legalized than it is via prohibition.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes I do because I've taken the time to learn what they're about. They aren't about Satan, they aren't about worshiping the devil, and someone else has already told you exactly what they're about but you're too dense to understand it. The fact that you think that they are shows just how little effort you've put into this. I mean if you just enjoy being a hateful idiot, by all means don't let me stop you, but if you are tired of being scared and angry all the time, the answer to that lies in books. Read some and educate yourself.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>CNN was playing at work on the day Hillary announced her candidacy and I remember quite vividly how very clear CNN was that day in announcing that Clinton already possessed enough Superdelegate votes to secure the nomination. This was literally on Day 1 of her campaign. People are saying elsewhere in this post that this system is supposed to prevent a "democratic Trump", but it almost gave us exactly that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I tend to agree. Like the electoral college, I feel Superdelegates serve a good purpose, but neither are currently being utilized efficiently. If Superdelegates are going to be a thing, I feel that their identities, or at a minimum their vote, should be kept confidential until they actually cast their vote. I don't think they should be allowed to publicly endorse a candidate or disclose who they're voting for before they actually cast their vote.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think you might be confused about the meaning of proud.  gt;I'm proud of my friend's achievements, despite only providing moral support. I'm proud of my football teams wins, despite not contributing in any manner. Being happy about/for something, and having pride for that thing are not the same. I suspect you're happy for your friend and your football team, but you aren't really "proud" of those things.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Right. I just wanted to address the pride issue because you used it. I think loving all of those things are good, but having pride in those things when you didn't directly contribute to them can cause problems. I don't think the way you feel is problematic so I just wanted to address your usage of the word pride.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I often wonder where the US would be today if he had picked literally anyone else as a running mate. As a lifelong liberal Democrat I had absolutely no reservations about voting for him for President when he announced and I didn't even consider another candidate until I realized how unfit for VP Palin really was. I firmly believe picking her as his running mate cost him the Presidency...and rightfully so in my opinion because making a choice that poor should disqualify someone for that office.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; Have you ever even heard a single song of hers other than what #8217;s on the radio? Why would I do that if I haven't heard a single song of hers on the radio that I liked? Do you regularly seek out music from artists you decidedly don't like just to make sure you still don't like them?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Talent isn't judged by what's digitally mastered, autotuned, and perfected for mass consumption. Talent is picking up a microphone and singing naturally, and I've seen her do it more than a couple of times, and I've yet to see her do it in a way that earns her her reputation. Just because someone is popular and famous, doesn't make them talented. I can't stand Lady Gaga's music, but she's infinitely more talented vocally than Ariana and would be a better fit musically to memorialize Aretha. I'm not picking on Ariana because I think it'll make me look cool, I'm picking on her because I think she's a talentless hack that sings through her nose.</TEXT>
