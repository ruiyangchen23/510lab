    <TEXT>Your title needs help. See all that space after the word "bundle?" You are missing vital key words to make your listing stand out in searches. Add keywords for each item in the bundle until you run out of characters. Remain honest in your title and description of course but think about what someone searching would put into the search box.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Uh, yea don't do that. If you mark it as paid you're obligated to send it. If you don't send it he could open an item not as described or even received case against you. He would win. Fyi you should have just cancelled the bid. The guy was nice enough to message you before auction end. Not many buyers do that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I like to support smaller businesses but you have alot of competition for t-shirts. Between Woot t-shirts, six dollar shirts and others the tshirt market at least for me is pretty much covered. When you can get shirts for half of your price it's going to have to sell me on quality. What tshirt blank do you use?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yea, I'd second using myfitnesspal (mfp). As an aside I think you're being too aggressive with your weight loss. I had similar stats. 6'2 and 250 pounds on Dec. 21, '15. I set mine to a pound a week of loss and exercise on top of that to act as a "bonus" for the calorie deficit. My goal is 2100 calories which is doable. I'm now 230 pounds and still going. Best of luck.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Question about "healthy" weight loss</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-01-31 19:59:43</DATE>
    <TEXT>32M 6'"1 SW:250 CW:230 GW:200 Desk Job with jogging/walking habit (thanks Fitbit!). So someone noticed that I lost some weight. I love that! When he asked how much I told him 20 lbs (9.072kg). He then said I looked good but just be careful not to drop too much weight too fast. I've dropped the weight in 6 weeks using myfitnesspal, Fitbit and c25k. This got me thinking. How much weight loss is too much too soon? And what makes it unhealthy? Just a note, I feel great! I don't feel hungry because I focus on protein and veggies. My calorie goal in mfp to lose one pound (0.45kg) a week is 2100 calories. I've been meeting that goal and using exercise as a "bonus" to my deficit. I don't eat beyond my calorie goal unless the deficit gets over -800 calories just to make sure I'm not starving myself. Is this dangerous? Eta: changed my brain fart conversions.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Hocking Hills, Ohio- Winter Hiking</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-02-15 04:20:05</DATE>
    <TEXT>Went out to Hocking Hills for some hiking with a buddy of mine. Had a great time there. I never thought that flatland Ohio would have some hidden gems like Old Man's Cave or Ash Cave. Only been in Ohio for about 8 years but I'm surprised I didn't know much about these places. I'm sure it's gorgeous in the summer, I just went in the winter. The paths were VERY icy though. If you have a chance you should check it out. We hiked around Ash Cave a bit then did the hike from Cedar Falls to Old Man's cave and back. My video summary of the hike: https://youtu.be/DCvYYj6ZqhM Anyone have any experience in the area? Is camping allowed within Hocking Hills State park? I think an overnight would be fun there.</TEXT>

Warbonnet says to only do the underside. That DID NOT work at all. Leaked like a sieve when I tested it out. I let it dry out and did the top side and that worked well.</TEXT>

I went on to say that as the years have gone on I gained respect for him and I'm now proud that he was/is our president. (This is from memory). I had just gotten back from an amazing trip in the smoky mountains, saw our two options for president, saw he named a national monument in Maine, saw he was getting heat for it and felt patriotic. Thus, the letter I sent. :)</TEXT>

Not too hot or cold. There are adequate water sources even with the drought but be aware that you should full up whenever you see a source. We carried 2 liters and were fine.

    <TEXT>I don't have a specific hammock in mind but I would suggest getting a longer hammock (11 ft) rather than the standard 10 ft. You most likely will feel more comfortable and be able to get a flatter lay. If you buy a no net hammock then you can get a mosquito sock/net later but it won't "attach" to your existing hammock and you'll need a ridgeline to keep it off your face. I would suggest watching a ton of YouTube videos about the basics of hammock hanging. Shugemery (Shug) on YouTube has a great series for beginners. And he's hilarious. I'm personally not a fan of bear butt hammocks. Seems like they've had a huge marketing push recently. I like hobo hammocks better (on Amazon). But neither are 11 feet I think.</TEXT>

I still plan on doing it if I'm going somewhere there may not be good hanging tree so I can go to the ground (gasp) if I need to. You stay plenty warm as long as you're on the pad.</TEXT>
