    <TEXT>I just noticed that Red Barrels' twitter just unpinned the Outlast 2's release date. And I think it's because they wanted to leave a space for the trailer which is coming VERY SOON. I'M EXCITED AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA ps.i messed up the title, i was gonna type "Outlast 2 trailer may be coming today, or tomorrow, or this week."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think this is a site from Red Barrels for hinting the story. My theory is that, according to the site, the person who's created this site is Knoth's daughter or son. He/She made the site to expose Murkoff. And...I think he/she know Jessica ( https://themurkoffreport.tumblr.com/post/159324904674/remember-how-mama-used-to-call-you-her-little )(you can see "Jessica" at the right bottom) Or maybe, the person who's created this site is Jessica herself It seems he/she know a lot about Murkoff. What do you think?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Morse code in "Pills"?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-11-04 09:22:47</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've been listening to the album for a while. I have just noticed that there's a sound like "morse code" in the song. The morse code is played through out the song. ( but you can hear it cleary at 4:32 from the full EP visual vid https://youtu.be/kU7LF5mYZkw?t=4m32s ) Is it really morse code?(I might just overthink it) If it is..then is it just joji playing with the sample? or he's trying to tell us something? ps.this is my first post i'm sorry if there's a mistake!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I looked this [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/visualnovels/comments/71z0i9/doki_doki_literature_club_has_more_to_it_than_we) up again today, and I have just found out at the bottom of the thread that Dan has confirmed that his next project is unrelated to DDLC. You can check it out [here](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/362514886301057024/372759594877059072/dan.png), in case you are too lazy to check that thread haha. Or you can check it yourself in the discord room. It's true. What do you guy think? I don't know if any of you has already known about it but I didn't see anyone mentioned this before so that's why I have this thread. If the next game is really unrelated to DDLC, well... I respect what Dan and the gang are doing but I was expecting to see more DDLC. Even though I have got to be with Monika forever but I still want to see more of this game. And with The Game Theory's videos (uh any hater here?), It got me super excited to see more of this project. If the project is related to DDLC, it means the game isn't ended yet. It makes me feel happy. I don't know how to put this into words but knowing that the next project may not be related to DDLC really made me feel sad. It made me feel like I've lost *someone*. I must say I'm a bit disappointed if it's true, but hey, I'm still looking forward it! What ever it is, it must be awesome! ps. The "next" project may be unrelated but that doesn't mean the "future" projectS won't be related to DDLC, right? I still have a hope!</TEXT>

Since she's self aware, what's her perspective like when we're doing her route? Like, *who* does she talking to? The player or mc? In the preview it seems that she's talking to the player but I want to know what it would be after this. Can you tell us more about this?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Science here. When an object has so much mass and has increased its density, it can bend space-time and make what we perceive as "gravity." So, I think that's the reason why MC is literally **attractive** to girls. Because he's a dense piece of shit and bend space-time itself and he has created the huge amount of gravity and attract all the dokis. God damn it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hmm.. I'm sorry but I'm not sure what you you mean ahaha. I have no knowledge about music theory. If you mean it sounds like coming from a radio, or like from an old TV, I just used a plugin in FL12 called Fruity Parametric EQ 2 and then I chose a preset "radio" This way, it will make the sound feel like it's coming from a distance like you said. It will feel more "lofi" I hope this is the one you asked for! I'm sorry if it wasn't cleared. This is my first time making music ahaha.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Marvin seems really important in the game. Rainer even made it for him. So I don't think that there's no "Marvin" in the word table. Otherwise, Rainer just hate him so much that he didn't want to put Marvin's name in it haha.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>To be fair, the reason they ban alchahol isn't mainly because it's the King's birthday. But it's because there's an important day in Buddhist that happens to be around the same time as the King's birthday. And what do we do in this important day? Ban alchahol. (It's somewhat traditional that we have been doing to prevent car accident since there's a lot of people will go home and see their family on this day.)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>If we try reverse the videos, we may get some more hint?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-08-02 14:09:45</DATE>
    <TEXT>I have seen somebody tried to reverse some of Petscop video but it seems like there's not many people interested in that. Now, we know that some of videos can be synced with the same movement. But what if we try to *reverse* some of the video and see if some of them can be synced together? Because the game might not directly replay the movement, but it might reverse the movement input and then play it, for some reason. As we can see in Petscop, there's something about "opposite" going on here. There's literally a window in the game and the quitter room with *reversed* layout. Someone has also pointed out that the calendar has the opposite controling button. Edit: [here] (https://www.reddit.com/r/Petscop/comments/93akqg/anyone_notice_that_the_calendar_arrow_buttons_are/?utm_source=reddit-android) Also, remember what tool said something about "You can't *go back* in time."? But we can see Paul traveling in different time of the frozen house. ("This is the frozen house, captured 3 times, exactly as it was.") This is just some idea that popped into my mind. I hope that we might find something! It may be not, but who knows! Edit: u/doomsayer706 has reversed some of the videos in comment. Let's see if we can find anything!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Paul is developing the game without knowing. Just like Tiara. The game uses their input and texture editor. This way, the game is always developing because it's a "growing organism."</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-08-20 16:27:27</DATE>
    <TEXT>So far from what we have seen. The game can **record** the player's input and display it. And from Tiara/Bell, we can use the Nifty cheat code to **edit** the game's content. That means the player is a part of the game. Without rewriting the CD-R, you can always develop the game. In that way, the game is ALWAYS growing, and developing through the players' actions. The more you play, the more the game has learnt and developed. ["It's a growing organism."](https://i.imgur.com/eyO4sYs.png) Edit: Tiara/Bell might already be aware of this since they are literally the one who told Pall about the Nifty. But might know about this after some time of spending time playing this game. (In Petscop 12 we can see Tiara/Bell had been trying to play the game. Then, in Petscop 15 we can see that they have surpassed the game and know how to manupulate the game directly.) Edit2: Formatting.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If this is true, I think I'm starting to know what's the moral of Petscop. Everything is because of your own action. This game just reflect your action. Remember Quitter's room mirror? And demo sequence thing? Everything Paul, and us are doing right now are what making this game a game. Rainer just want to reflect the players' action, including their past.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah this is what I was aware of, too. It's like editing rather than developing like you said. But, still, it was something I thought that's worth to be pointed out. Anyway, **editing** the game *might* be **developing** if we look at it from Rainer's perception, right? In my theory, if one of the purpose of Petscop is to record the players' input action and need the player to edit the game in order to proceed, and the editing will be left there, continue being exited over and over. Being developed over and over. But, still, it still needs the memory card and technically counts as editing the game anyway. But who knows, right?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>~~Hello intrigued~~ Absolutely!  #8203; As you can see, the "DEMO" in the game showed Paul's movement and actions, basically it shows Paul's input. What Paul does in the game, the button he put, will be shown in the demo sequence. His action in the game will be shown in the demo sequence.  #8203; Now, in Petscop 14 we can see that the game showed Paul's conversation he had in the past. It showed his action in real life! That means the game is basically a demo of his life for us to see. And maybe not just his life, but other players as well (like Tiara/Bell for example.)  #8203; This tied up with [my last theory.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Petscop/comments/98u19p/paul_is_developing_the_game_without_knowing_just/) The game is always growing and developing through players' **action**.  #8203; *It's a growing organism.*</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's what I think, too. Since it seems Wavey is taking care of **Randice.** Randice might somehow be a representative of Mike, the dead kid whom I assumed that he's Rainer's brother. The reason why I think Randice is Mike, or someone else who's related to Mike, is that Randice and Toneth are friends. Roneth is also *Toneth's baby half-****brother.*** I think there's something going on here. I might make a post about this later.</TEXT>
