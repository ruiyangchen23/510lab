    <TEXT>So about a year ago I weighed 245 pounds, I lost a lot pretty quick but am having a suuuper hard time getting lower than this. Partially motivation, partially because it physically feels like it #8217;s more difficult to lose at this point. My brother is very low body fat, so I doubt it #8217;s a body type thing. What do?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Tired of Gf treating me like shit</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-04-30 09:26:04</DATE>
    <TEXT>I don #8217;t know if this is the place for this. I literally looked up  #8220;rant #8221; and found this. Sorry if not. I #8217;m just sick of this. My gf and I met while she was dating a different dude named Brett. Brett treated her like SHIT, and was generally a whiny, emo and just awful guy. When they broke up, she talked about what a terrible person he was and how he was a huge regret. Cut to a few months later. This girl and I are dating now, after she and Brett broke up. She begins hanging out with her different ex, some huge stoner named Luke. She starts posting pictures of him with hearts and love on her snapchat, lost our  #8220;best friend #8221; status, and starts asking me, and I quote,  #8220;what counts as cheating? #8221;. She eventually catches wind that I #8217;m upset, makes it my fault, and agrees to stop talking to him but in a hussy fit. A few months go by. Spring break this year. This girl gets drunk af, and calls me to come and get her. I do, trying to do the right thing. She starts rambling in my car all about how the last time she was really happy, it was with Brett. She apologizes, and I don #8217;t harp on it. I #8217;m already used to being treated kinda like garbage at this point in that regard. I see her hanging out with Brett again. I ask in a hella respectful manner if she still has feelings for him, and if she wants to break up and be with him. She says that no, she was just hanging out with him as a 1 time thing to study music. Oh well then, whatever. Thennnnn once again I see them hanging out. Then again. And again. And I #8217;m so fucking tired of being used like this. She makes me happy, she really does. But she really doesn #8217;t give a fuck about me, and I #8217;m so sick of it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Controversial opinion; always, always, ALWAYS go Doran #8217;s shield/Resolve tree runes. It #8217;s so, so important for urgot not to get behind, as much of his damage comes from his passive which increases at certain points of leveling up. So it #8217;s way more important to survive to mid game, when you have some tank items, than it is to play aggro and get fed.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I once knew a kid named orange It was a weird name But I mean my name was McLeod So who was I to judge Orange was a kid who got mad Like, lots. Orange got mad at menial things, nowhere near getting mad about. Orange would spiral and spiral, then wonder why they had to pick up the pieces, a salvage Orange was a pretty lonely kid Pretty shy, pretty content to keep to themselves Orange and I just played Pokemon all day, we kept to ourselves and we got along fine. I like to think so. Orange liked to read a lot So Did I. We read Goosebumps, we read Calvin and Hobbes. We learned everything. Everything we needed to. Orange was a funny kid. I like to think so. Orange was an...odd kid. The kind of kid you have no hope of understanding their head, and looking back, I have no clue what they were thinking either. I always thought I would by now. Orange...what an imagination Orange had different little lives they lived with each show they liked, each book, each character and game and comic. Orange never really made friends. But I did. I moved on. I grew up some. I don #8217;t know if they did. But who am I to judge</TEXT>
