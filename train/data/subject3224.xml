Disable the auto\-supply. A echelon with only one T\-doll\(HG recommended\) and no dummy. Sometimes you will need to terminate the mission to level up with least time and resources. Retreating a echelon without heliport or HQ will cost all the ammo and ration on it. And you can't retreat a echelon when it is the only echelon on map. That's when the "spare echelon" comes up. Deploy your "spare echelon" and retreat your main team for least resources lost. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ **Advised T\-doll production recipes:** Resources ordered by **Manpower** **Ammunition** **Rations** **Spare Parts** * **430 430 430 230** Target: SMG #12289;AR #12289;RF Advised for begining * **130 430 430 230/030 430 430 230** Target: AR and a bit of SMG * **430 130 430 230/430 030 430 230** Target:RF and a bit of AR/SMG * **430 430 130 230/430 430 030 230** Target:SMG Not adivsed.

I hope to find a job around salt lake city because where I work now is paying low, everyone speaks Spanish and is a really small city. I joined this program to experience United States and practice English or at least bring some dollars home. But my situation right now doesn't fit any of my desire. Sorry for my poor English and thank you for providing any info about available works. (I tried Amazon but they don't want short term employees)</TEXT>
