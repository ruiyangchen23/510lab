    <TEXT>A woman will still look pregnant after giving birth. It takes time for a woman #8217;s uterus to shrink back down. We also tend to become swollen after giving birth and that also takes time to go away. Your skin is very elastic and will, most of the time, go back to normal/almost normal within a few months. Some women will have saggy skin if they were pregnant with multiples or were very skinny before becoming pregnant since skin stretching too quickly isn #8217;t able to recover as well as skin that has been stretched out slowly over time. Every woman is different. My stomach never went back to normal, but my sister #8217;s stomach looked exactly like it did before she became pregnant.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m actually a woman. And no, I don #8217;t give a shit about karma. Here comes a pretty crazy concept: I like certain subreddits. I browse them. I make posts trying to contribute and guess what? Some people like them and some people don #8217;t. You #8217;re wasting energy on me, but I gotta say I like all this name calling. You #8217;ve called me a slut, a whore, and a bitch and you don #8217;t even know my first name yet. I #8217;m starting to swoon  #128525;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If someone wants to sleep with a bunch of people, that #8217;s their prerogative. I don #8217;t have a problem with any sexual acts as long as **all** parties involved are **consenting** **adults**. Slut it up. But bragging about fucking married men is disgusting and I #8217;ll shame you all day long. If the wife is fine with it, go for it, but if it #8217;s done in secret because the wife *isn #8217;t* fine with it, that makes you a total piece of shit. The husband too.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>TIFU by cussing at an old lady in the women #8217;s locker room at my now former gym.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-07-26 02:43:40</DATE>
    <TEXT>I #8217;ll try to keep this as short as possible while also providing enough background information. This also happened yesterday, not today. I have chronic pain and I swim in the pool at the gym for about an hour and a half every day. It #8217;s like a spiritual experience for me. I #8217;m in significantly less pain and I can just exist and be calm. An older woman at the gym has been a pain in my ass since I started swimming there. She has complained to staff that I take too many towels (even though there is a literal wall of towels, hand towels, and wash cloths by the locker rooms), has accused me of stealing her flip flops (we have a similar pair and she forgot she didn #8217;t wear that pair that day), has talked to staff about me not putting my flip flops completely under the bleacher (they stuck out about two inches) which obviously is a tripping hazard, and has confronted me about being young and disrespectful (I #8217;m 30) and about how I dress indecently (I have large breasts and I always make sure my bathing suits have full coverage so I don #8217;t know what the fuck she #8217;s talking about.) The list just goes on and on. From my first encounter with her I realized she wasn #8217;t completely mentally sound and so I #8217;ve always tried to be very polite to her and non-confrontational. I stopped being polite when I noticed it agitated her and I didn #8217;t want her to think I was mocking her so I started ignoring her completely. I even started swimming in the early afternoon instead of morning so I could avoid her and then she started coming in the afternoons. I #8217;ve talked to one of the managers and they said they haven #8217;t had any other complaints about her and she isn #8217;t  #8220;technically #8221; doing anything wrong. I said I feel like I #8217;m being harassed and they basically just repeated that she isn #8217;t technically doing anything wrong. Other people have witnessed her actions towards me, but that doesn #8217;t seem to matter. I looked into going to a different gym but price and location wise, this gym is perfect for me. So I #8217;ve been having a rough few weeks pain wise which has led to me being irritable. Haven #8217;t been able to sleep much which obviously adds to my irritability. I went to the gym yesterday afternoon and sure enough, the pool nazi came in about halfway through my swim and started giving me the stink eye. I ignored her, finished my swim, and made my way into the locker room. She followed and came in as I was getting my shower caddy out of my locker. She gasps and says,  #8220;You can #8217;t have that in here! That #8217;s disgusting! #8221; I was confused as hell and looked at my caddy and back to her. She then informed me that she is going to go tell management that I brought a  #8220;marital aid #8221; to the gym and that I obviously planned on using it in the shower. [This](https://imgur.com/a/lX8nYGG) is what she saw. My hairbrush was upside down in my caddy so the handle was sticking up and she thought it was a dildo/vibrator. I laughed and pulled it out of the caddy and told her it was my hairbrush and she said,  #8220;I bet you think you #8217;re funny, huh, Missy? #8221; I #8217;ve never done anything to this woman and I #8217;d just fucking had enough. I said  #8220;Why don #8217;t you go fuck yourself while I #8217;m fucking myself in the shower? #8221; She gasped one of this overdramatic self-entitled gasps and I said  #8220;That #8217;s right, you fucking crazy bitch. #8221; Everything happened pretty quickly after that. One of the staff was giving a tour on the other side of the locker room and heard everything. The pool nazi started crying and people were coming to comfort her. I ended up in an office, being informed that my kind of behavior isn #8217;t appropriate for their business and that I #8217;m not longer allowed back at that gym or at their facility across town. But hey you guys, they were nice enough to not charge me for breaking my contract. Even though I didn #8217;t break it. Was it trashy to cuss at an old woman? Yep. I don #8217;t cuss in public even if I think I #8217;m alone. I #8217;d just had enough of her shit. Now I can #8217;t go to my favorite gym and I made a complete ass out of myself (totally my own fault, I know.) When I left, the pool nazi was sitting in a chair with her towels wrapped around her, talking to two staff members and 4 other people I regularly see working out there. She was still crying. TL;DR An old woman at my gym has been giving me shit for months now. I finally told her to fuck off and now I #8217;m banned from my favorite gym.</TEXT>

I wear a one piece that completely covers my breasts because they #8217;re large and I #8217;m always trying to make sure I don #8217;t draw attention to them. I told her I was sorry if I had offended her because that wasn #8217;t my intention. I mentioned that my suit has more coverage that most of the people Ive seen in the pools, that I swim like this around my own daughter, and that id never be inappropriate around children. Then I walked off and I could hear her scoffing behind me.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[IN] Pool Nazi continues to harass me. Turns out she #8217;s the mother of the pedophile who molested me while I was in elementary school.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-07-31 21:04:46</DATE>
    <TEXT>Here is a [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/91xlim/tifu_by_cussing_at_an_old_lady_in_the_womens/?st=JKA2G1BZ amp;sh=4029db9b) to a post I submitted to r/TIFU describing an incident that occurred last week where I got banned from my gym for finally losing my temper with the older woman (Pool Nazi) who has been harassing me for months and cursing at her in the locker room. I found out yesterday that she is the mother of the pedophile who was my choir teacher in fifth and sixth grade and molested me for those two years. There is a very popular clinic near my house where people go for cosmetic procedures like vein treatments, Botox, etc. I go there for laser tattoo removal. I went to my appointment yesterday and after signing out, I stepped back into the waiting room to make my way back to my car. There was Pool Nazi in the waiting room. She looked confused at first and then smiled. A nurse behind me called her name so I moved out of the doorway and that #8217;s when I noticed the man she was with was my old choir teacher. She walked past me and didn #8217;t say anything. That piece of shit walked past me, touched my shoulder, and said  #8220;Excuse me, dear. #8221; To anyone who witnessed the interaction, it looked like a perfectly pleasant/normal exchange. I literally threw up bile into my mouth. I immediately went out to my car to look him up on white pages. I found him and sure enough, there was Pool Nazi listed under the  #8220;related to #8221; section. I knew her last name was the same as his, but it #8217;s a common surname so I never thought about it. I was so upset that I forgot when my next appointment was and I couldn #8217;t find the card, so I called the clinic back today and asked. The receptionist said that my grandmother had called and said I needed to cancel my appointment. I #8217;m 30 years old, both of my grandmothers are dead, and I wouldn #8217;t need someone else to cancel my appointment for me anyway. This place schedules people out months in advance. I had my appointment scheduled for 12 weeks away and because I lost that appointment, I now have to wait 14 weeks. Who else would have done something so petty it if it wasn #8217;t Pool Nazi? A lot of people on r/TIFU suggested suing Pool Nazi, but I didn #8217;t get to respond to anyone because the next time I checked Reddit, my post had been locked. I didn #8217;t want to sue her but now I #8217;m so fucking pissed I can barely stand it. I was so polite to her and put up with her shit for so long and she #8217;s his mom? I feel violated. I #8217;m pretty sure she knew who I was the entire time and that #8217;s why she was trying her hardest to get me kicked out of the gym. What can I do to her, legally? She harassed me both sexually and verbally for months and I complained multiple times to the gym staff. I finally had enough and basically told her to go fuck herself and I was banned from the gym. And she #8217;s still fucking with me. And in case anyone needs to know, I did find the courage when I was 17 (in 2005) to report him and another adult male who molested me, but no charges were ever filed because of lack of physical evidence. However, the choir teacher was let go from his job. I #8217;m trying to find out if he #8217;s teaching anywhere else.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For example, I have a blanket from my childhood that my daughter is currently using. I would like to pay someone to recreate the blanket as accurately as possible so I can save the original from further deterioration. I also have a picture of a painting I ripped out of a magazine back in  #8216;08 and have never been able to find out any info on it. I #8217;d like someone to paint that for me too.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Why does my dog come over to me just to fart?</TITLE>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m being completely serious. My dog will often come over to be by me just to fart and then walk away. Why? I work from home so I spend most of my day with her by my side or at least in the same room. She will get up from her bed, walk over to me, fart, and then go lie back down. Playing with a toy? Drop the toy, come fart by me, go back to playing with her toy. She #8217;s even woken up from a nap to come plop her ass down at my feet, fart, then head back to La La Land. Is this a thing? Or is my dog just a prankster?</TEXT>
