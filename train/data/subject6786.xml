    <TEXT>The FitnessGram Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues. The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal. A single lap should be completed every time you hear this sound. Remember to run in a straight line and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word start. On your mark. Get ready. Start.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There are two directions ROBLOX can take right now. - Give up children, develop Studio some more to make it a respectable game engine to live up to their motto, and either get rid of or get better moderation for the website. - Fuck everybody over, heavily sponsor Meepcity, terminate all accounts over the age of 8, monetize everything, and become a site for children like Club Penguin. Based on their recent decisions, I think we all know which one they'll choose.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Nickelodeon, to be precise, Dan Schneider's shows, peaked with Drake and Josh/iCarly. The absurdity in his shows was always there, (All That, Kenan and Kel etc.) but they went a little too far with it in iCarly (spaghetti tacos, random slapstick comedy, etc.). It actually worked for most of the show since it made sense for a web show, and it was pretty funny, albeit a significant diversion from Schneider's previous shows. Unfortunately, they continued the absurdity and doubled down on them in Schneider's next shows, Victorious, Sam and Cat, and whatever shows he has going on now. It's a shame we'll never see classic Schneider shows again. That's why I always upvote Drake and Josh memes. I mean, me too thanks.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This meme isn't funny. It's just some shitty rhyme, and it's dumb. You might think this is some dumb attempt at making a copypasta, but it isn't. It's my pure, unvented anger at how /r/me_irl makes the dumbest shit into a meme. Seriously, what makes this funny? "Haha rhyme"? I'd love to know. Every time I see this shitty phrase, I slowly descend farther and farther into madness. Stop it. Get some help.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>(reposted from r/Android because it got removed there) I signed up for it back in September of this year, took the introductory survey honestly, and have not gotten a single one. I've dug through my settings, it has all permissions enabled. I'm on Sprint. What is going on? Do I have to use another account because Google thought that I didn't do the survey truthfully? Can I reset the data for the app on my account?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Okay, I'm still not getting anything after researching. I have location on my phone on, but when I search for location services to see if they're on or not in my settings, it says that they aren't. When I click on the result, it just brings me to location settings, where location is and always has been on. Also, my phone (Samsung Galaxy S7, probably should've mentioned that earlier) just says that Rewards doesn't even need any permissions: https://imgur.com/a/P6Gqx</TEXT>

    <TEXT>When I try to load Kirby's Return to Dreamland from Wiiflow, the game boots up, I press 2 to get past the title screen, and then it hangs on a white screen silently until I hold the power button to shut down my Wii. I followed [this](https://sites.google.com/site/completesg/) guide and installed and tried both IOS 249 and 250 shown in the guide (with 250 being the one leaving me on the white screen). I'm loading a .wbfs file off of a microSD card in a microSD to SD adapter. Help?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Did ModChipsDirect send me a fake R4-SDHC Dual-Core card?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-12-28 20:05:59</DATE>
    <TEXT>I recently bought one while it was on sale [here](http://www.modchipsdirect.com/r4i-sdhc-cheap.html). From what I've seen, current cards normally look different, with a much larger label and a different 2017 logo. [Here](https://imgur.com/a/rACAv) is an Imgur album that contains pictures of both the front and back of the card. It was sent in a box with no other packaging except for a receipt and bubble wrap, as stated in the description on the store page. I've been thinking of hacking my 3DS with it for a while now, but I don't want to brick it in the process if it's counterfeit. Help? Quick ninja edit before anyone sees this: I also downloaded the kernel from the ModChipsDirect page and it works fine with my SanDisk 2GB (non-SDHC) microSD card.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A SWAT team (a team of very strong men with guns, they enforce the law for dangerous situations) are breaking into a meth lab. A meth lab is a place that produces meth, which is a recreational drug that is illegal in many places. The tweeter wears cat ears, which are an accessory that one wears upon their head that mimic the appearance of the ears of cats. Ears are sensory organs that detect vibrations in the air. Cats are animals, specifically mammals that are known for having furry triangular ears on their heads. The tweeter (Sir Paul McCartney) speaks in a certain dialect intended to sound cute. He asks if he can get a reduced sentence for compliance. A reduced sentence would be less time in prison. Prison is a place that people are kept in against their will when they have done illegal things. Compliance is the act of going along with what you are instructed or suggested to do. However the SWAT team shoot the man with a gun. A gun is a device that is used to fire out pieces of metal at very high speeds, if a person was hit with these pieces of metal they would usually die. Dying is when life ends, it usually is referred to the time when the heart stops beating. The heart is an muscular organ that pumps blood (a red liquid) around the body. It is inferred that the SWAT team shoot the man because they dislike his accessory and his way of speaking.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I recently bought a Surface 3 Dock since it was [$185 off](https://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-Docking-Station-compatible-GJ3-00001/dp/B00VGJI1RS) on Amazon, and it arrived a week or two ago. The extra ports are great, but I've been having an issue. When I am idle at my computer for too long, it automatically disconnects and reconnects. This is incredibly annoying, because it turns the display back on, making it stay on for long amounts of time, especially at night, unless I take the extra step and shut it down. I have tried nearly everything, including restarting my computer, making it check for updated drivers, and turning options on and off in settings. Nothing has worked for me. Is there any way to fix this problem?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You seem pretty lost. This is one of Reddit's April Fool's "jokes". Every year, they make a unique social expirement and then drop it (mostly) on April 1st. This is one of them. The rules are: - You may create only one circle - Your circle has a password that is required to enter - Once someone has the password, they can either join the circle, which increases the amount by one (this replaces upvotes in this sub), or betray it, which will kill it off forever</TEXT>

We who once faced those who were in such fear of our power that they sealed us away and banished us to the edge of the galaxy! US! As if THAT loveliness wasn #8217;t enough, they tried to erase our very existence from history! RUDE! Only through our magic were we able to overcome their science and achieve great prosperity! We alone were responsible for stopping that repulsive nightmare of a galactic crisis, yet this is how you repay us! This won #8217;t stand! It won #8217;t be forgiven! It won #8217;t be forgotten! Never ever EVER! Those who called us mad, are you listening? You left us at the edge of the galaxy to be forgotten, then went along your merry way, probably living somewhere pretty and peaceful! But know this! Your future is a farce! You have none! We, masters of a matter most dark, vow to be restored, as foretold in the book of legend, which everyone thought was just a fairy tale! It WASN #8217;T! We have already obtained the vessel that contains our Dark Lord, and he will soon awaken and shower us in compassion! Look! The vessel of our Dark Lord is filling up even as we speak! Now the time for his greatness to enter our world has come! Welcome to a new history! A new age! The age of awesome!

    <TEXT>I think that the multicolor kirbies were in RtDL so they could make all abilities playable in multiplayer, instead of being restricted to Dedede, Meta Knight, and Bandana Dee's movesets. Since there's helpers in Star Allies, all of the abilities (aside from normal Kirby, Sleep, Festival, Mike, and Crash) are playable. I myself wouldn't mind having more kirbies in multiplayer, though.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Would it be the 20th Anniversary, which got a decent collection of games (but not in Europe or Australia), some other neat box inserts, and a couple of Japan-only stuffs... or the 25th Anniversary, which didn't get a cool six-pack, but rather various releases throughout the event (and some of the most blessed art on Twitter)? I honestly can't decide, as I wasn't really as much as a Kirby fan during the 20th as I was during the 25th. What are your thoughts?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Bad preformance and a lot of random shutdowns with latest update. Help?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-05-04 01:38:23</DATE>
    <TEXT>I own a Surface 3 (non-pro, 2GB RAM/64GB storage variant, sack of shit but it's all I have), and decided to do a clean install instead of a regular old update to save up on storage. If I could talk to past me I'd tell myself to get my head out of my ass and buy a new computer. The process kind of went like this: 1. Download update tool and Microsoft's website that can write Windows to a drive and write the latest version of Windows to my 64GB flash drive 2. Go to settings and reboot from flash drive 3. Finish setting up and ponder my life choices I honestly don't know what else to say, so I'll list the issues that has for once made me want to stop using my craptop. - Windows runs noticably laggier. I don't know if it has something to do with the refresh rate of my display, or if it isn't using my device's litte hardware to the fullest extent. I sadly can't really go into further detail about this because when I try to see what's wrong, I can segway into my next issue, which is... - Less than a minute after my computer starts, it just fucking shuts down again. I'm serious. It is always plugged in, and the battery slider is maxed out for best preformance, but every time, it just goes back off again. I know that if I wasn't too keen on this stuff I should've just went with a regular update, and I apologize for fucking jumping off of that cliff. Help?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>My device's internal speakers have suddenly disconnected after going through the process of updating.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-05-05 04:56:46</DATE>
    <TEXT>So, a couple of days ago, I decided to do a clean install instead of a regular update to save on storage and clean up my craptop. [When that didn't end too well](https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows10/comments/8guv2b/bad_preformance_and_a_lot_of_random_shutdowns/?utm_source=reddit-android), I followed it with a factory reset, which thankfully brought everything back to normal on the latest version of Windows 10... except for one thing. I have a Surface 3 2GB/64GB variant, and my tablet's internal speakers no longer show up on the device list. What that also means is no sound for me. I have tried updating and installing drivers to no avail. Audio works fine with headphones and external speakers. I have never had an issue even similar to this relating to audio before. My device is also connected to the official dock, which I updated/reset my computer with. Was this the source of my problems? Did my speakers just happen to disconnect during the update/reset process, and does my computer need to be repaired?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ehhh, while I think that Shadow Kirby would have a more interesting and unique moveset, I can understand why they chose DMK over him. - Shadow Kirby's role was *super* menial in Kirby and the Amazing Mirror. He literally walked around and caught you by surprise a couple of times, but then continued to just kinda stand there. I don't even think the Kirbies needed his help to return home at the end. - Having two Meta Knights is much less confusing than having two Kirbies. People less engrossed in Kirby would definitely find it odd how one Kirby has normal inhaling/spitting powers while the other would (presumably) be much different. Overall, I think that DMK still has the potential to be really unique. He's already shown in the teaser to have 2 unique moves, and it's very likely that he won't just be a sword clone like Meta Knight was, since you can see some of the particles from the mirror ability when he's hiding behind a mirror.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That idea was kinda influenced by [this concept](http://linkandorf.tumblr.com/post/172292710281/heres-a-couple-quick-sketches-showing-a-possible/amp) I saw a while ago, which used a bunch of abilities that have never made a modern appearance in a *long* time. While I thought it would be a great homage, it still just was kind of odd that he used abilities he was never depicted with. But, as you said before, he used the player's copy ability in Kirby Fighters, and, well, *ehhh...* It just gets kinda confusing at that point. I do agree that DMK was the better choice in the end, though.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If you have a 3DS with a compatible ntr-boot flashcard, you can install custom firmware to your device and then use homebrew software to dump a rom from a cartridge onto the SD card. Visit r/3DShacks to learn more. Alternatively, if you own a physical copy of Pokemon Black/White (and optionally any other of the optional games), you can download the rom online since you (presumably) own the games. Edit: According to u/thrik, this is apparently [still illegal](https://www.nintendo.com/corp/legal.jsp#download_rom).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The game uses roms, which are files containing all of the assets and code in Pokemon games, and uses them to build its worlds. I'm not 100% sure on this, but *apparently* if they get the player to provide their own content, it isn't copyright infringement?

    <TEXT>If you're referring to his statement on the next MOTHER being "made by the fans", that was a mistranslation. I believe his actual statement went along the lines of being okay with another entry being made by another studio.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If you're looking for a new battery then I recommend buying an official refurbished one from [Nintendo's online store](https://store.nintendo.com/ng3/us/po/browse/productDetailColorSizePicker.jsp?categoryNav=true amp;navAction=jump amp;navCount=0 amp;atg.multisite.remap=false amp;productId=prod10079 amp;categoryId=cat980174), as ones from third-party sellers usually aren't as good as authentic ones</TEXT>
