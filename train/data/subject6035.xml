    <DATE>2012-06-29 07:36:27</DATE>
    <TEXT>Well, as the title says I'm currently residing in Portland, OR. My name is Zane and I discovered MLP during my second tour in Afghanistan. I recently got out of the Army after six years of service and returned to Portland to pursue my goal of becoming a helicopter pilot. I guess I'm joining the sub in an attempt to actually connect with more bronies. I'm somewhat-active on the MLP sub, but there is always so much content and so many posts it's hard to really get anywhere over there! Especially being I am completely lacking in artistic talent whatsoever. On the up side, sometime in the near future I plan to start messing with pony plushes. I'll make sure to post my first one when (or rather, if) I ever start and/or complete it! If you live in the Portland area and you see a guy driving a black Saab with Rainbow Dash cutie marks on it, I'm that guy. I'll also more than likely be wearing one of my many WLF pony shirts. :D</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Searching for Talented MLP Artists for Merchandising Opportunity! www.Shirts4Bronies.com</TITLE>
    <DATE>2012-08-20 17:43:47</DATE>
    <TEXT>Greetings fellow bronies, I am making this post because I am in need of your help. I am launching a new website that I think can cater towards bronies wants and needs unlike anyone around currently! The site is www.Shirts4Bronies.com, and I am searching far and wide across the internet to find talented MLP artists who are interested in merchandising. If you are a talented artist whose passion is ponies, then please, read on! We will be able to produce a variety of merchandise, including but not limited to: * T-shirts and polos * Hoodies and coats * Headwear such as Ball caps, beanies, fedoras and driving caps. * Blankets and towel sets. * Buttons, stickers, vinyl decals and much more! Since 2006 my family has owned and operated [Striking Graphics  amp; Embroidery](http://www.StrikingGraphics.com) in Beaverton, Oregon. We have many years of experience producing quality embroidery, garment printing, and promotional products. We also own and operate www.Shirts4Bowling.com and other e-commerce sites, where we produce and fulfill custom orders for a wide range of clients. About a year ago I discovered My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic and fell in love with the show and the very talented fandom of bronies that has grown from it. Combining my family's experience in garment decorating and e-commerce, and my knowledge of the brony fandom, we believe that we can offer the brony community nearly any clothing or accessories they could hope for. In addition to offered designs and apparel we will also offer the opportunity to place custom orders to accomodate special interests, such as OC merchandise. For many custom items we produce there is low, or even no minimum production required. We want nothing but the best and most talented artists to help launch the grand opening of the website. We will be able to offer royalties for every item sold using your artwork. Once we have the artwork set up and the store running, you shouldn't have to do much other than kick back and reap the rewards of your hard work! If anyone here is interested, please head on over to our [**ARTWORK SUBMISSION**](http://shirts4bronies.com/?page_id=24) page! I will personally respond to each of your submissions there, and I am more than willing to answer some questions here too! [](/raritydaww)Please, let our fabulous fashionistas help make every bronys' wardrobe 20% cooler! [](/awwyeah)</TEXT>

For the final project in my Introduction to Aviation course in college, we are required to do 10-15 hours of volunteering work in one way or another. Unfortunately as finals approach I'm still a little shy of my required time, so I had the idea to put this together. It does not have to be linked to aviation directly, but I figured being it's for an aviation class I might be able to rely on some reddit friends to help me along! The first time I participated in a World Community Grid group was with the friendly "Benders vs Bronies" competition between /r/TheLastAirbender and /r/MyLittlePony. The response was so great that within just a few weeks over 147 years worth of computing time was donated by thousands of participants! A simple explanation for how this works is, after installing some minor software on your computer, any time your computer is idle the WCG will be activated and it will remotely process data for many different charity and research projects. Any donated time will be automatically tracked and updated on their website, and totals will be tallied for whatever group you are a part of. If you are interested in participating, and have not used World Community Grid in the past, please click [**HERE**](http://www.worldcommunitygrid.org/team/viewTeamInfo.do?teamId=8QRSDK6X12) to join this group. Keep in mind, after registering you will still need to download the WCG program available [**HERE**](http://www.worldcommunitygrid.org/reg/ms/viewDownloadAgain.do) and run it on your computer. Any donated time will be tracked in the total team time! If you are already participating in the World Community Grid project, but would like to join this team, please click [**HERE**](http://www.worldcommunitygrid.org/reg/viewRegister.do?teamID=8QRSDK6X12).

If for whatever reason, you have trouble joining this team, the name is "Aviation" and the BOINC Team ID is "29653". In addition, although I am doing this for a project that is due soon, I plan to continue running this group for at least a few months! **EDIT: Fixed links! (Hopefully)**</TEXT>

    <TITLE>2004 9-3 Linear Brake upgrades?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2013-01-02 20:58:11</DATE>
    <TEXT>I am looking to upgrade from my stock rotors and pads on my 2004 Saab 9-3 Linear. I was looking at [EBC Sport Rotors](/http://www.autoanything.com/brakes/61A3068A0A0.aspx) and [EBC Ultimax Slotted Rotors](/http://www.autoanything.com/brakes/61A3865A0A0.aspx) and their associated brake pads. Has anyone done this swap and has any info on the quality of these sets of rotors and pads? Also, I recently upgraded to 17" wheels from the stock 15" and I was wondering if anyone has used the Maptun brakes? [They're pretty damned spendy](/http://www.stateofnine.com/category/stateofnine.580-saab_performance.0-maptun.20-maptun_brakes/?s=25 amp;p=1), but they seem to be the only option to up the rotor size on a 9-3. (The only option I've been able to find, at least.) Ideally I'd like to up the overall size of the rotors being I now have the wiggle room due to my larger wheels, but I think the prices for the Maptun brakes will hold me back from doing that right now. Anyway, any input would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So, I've been taking a weightlifting class in college and hitting the gym again after about a year long hiatus (I stopped going to the gym regularly after returning from my second deployment to Afghanistan). I'm happy to report that I have been pushing myself quite a bit when it comes to weight lifting. At the start of the year, (Jan 9th) I was able to max leg presses at 340lbs for three sets of 12 reps. Yesterday I had just bumped up to 480lbs for the same three sets of 12 reps, so I'm up 140lbs in my leg presses in just a month and a half! In addition to this, I've added at least 10lbs (in some cases much more) to every single exercise I've been doing since starting to exercise again. I'm seeing quite a bit more definition in my legs and a bit more in my arms, and adding a decent amount of bulk all over. I plan to keep going at this pace for another two months or so, and then I plan on cutting to try and get rid of some of the flab that I've built up since getting out of the Army. Does anyone have any tips for starting out the cutting phase? I've been relatively skinny for the last seven years or so and haven't really had to worry about getting rid of fat until now.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2013-04-10 19:37:22</DATE>
    <TEXT>Do you just think it looks awesome? Do you just *really* hate shaving? Maybe it was a bet or a dare from your friends or family? I'm just wondering where everybody stands. For me, I started growing my beard when I got out of the Army. I was active for six years, so I had to shave at least five days a week for that time. I had to shave *every* day during both of my deployments to Afghanistan. This was very, very annoying to me. While taking care of everything to separate from the military, I was required to talk to a reserve recruiter. He kept offering me bonuses, and benefits, and kept trying to sell me on the idea of transferring to the reserves. Every time he'd tell me some sort of benefit I'd tell him, "But I'd have to shave every month, so that's not happening." The last day I shaved my face was the day I signed out on terminal leave on May 3rd 2012. What's **your** reason for bearding out, bearddit?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Sudden issue getting my secondary display to work.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2013-11-22 00:55:02</DATE>
    <TEXT>For the last month or so I have been using a dual display setup with no issue whatsoever. While player Battlefield 4 two days ago, I had a windows message pop up and suggest that I stop a few processes from starting when Windows boots in order for my system to run more smoothly. If I recall correctly it was two processes related to NVidia - NVIDIA Geforce Experience and the NVIDIA Control Panel. Without thinking I agreed and went back to my game. For the duration of the evening, I had no issues whatsoever. That night I shut down the computer and went to bed. In the morning when I started my computer, the initial boot screen popped up on my secondary monitor as usual. However, once Windows loaded both screens went idle as if they were getting no information. I was able to restart with only my primary monitor installed and it worked fine. I downloaded the latest NVidia driver and performed a clean install, but had no luck with that fixing anything. After searching the web I couldn't find anyone who has had a similar experience, and even NVidia tech support was puzzled when I spoke with them earlier today. Apparently they had never run across this issue. I also performed a system restore to a point that was created on November 16th, well before any of these issues started, but that did not help at all. I have also run msconfig to make sure that all of the available processes are selected to run when the computer starts. I have no idea what else to do! Thanks in advance for any assistance you may be able to give me!

It's crazy to think that your lives may have crossed paths over there! My main question has to do with after liberation. How old were you when you were liberated? How long did it take for you to meet up again with your twin and how were you able to start living your life again just after the liberation/war? Thanks for doing this AMA, things like this really help shed light on stuff that is usually only learned through documentaries and history books.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>When I was on my second deployment to Afghanistan an anti-malaria pill got lodged in my esophagus. Initially it just hurt a bit like I swallowed it funny, but after a day or two I couldn't eat food or drink water without terrible pain. For about a week I kept talking to my units medics and doctors and they kept insisting it was heartburn. After about a week of not being able to eat anything or drink water I finally convinced my doctor to let me go to the hospital. They ran some scans and gave me an endoscopy and determined that the pill got stuck and eroded the lining of my esophagus. I ended up being in the hospital for about 5 days while my throat healed up and they had me on IV nutrients because I couldn't eat. The thing that made it really embarrassing wasn't necessarily what I was in there for, but the fact that they kept me in the ICU with a bunch of guys who were wounded in combat. One day we were all awake and everyone was talking about their injuries and such. Soldier 1: "Yeah, I was a gunner in an MRAP. We hit an IED, the truck flipped, and I lost both my legs." Soldier 2: "Oh man, my squad got ambushed and I got shot in the spine. I may never walk again." Soldier 3: "I was out at a small base and we got hit by some rockets. One of our ammo caches exploded and I got a bunch of third degree burns." "What about you, zraddue? What happened to you?" Me: "Oh, well, you see... I swallowed a pill funny and now I can't eat..." What made it even more embarrassing was that everyone in there felt really bad for me, because every single time meals were brought in, despite my bed having a big sign that said "NO FOOD", the nurses would always forget and place a meal in front of me. That shit was like torture.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This guy knows what's up. Good advice. I'd suggest you also go for an older bike that isn't too expensive so if you drop it you won't kick yourself too hard. Also, remember to factor in the cost of gear. I'd suggest a full face helmet, ce padded jacket, gloves and boots at a minimum. I'd also suggest you get yourself some good riding pants too, but you cooing make due with jeans fit starting. Keep in mind, with a motorcycle, the bodywork is done in the hospital. A little money on gear can save you quite a bit of money and pain if you have a wreck. Feel free to ask if you have any other questions!</TEXT>

There was one dining facility near our living quarters that was often downwind of the poo pond. On a hot day it wasn't unusual to walk out of the place, catch a whiff of the poo pond and puke. The exit to that place quite often had puddles of vomit everywhere. **EDIT:** [Here's a google maps link that will show you how large it is, and where it's located.](https://www.google.com/maps/@31.491195,65.8385923,603m/data=!3m1!1e3) **TL;DR:** Don't got to Kandahar.</TEXT>

My roommate recently purchased a salvage-titled motorcycle and had no issue registering or insuring it in the state of Oregon. Your mileage may vary though. :\</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I went to a friends Halloween party a few years back as [Jesus. \(Had the beard, didn't have the long hair so I had to wear a wig.\)](http://i.imgur.com/xp2NqhY.jpg) My buddies Halloween party is usually the craziest of all the parties he threw every year, so I had to do something awesome. On the way to the party I dropped by the local Christian church supply store. I grabbed a box of communion wafers and those little communion cups. Once I got to the party I walked around with them making people do "Jesus Drop Shots", where people had to drop a wafer into a cup of wine or some other shot and drink with me. I got pretty wasted pretty quickly being I was drinking with EVERYONE, and everyone also wanted to get wasted with Jesus. Not long into the party the host busts out his breathalyzer, which at his parties is never used to make sure people are good to drive, but more as a competition. By the end of the night I won by blowing a 0.36, very near the level of fatal alcohol poisoning. When people told me that I might die I just told them that I'd already done so once, I would rise again. Once everyone had fallen asleep or taken off I managed to stumble outside and puke all over the front porch/lawn. The vomit was an insanely bright pink color and had the consistency of foam due to the amount of wine I drank and the amount of communion crackers I ate. **TL;DR: Was Jesus for Halloween, didn't turn water to wine, but I turned my blood to wine.**</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I completely understand what you mean about kids shows. I know you may have heard about My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic. You should check it out. The fan base (Bronies) can be a little crazy or overbearing sometimes, but it's a really good show. It premiered right before my second deployment and I found out about it while I was in Afghanistan. I was able to download most of the first season over there and I loved it. The cheeriness, the colors, the characters, the humor... It was all such a stark contrast to what I dealt with daily over there. It helped me through a shitty time.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Unfortunately with reddit images seem to do better than any self posts, with the exception of subs that expressly forbid image macros, etc. That being said, I agree with your comments in your thread. The MGs are wildly non-authentic and I think they need a big change. I just recently saved up for and got the MG34 and was severely disappointed. There are many things wrong with the weapon, especially when the game seems to be somewhat realistic with most other weapons.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Where do you order your film at? I'm still running through a lot of my fathers old stuff. This was shot with old Kodak Ektar that was produced back before it was discontinued back in 1994. I think that's one of the reasons this photo came out the way it did. Pictures can be kinda funky with 20+ year old film. I also agree with you about the fact that film is fun and more of a challenge. You definitely have to choose your shots wisely. I caught myself multiple times that day taking a shot and instinctively trying to look at it on a screen like it was a DSLR. I plan to pick up a decent DSLR in the near future, hopefully I can find something that will be compatible with the A1 lenses as my father has some great gear for it. I **love** film but it seems like the costs will really add up as I'm essentially trying to figure out the basics all over again. This was the first time I've used an SLR in about 10 years.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>When I was in the Army my company did physical training (PT) every weekday at 6:30. One morning I woke up, jumped out of bed and got ready. I walked out of my barracks to the car and drove to the field down the road where we usually meet for PT. I parked and sat there for about 15 minutes before I realized that nobody else was showing up. As I kept waiting and waiting I figured something was wrong. I thought that maybe PT was cancelled, or that we were going to be doing it at a different location or something. As I was pulling my phone out of my pocket to call my squad leader I realized it was 2:30 in the morning. On a Saturday. Went back to the barracks and went right back to sleep.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Good call on the brain stem part. Quick and guaranteed is the way you'd want to do it. When I was in the Army, a bunch of my buddies and I would sometimes talk about suicide (not that we wanted to commit suicide, but we dealt with suicide prevention briefings and such regularly). Lots of the time we would talk about how we'd do it if we actually wanted to kill ourselves. My plan was along the lines of this: load up an entire 200 round belt into my M249, place on ground on its bipod. Next, lay directly in front of machine gun with barrel in mouth, and quickly zip tie the trigger back. 200 rounds of. 556 will definitely do the job, and cause a "what the fuck" to anyone who has to deal with that shit afterwards.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I more or less want to freshen up the 440. While searching for builds I ran across this, and it's more or less what I want to get that engine up to. Maybe *slightly* more aggressive, but not much. I just want something with a bit more power than the 361 and when my coworker said he wanted to get rid of this 440 I jumped on it. As for the transmission, the car currently has a 727 with a push button. I'm a member of a 1960-62 Chrysler group on facebook and I asked about it, and a few members said that the 440 should mate to the transmission without problems, but I guess we'll see when the time comes to pull it. I'll make sure to post updates as the project comes along, but it may be a while as I have a 1952 Chevy truck with an engine that's begging for a rebuild too. I may knock that one out first because the Chrysler currently runs, but the Chevy doesn't right now.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well, being it's a handmade rifle that he produces in very low numbers (they say they make five a year in the video posted above) with a very interesting firing mechanism, I'd say it isn't too crazy of a price. That being said, that price is in decent brand new car territory. I personally wouldn't be able to justify dropping that much cash on a rifle.</TEXT>

A drunk driver plowed into my car IN MY DRIVEWAY and drove off. He left half of a wheel and lots of suspension and driveline components laying in my yard. I called the cops, they showed up in about two minutes and only had to follow the massive gouges in the pavement to the guys house about two blocks away, who just so happened to be trying to cover up his car with a Tarp. He had just bought the car that night and was out celebrating the purchase. He didn't even have insurance. I'll see if I can find the picture album on imgur when I'm off work...</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Just figured out which ribbons are which, they are as follows: (Left to Right) 1st row: [Navy  amp; Marine Corps Commendation Medal Ribbon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commendation_Medal) w/ V \(Valor\) device, [Navy  amp; Marine Corps Achievement Medal Ribbon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achievement_Medal), [Coast Guard Combat Action Ribbon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combat_Action_Ribbon). 2nd row: [Navy Unit Commendation Ribbon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navy_Unit_Commendation) (Unit Award), [Navy Good Conduct Medal Ribbon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Conduct_Medal_\(United_States\)) w/ bronze star device, [National Defense Service Medal Ribbon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Defense_Service_Medal) w/ bronze star device. 3rd row: [Battlefield Efficiency Ribbon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navy_E_Ribbon), [Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal Ribbon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_Forces_Expeditionary_Medal), [Vietnam Service Medal Ribbon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_Service_Medal). 4th row: [Republic of Vietnam Gallantry Cross Unit Citation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallantry_Cross_\(Vietnam\)) (Unit Award), [Republic of Vietnam Campaign Medal Ribbon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_Campaign_Medal), [Navy Marksman Rifle Medal Ribbon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marksmanship_Medal). EDIT: Updated each ribbon listed with a link to each Wikipedia page for more info on the ribbons. It would appear that whoever this ribbon rack belonged to was a member of the US Navy and/or Coast Guard throughout their military service, which included combat action in Vietnam. OP, do you know of any family members who were in Vietnam?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Here's an idea of what an empty ribbon rack looks like. The individual ribbons are slid onto those rails, and the rack has a few pins on the back side that pin the whole assembly to the uniform. http://www.militaryclothing.com/ProductZoom.aspx?zpid=13112 amp;prdtImgName= amp;prdtImgfile=</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There's a Vietnam Campaign Medal among those ribbons, so I would really doubt that. There's no WWI or WWII service ribbons either, so it's doubtful that this rack belonged to OPs great grandfather. Maybe a friend, or someone else in the family? It could also just be something that someone picked up at a garage or estate sale.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The steering wheel isn't really oblong, just kinda flattened at the bottom. Also, the thing in the dash is a fertility idol wearing a hula skirt that a buddy picked up for me from Hawaii. That makes it sound kind of fancy, but It's really just a carved wooden dick ashtray. The car looks really good at a distance, but the paint is in terrible shape and I hope to respray in a few years one I have the suspension and drive train straightened out. I'll be dropping a 440 into it once I get the engine rebuilt. The car has a 361 right now with a push button automatic.</TEXT>

An R34 would be awesome, but I wouldn't be there long enough to legally import the oldest model year by the time I come back to the states. That being said, I'm really not terribly familiar with the vehicles. A buddy of mine who's super into the JDM scene also suggested keeping my eyes open for an FD RX7 or something along those lines too. Then again, I might just scoop up some goofy kei car because that would be neat too. And definitely cheaper!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>One of the concerns most people in this thread have had were with safety in a wreck or the jack snagging on something. Having the jaw facing forward would cause the jack to inflict more damage on anything in a collision, and it would up the chances that I would get it snagged on something. That's the main reason I installed it on the mount the direction it is facing. I also really doubt the mounts would fail. [They're incredibly beefy and manufactured by Hi-Lift.](https://amzn.com/B003CEODQI) I also make sure to check the hardware regularly (about every week) to make sure nothing is rattling loose. I haven't had to re-tighten anything since I installed them about 4 months ago. Any wreck bad enough to dislodge those mounts probably wouldn't be survivable by anyone involved.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Here's a pretty decent writeup from [Forgotten Weapons.](https://www.forgottenweapons.com/the-worst-gun-ever/) The biggest issues it had was with the .30-06 conversion, and the fact that the magazine springs were weak and would often have issues if loaded to full capacity. Wasn't the greatest around, but it certainly wasn't the worst design either. (For the time, of course.) Edit: [Link to the video if you'd prefer. ](https://youtu.be/bCwP3Dm52Ls) Definitely worth a watch.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>www.usajobs.gov has plenty of listings in lots of different fields all across the world. I was in for six years as a blackhawk helicopter mechanic and recently got a gig doing the exact same job as a civilian helicopter mechanic for the Department of the Army in Japan. It was a lengthy process, but I got the position and I'm moving out there for 3-5 years next month! While the pay isn't quite as good as similar contract work, the benefits are pretty much top notch. It's worth looking into.</TEXT>

They put out videos regularly talking about what happened exactly 100 years ago during the war, along with plenty of other interesting videos including Q amp;A's, field trips to museums and battle sites from the war, etc. Definitely binge worthy, and they'll be putting out lots of high quality content for at least another two years!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'd definitely refer to it as "cozy." The one I sat in had stock seats, the one I'm hopefully buying has aftermarket seats that should sit a little lower and further back than the stock seats. If not I'll mod it to provide as much room as possible. I'm also planning on installing a removable flat-bottomed steering wheel to make getting in and out a bit easier. All that being said, it was much easier to get in and out of than I would have imagined.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I just purchased one of my attainable dream cars. A 1994 Autozam AZ-1 M2 1015.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-07-22 17:02:00</DATE>
    <TEXT>[This is my 1994 Autozam AZ-1 M2 1015.](http://imgur.com/a/EoGTd) The AZ-1 is a Japanese kei car that was created by a partnership between Mazda and Suzuki, and is a car that I've known about for a few years and have always wanted to get my hands on. The Autozam AZ-1 is a turbocharged, mid engined, rear wheel drive sports kei car. One of the coolest things about the car is the fact that it features gullwing doors, similar to those on the Mercedes-Benz 300SL and of course, the DeLorean DMC-12. Less than 5,000 AZ-1's were produced from 1992 to 1994. The kei car is a class of vehicles that have to meet specific standards set by the Japanese govermnent, which, as of 1990 states that a vehicle can be no longer than 3.3 meters (10.8 ft), no wider than 1.4 meters (4.6 ft), and have a maximum height of 2 meters (6.6 ft). In addition to the size regulations, no kei car is to be able to carry more than four passengers, and may not have an engine larger than 660cc, creating no more than 63hp. Even though I'm 6'4" and had been told that if you're over 5'10" you shouldn't even bother, I was determined to find one and at least see if I fit in it. I found one shortly after arriving in Japan and took a nice 320km drive out to Nagoya just to see if I could wedge myself into the seat. It was a success, though that particular car wasn't in quite as good of shape as I was hoping, so I kept my eyes open for other deals. I ran across this great car with only 65,615 original kilometers on the dial shortly after. In the last year of production, the M2 1015 was created by M2 Incorporated, which was one of Mazda's group companies. The biggest tell-tale signs of an M2 1015 are the front fog lights molded into the hood and a differently styled front bumper and rear spoiler. M2 Incorporated was supposed to build 50 of these special editon AZ-1's, but only managed to produce about 25 of them. Long story short, the M2 1015 is the rarest of the Autozam AZ-1s, which is already a very rare car. Knowing about the rarity of the M2 1015 I jumped at the opportunity to buy this car sight-unseen! Driving it is an absolute blast, it's basically a street legal go kart. It's not exactly fast with only 63hp, but the car only weighs a total of 720kg (1,584lbs), so it's pretty quick and nimble. One of the best bits of this car is the quick-revving engine which happily runs up to a redline of 9,000 rpm.</TEXT>

That's probably why you hear about that specific height a fair amount... (j/k, all 600,000 6'4" reddit accounts are mine.)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well, I'm planning on pulling the seats off the adjustable rails and bolting them directly to the floor. That will enable me to move the seats back another 1 1/2 to 2 inches and drop them down a few inches too. In addition to that I'm going to make the steering wheel removable in order to make getting in and out of the car a bit easier, and I'd like to also modify it with a tilt wheel, because in its current position at my height the top of the wheel blocks the top half of the guage cluster.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This car isn't exactly affordable due to the rarity and the demand for them, but most kei cars are extremely affordable. They were created as a class of cars by the government to help modernize and mobilize the Japanese citizens after WWII on the cheap, and they've been popular ever since. Probably at least half of the cars on Japanese roads are kei cars. As for the power, most aren't exactly exciting to drive, but the AZ-1 is definitely different. In the early 90s car manufacturers were really pushing the boundaries to try and get the most fun possible out of their cars and still meet the kei car regulations. They're not truly fast cars, but they're a shitload of fun to drive. Plus, it may only have 63bhp, but in a 1,600lb car that's definitely enough to have fun!</TEXT>

I'd usually be out the door of my barracks by 6:15 and take a short drive to the nearby PT field where my Company met each morning, Monday through Friday. One morning I got up, got dressed, drove over to the PT field and parked. I sat there for about 10-15 minutes and wondered where everyone was. I finally looked at the clock in my car and it was 2:30am... On a Saturday.</TEXT>

A news channel happened to be on when I turned the TV on and I saw the first tower burning. I came my Dad in and he wouldn't come into the room because he was too busy cooking. I yelled something along the lines of, "No, seriously, get in here right now!" He walked in to see what was going on saying something along the lines of "What could possibly be so important?" Right as he walked into the room and saw the TV the second plane hit the other tower.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>One day when I was a teenager I was lounging around on the couch watching movies. My brothers elderly, kinda senile cat had taken to joining me in being lazy, usually laying on my chest facing towards my head. At some point my mother walked in an asked me a question, and while I was answering, the cat lunged forward and stuck her tongue in my mouth, then went bounding off to who knows where. That was a pretty fucking terrible taste.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks! I really like the color too. It definitely stands out. It's really not too bad. It'll definitely be easier to live with once I get it back to the states in a few years and it isn't my only car though! To aid in me fitting a bit better I installed a steering wheel quick disconnect and swapped the drivers seat for an NB Miata seat. Luckily the AZ-1 and Miata seat mounts on the drivers side are almost completely identical. I've still gotta mock up and weld together a mount for the passenger seat in order to swap that one too.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>At first the bed leveling is kinda counter-intuitive. If you're tightening the screws in each corner you'll actually be lowering the bed. Try loosening them all up a bit and see if that helps you close that gap. You'll want to print either directly on the glass or you can use that tape on one side of the glass and print on that. I've found that I get better adhesion just printing directly on the glass with a little bit of glue from a glue stock rubbed on the print area after the bed is heated but before the nozzle us heated.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That sounds like it's a problem with the print file. I know lots of people have issues with the attached files, like with the included cat it often messes up around the head. I scrape off any remaining glue with a razor and then clean the glass thoroughly with windex in between prints.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes. It comes partially built, but you still have to do some final assembly. Once it's together you have to level the print bed and possibly make some other minor adjustments. If you're seriously interested there's quite a few videos on Youtube which go over setup and beginning printing in detail, as well as a Facebook group that is very helpful. Without those sources I'd still probably be trying to print my first models.</TEXT>

As a fan of the books, I absolutely hated it. Trying to look at it through the eyes of someone who hasn't read the books, absolutely none of it made any sense whatsoever. What really sucks though is the fact that the movie was such a dumpster fire that any chance of it getting attention and possibly enough of a following to make something worthwhile, such as a mini series or show based on the books, has essentially evaporated.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It all depends on the level of inspection. If it's just a quick once-over? Yeah, I'd agree with you. On the other side though, for example, I live in Japan and have had multiple vehicles, both autos and motorcycles inspected while registering. Every single vehicle is THOROUGHLY inspected, down to essentially the last bolt and nut that can be effected by regular use. If something doesn't pass you can take it to a shop and have it fixed and try again. The number of cars on Japanese streets that are in remotely bad levels of disrepair is essentially zero. In the last few months I've only seen one car on the side of the road, and that was simply due to a blow out. On american streets I rarely drive more than 30 miles on an interstate without seeing a car or two on the side of the road.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Depending on condition, mods, model (standard, Mazda Speed, M2) and mileage on them you'll probably be looking anywhere from  #165;1,000,000-2,200,000. I purchased mine from a dealer in Saitama Prefecture that currently has a few available, in addition to some Cappuccinos and such too. As far as I'm aware, laws for modifying kei cars are basically the same as standard cars, but I believe that if you modify it to an extent where it no longer fits the kei class, you'll have to register it with a white plate. I'm not 100% on this though. There's a bit of an aftermarket. Lots of owners out here modify the car quite a bit, and you can see lots of great examples on Instagram. Luckily a lot of normal wear parts can still be gotten through Mazda, and engine parts are plentiful due to the engine or variants being in loads of other cars. Yahoo auctions is a good place to look for parts, just search the chassis code, "PG6SA" (Autozam) or "PG6SS" (Suzuki)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, it's pretty insane the amount of bags that they use for EVERYTHING. I've bought a few things and the cashier will bag up each item separately, tape them closed, then put those bags into another larger bags. It's insane. On top of that, yesterday I was fishing in Yokohama bay and the amount of plastic bags and bottles, styrofoam, etc floating around in that water was astounding. I'm also far from some incredibly eco-conscious person, but it's not hard to limit the usage of plastics day to day.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm not in Tokyo, but rather Zama in Kanagawa. I'd suggest you try if possible to get a bit further out of the city into the smaller "suburbs." I've found that with lots of thrift shopping you can often find similar stuff in Tokyo and outside Tokyo, but many prices will be much higher in Tokyo. One of the places I go around here is Wattmann. They've got a few locations around my area. Other than that at the standard off houses, like the other commenter suggests, you should scope out some local flea markets if your schedule coincides with any.</TEXT>
