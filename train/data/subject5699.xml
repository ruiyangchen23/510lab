    <TITLE>[TOMT][Song] Deep/Tech House track that Shazam can't find.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2013-12-27 16:08:31</DATE>
    <TEXT>I have heard this track in clubs a few times and its awesome, but Shazam always fails to ID it. It keeps popping into my head every few hours and its driving me mad. Does anybody know what the track is? I only know the chorus/hook. I'm pretty sure it is a recent track, and is a current genre of house. https://soundcloud.com/matthouse-2/what-is-this-track (Please excuse my screechy whistling.)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I would probably suggest using MQSQL or SQLite, depending if you intend for this to be a standalone application or not. SQLite is self contained, MYSQL would be ideal if you wanted to create this as a web app, maybe so it could be accessed from any computer? (Look into ASP.NET maybe...) Both are free and will work with just about any language. Good practise to make CRUD (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) methods to access and modify your data.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I agree with BrainMaster5000 about Canterbury Tales. Lovely pub, great selection of ales. Gulbenkian is great, comedians often do their practise gigs there to test material etc, usually only  #163;10-15. The Cuban is very good as a bar, not too studenty. Plenty of restaurants, Cafe du Soleil is fantastic. Ashford isn't far either. All in all really nice city. As a student myself I would recommend avoiding living at the bottom of Elliot footpath which leads to uni or you'll face getting woken up by students returning to halls in the early hours. Hales Place also has a heavy student population, so maybe avoid their too. Hope that helps!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Definitly go smaller. You can always get a longer stem if needed. Get a fit regardless. In the UK you should be able to haggle a fit into the price of the bike really if you're going to a decent LBS and spending a decent amount. If you can't get a fit (maybe not at  #163;400), watch a few youtube videos about getting it right. GCN is a very good channel to subscribe to and has a tutorial on fit: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VYhyppWTDc.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Titanium will be slightly heavier, but far more durable. I bought a second hand titanium frame, must be 15-20 years old (heavily upgraded now mind) and it is indestructible. The main reason that titanium bikes are slightly more expensive is because the tools used to make them get worn down so quickly due to how hard the material is. If you crash on titanium, you might end up with a dent in a tube or something slightly bent...crash on carbon and impact force can easily totally destroy a bike beyond repair. Carbon is indeed very strong, but only in the way for which the frame was designed...it is not strong in all direction and certainly not hard. You'll have a relatively small choice of bike if you go for tit though...and carbon is far more forgiving and I love my carbon bike more than any of my others. My advice...test ride a few and see what you like.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Although carbon is very stiff, when they design the frames, some of the tubes are designed to give a little, for example the seat stays and the forks. This means that they absorb some of the shock from bumps in the road, but at the same time the carbon in the bottom bracket and chain stays is extreamly stiff to transfer as much energy from your legs to the wheels. Titanium is the same all over. It certainly makes for a more comfortable ride, especially when you hid 3-4+ hours in the saddle. If you do decide with tit, you could improve the comfort of the ride with a carbon seatpost, and maybe 25c tyres anyway...lots of options!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Which power meter?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2014-01-10 17:47:40</DATE>
    <TEXT>I cycle about 5000km a year and I am looking to purchase a power meter to improve my training. However, the 2 LBSs in the town where I live don't stock any as they are a little pricey. This means I am going to have to order one online without seeing it first or talk to somebody about how they work and what's best. Ideally I would like to get one as cheap as possible...but only if it will do the job. I certainly don't want to be spending  gt; #163;1000. Does anybody have any recommendations? I have seen the stages power meters which look really good, especially at their price point, also this connects with bluetooth so it can connect straight to my strava app. Also does anybody know if any connect via bluetooth and ant+ at the same time? So can record on Garmin and phone simultaneously? (This isn't important at all but would be cool.) Any first hand experience would be really appreciated!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>After looking into power meters a lot recently ahead of a purchase I soon came to the conclusion that the Stages power meter was going to be the one for me. But this mainly came down to price. Although a bit of a shock, its good to see that Sky have taken them on board over SRM, and this should help really boost the little company.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I agree with SlowMoe. Di2 is cool, and mildly better, however that extra  #163;1000 would be put to much better use in wheels or frame. Unless you're really really serious about competing or just have pots of money sitting around Ultegra or the SRAM equivalent (I think SRAM Force) is more than enough.</TEXT>

It may offend some people...most definitely. Does that matter really? Not at all. To quote Stephen Fry "It's now very common to hear people say, 'I'm rather offended by that.' As if that gives them certain rights. It's actually nothing more... than a whine. 'I find that offensive.' It has no meaning; it has no purpose; it has no reason to be respected as a phrase. 'I am offended by that.' Well, so fucking what." If people are gunna moan about something, moan about something which matters or is really affecting people.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>What would be the consequence of wrongful prosecution by a company, when the problem turned out to be a software bug in the prosecuting company's software? (UK)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2014-03-31 13:08:45</DATE>
    <TEXT>I am doing a small university project, where we are discussing the Post Office accounting system bug. Here's detailed summary: http://www.computerweekly.com/news/2240089230/Bankruptcy-prosecution-and-disrupted-livelihoods-Postmasters-tell-their-story Essentially many post office masters have been prosecuted, due to supposed shortfalls in their takings. This has later been discovered to be due to a software bug in the post office accounting system. People have lost their houses, gone bankrupt and even a few have gone to prison. In the cases where people have gone to prison this is due to false accounting, because they were signing off accounts which were incorrect. In many cases this was because they feared that they would not be able to open the office the next day, and that they would lose more money. If this was the case, would there be any compensation for the post masters that went to prison? Although they did sign off the accounts, the only reason the accounts were wrong was because of the software bug. What rights would the post masters have? And for those who were forced to pay back money which was wrongly accounted for by the system, what rights do they have? Cheers guys!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I used this many years ago to get an insight into programming, and have since introduced my 8 year old cousin to it. Its simple to use, and underpins some of the core aspects of programming. He has made some really quite intricate games using this program and I would highly recommend it to anybody with children who want to get them into programming. There's nothing wrong with starting early!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Moving to Knutsford</TITLE>
    <DATE>2014-04-07 21:06:56</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hello! I will be starting work at Barclays in September and will be relocating to Knutsford from Poole. I will be working at Radbroke Hall (WA16 9EU) and probably cycling to work most days so it would be nice to live somewhere within 5-10 miles of the office. I'm probably going to try and find a house share or lodge with somebody? Which areas are nice? Where should I avoid? Im also really into house music and the clubbing scene. Is the nightlife in the area any good? Or do you really have to travel Manchester or Liverpool for anything worthwhile? I'm also really into my cycling, what's the scenery like in Cheshire? Anybody know of any cycling clubs? Cheers guys!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks for your reply. I think Withington etc may be just a little too far away, that's starting to approach an hours commute by bike, and I don't really want to drive. I'm happy with Knutsford being quiet with Manchester and Liverpool being so close :) Ok, I have heard good thinks about warehouse project in Manchester...have you been? I hope be heading into London pretty regularly to "go large" as you put it :) I'm a roadie unfortunately! Been thinking about getting a new mountain bike though, so shall take that on board!

    <TEXT>If the company is big enough, I would accept and politely let them know that you have had a different offer if something else comes up. It's far from ideal, but if the company is big, they will easily absorb the blow and find somebody else. The recruitment process would be much more damaging for a smaller company due to the expense. So maybe don't do that, if that is the case. You might look like a bit of an ass, but I wouldn't worry about that too much. In the current economic climate, you can't be too picky.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>One of the most important things is that the bike fits! Get the right frame size. In the UK a bike fit can cost between  #163;40- #163;140, but it is really worth the money. Make sure you mark all the distances with tip ex though! If it fits right, you'll be more comfortable and be able to transfer power much more efficiently. A helmet. Hydration is also extremely important, so two bottles and bottle cages. A helmet. I would recommend getting a saddle bag, multi tool, tyre levers and a mini pump to take out on rides. As nice extras if you have the cash, some bib shorts (they go over your shoulders) will make riding more comfy. And clip less pedals and shoes. If it's your first clip less shoes, maybe go with SDP cleats and then you can use some double sided pedals so you don't have to worry about clipping in if you feel like it. A helmet. Also, download Strava, it's an app for recording routes and I personally find it fantastic motivation to push yourself and to beat your previous times! Free too! A bike computer might be nice to go with this too. Happy cycling!!!!</TEXT>

Although, that said the road surface here will be much better than what we saw in the first couple of days in Italy as they will be used to the rain and cold. The main problem when they neutralised it in the first week was that the roads had been dry for weeks, and then the rain caused oil and dirt that had built up on the roads to become slippy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Road cyclist here. What ever you make sure you workout your whole body, not just legs. I tend to group: back and bis, chest and tris, legs and core, shoulders. On leg day, I do a variety of exercises but tend to have a higher number of reps per set for squats. 15-20. This will help build endurance, as well as muscle mass. Same when I do deadlifts on back day. If you're a keen cyclist you'll probably find that you'll be quite good at both deadlifts and squats from the off. I'm a more muscular rider, a sprinter, certainly not a climber. If you're a climber, this added muscle mass is almost certainly going to have a negative effect. I don't compete I might add, but do cycle around 4000km a year. I see this as a workout to make me fitter all round, in strength, and not just make me a bit better on the bike. That is just a bonus. I hope this helps.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A good mix of complex and simple carbs. I believe the idea ratio is 2:1 complex:simple. But unless you're a professional, just eat some fruit and something like a cereal bar. Maybe a jam sandwich. Nothing fancy, it's all the same, getting the ratio right is just marginal gains.

Its such a terrible advert that I only found this post by googling "terrible mo farah advert" to see if anybody else was as shocked at how poor it was. Its so boring, rehearsed and lacks any life. Mo is a fantastic runner, but he is certainly not a sports personality and I don't see him finding a TV career after he retires.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Do not go with Regal. Terrible admin fee to start with,  #163;149 per person.  #163;168 checkout fee! And they tried to take a large chunk of our deposit for things which were there when we moved in. They were also extremely slow at getting things fixed. The worst bit is the check out fee though, it took about 20mins for one person to come round to check the inventory, and they plucked a  #163;168 charge out the air for that!? It was only a two bedroom house!?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I will be starting work in Knutsford next week but living in Northwich. Ideally I'm looking for a gym in between both, or in Northwich. Really not bothered about pool or sauna etc, or the quality of the machines, but I do want a decent free weights area and for to not be over subscribed. Does anybody have any recommendations?

    <TEXT>The shimano over the micro shift levers will be a little better, smoother and more reliable shifting. The carbon fork will really improve the quality of the ride as it is designed to absorb bumps. The weight will make little difference. It also looks a bit nicer if you're bothered about that. In my opinion for  #163;70 it's probably worth it. I have ridden my friend's 500 and I was very impressed; for the money you won't get a better deal in the UK.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It could be a combination of not only the saddle, but also the bike fit. I would recommend making sure your bike is set up correctly (GCN have a quick and easy guide on this on YouTube) and then just trying loads of saddles. I tried 3 before deciding on my current one, and I have had 2 of them now because I know it's good for me.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Waveform Tattoo...Help/Ideas</TITLE>
    <DATE>2014-10-09 21:05:43</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi guys. I am looking to get a waveform of my favourite song on my forearm, probably about 6" long. The image below is what I had in mind, but on reflection, even at 6 inches, there is too much detail on the image, and the line are too fine and too close. I don't think it will age very well at all. Any ideas on how this could be stylised, to avoid this problem but still retain the original idea? http://i.imgur.com/MlQMp1b.png</TEXT>

    <DATE>2014-10-14 22:59:18</DATE>
    <TEXT>I not sure if this is the correct sub for this sort of thing but here goes. I want to get this waveform edited but in a resolution which is good enough so that I can get it tattooed on my arm. The image I have is very pixellated. I think the best way to get this to an appropriate standard for tattooing, is to re-draw the wave, but it is important that the new image retains the overall shape and colouring. The lines of the image will need to be relatively simple so that it still looks good as the tattoo ages. If you think that you can help me here, please reply here or PM me arrange something. I know its only a small job but I hope you guys will be able to help. Thanks! http://i.imgur.com/OchM0o1.png</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Good deed of the day. People cycling without lights at night. Help them out, give them some lights?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2015-01-09 22:59:18</DATE>
    <TEXT>Today I was driving home from work (didn't cycle today I'm afraid) at night along an urban road without street lighting and almost hit a young LAD on a his bike as he had no lights. To be honest I was angry. I see somebody on their bike every week without lights without fail. I passed him safely and a little further down the road I remembered that I had some cheap LED lights (the ones which have the little loop of elastic to attach them) in the boot which I purchased before Christmas at Tesco as they were super cheap. I pulled over further down the road and flagged him down when he got to me. And I gave him a bit of a lecture (he was only 16/17) and gave him the lights and told him to put them on. After we managed to get the packet open, we put them on and he thanked me and then I drove off. Anyway this got me thinking, maybe I could always do this. So I've just purchased 2 more sets of front and back lights on eBay. Slightly better ones, with batteries and they were only  #163;4. I intend to hand these out to people when I see them riding with no lights. Its a little thing but it could really save somebody's life. Maybe as a cycling community we could all do the same and help people out if you can? If you have an old set of lights, maybe you can just keep them in the car? Or just buy a cheap set next time your at the supermarket and hand them out when you see somebody riding dangerously?</TEXT>

    <DATE>2015-01-13 21:51:45</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hey guys, newbie here. I'm looking to build my own engines but have a few questions about the process. Ideally I would like to use the method described in this video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12fR9neVnS8) where by the KNO3 and sugar are incredibly fine and then compacted heavily. The reason for this is primarily because I only have a gas hob to heat the mixture if I were to melt the sugar with the KNO3, and don't like the idea of having it near naked flames like that. How effective is this method in comparison? In the video he used a burning fuse, which I don't really want to do either. Will these ignite with an estes rocket igniter? He also uses black powder to create a release mechanism for the recovery kit, is there an alternative that I can use to black powder? I can't get it in the UK. Thanks guys!</TEXT>

I only used about 15grams in my test (http://youtu.be/Dq7edgWAIiw) and it appeared to work perfectly. I made the hole with a drill bit by hand too as to be safe. Thanks for the tip about the black powder, I'll give that a go. Then I'll make a larger engine and test, then a full rocket :-)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Road bike with rack mounts, disc brakes and carbon fork, under  #163;1000?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2015-03-22 18:31:11</DATE>
    <TEXT>I am looking to get a bike on the cycle to work scheme in the UK which allows me to get a bike up to the value of  #163;1000. My commute is quite long so the bike needs to have rack mounts foremost, but I also want it to look nice and have a carbon fork. Ideally disc brakes too but I feel I may be pushing the budget here. I can't seem to find anything that really stands out as being a nice bike, or they're all slightly over the  #163;1000 mark. Got any recommendations guys?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>How to compliment my savings. Nutmeg.com?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2015-03-25 15:41:33</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi guys I'm after a little advice! I #8217;m 23, recently graduated, have a well-paying job ( #163;39500) and my outgoings are pretty low. Monthly savings: - My work contribute 10% of my salary to my pension and to that I add another 7.5% to this I also get their national insurance saving. This comes to about  #163;555 going in my pension pot each month which I can obviously not touch. - I put  #163;300 into a savings account (currently paying 6% but capped @  #163;300/month) each month. - I have just opened a cash ISA which I will also put  #163;300 in each month. Currently have. -  #163;4k in pension pot. -  #163;3000 in savings (total). -  #163;1200 of shares in the place I work, which they have matched with a further  #163;1200. The matched shares are locked in for 3 years, but I could withdraw the others if I really needed them. And after 5 years they will be totally tax free (so I probably want to keep these for 5 years). In total, I can afford to be putting away ~ #163;800 (excluding pension) and was thinking of investing in some shares. My goal is to have  #163;35k in total 3 years from now for a house. So assuming all things remain the same I would already have. -  #163;23600 + interest in savings accounts. -  #163;2400 in work shares. To make up the rest #8230;. I have seen the website nutmeg (http://www.nutmeg.com/) which you can open an account with only  #163;1000, and a minimum of  #163;50p/m. I am considering opening with  #163;1000, and a month contribution of  #163;200 in a fairly high risk portfolio (level 8). The nutmeg performance suggests that with  #163;1000 down and  #163;200p/m after 3 years I would have contributed  #163;7210 and the median portfolio worth could be  #163;8739 (based on previous performance) #8230;obviously this could be a lot less. Is this nutmeg portfolio a wise decision to compliment my other savings? Could I do something better with the money? Advice much appreciated guys. Thanks!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes that's true. But considering the very low risk of the rest of my portfolio I think I would be able to deal with the loss. I would just leave it in there. Maybe my risk should be a little lower. Are there better options for things in which maintenance on my part would be minimal? I'm not really an expert and although maybe a little bit more expensive, is having somebody who knows what they're doing managing the investments going to be more worthwhile? Thanks!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>What are you studying? And where? A have a tips which are no brainers. 1. Get experience. If your course does a year in industry (or similar) then take it, if not, intern during the summers, if not freelance. If you can, do them all. For me, my year in industry was wayyy more valuable than my degree. I learnt more in the first 3-4 months working in industry that I did in 2 years at uni. 2. Do the extra stuff, volunteer, travel, coach football, lead scouts, be part of a team for something. If you get to the interview (or assessment days) everybody will be as good as you on paper, you need to be able to show what you did to go the extra mile and that you're a nice person. You need to come across as an interesting person. Every boy seems to list his hobby as football, if I heard that in a interview I would just discard it. It really builds character. 3. Have examples of times when you've taken ownership and accountability for things. The grad schemes are often a way to slingshot people in to management. If you have examples which support their requirements well, and they think you have longer term potential its puts you in a good place. Everything you say you should be able to back with an example of when you used that skills or quality. 4. Apply early. I applied in September 2013 for a job that started August 2014. Most of the schemes are like that for the bigger places. If you want to talk a little more about the process,and what the days involve (its pretty intense and a bit different) just message me. I'll give you my number and we can have a call if you wish even. Just let me know.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m glad you #8217;re making big steps to improve your options; great subject and at a very good uni. The whole process moved incredibly quickly for me, but I wouldn #8217;t say this was the norm. From me clicking submit on the online application to receiving a job offer was exactly 2 weeks. The process was pretty standard, see below, but usually this would take much longer. Maybe even 2 months+. Most applications open late summer, to start a year later. Application process 1. Online application a. CV b. Covering letter c. Application specific questions (in my case, a couple of small essays about the future of the industry) 2. Online test a. Numeric b. Reasoning c. Interpersonal 3. 1st phone interview  #8211; Mainly just a chat to make sure you can hold a conversation. Some questions like  #8220;Tell me about a time you #8217;ve worked in a team. #8221;  #8220;How would you handle a situation where you knew you could not deliver on time. #8221; 4. 2nd phone interview  #8211; Technical. For me this included things about programming, and various other computer science things. 5. Assessment centre  #8211; Put me up in a hotel in London for the night and the centre started very early the next morning. a. Meet and great breakfast with other applicants and senior employees who would later conduct interviews  #8211; an ice breaker really b. 1st interview  #8211; quality based, testing your morals and such, finding out a bit more about you and your hobbies, personality etc. Talk over your CV. c. 2nd interview  #8211; technical, more course and role related questions  #8211; in my case incredibly hard, but they don #8217;t expect you know the full answer, its often about approach d. Team task  #8211; a problem solving task with 5 other applicants. Can be quite difficult, but you just need to show problem solving skills. e. Online tests retake  #8211; this is just to make sure that you didn #8217;t cheat on the online exams. 6. Wait and see if you get an offer As I said for me all this only took 2 weeks. They were super organised. But for some of my friends it took months. As you said you #8217;re a mature student (I don #8217;t know how mature) but one of my colleagues who started at the same time as me was 33 and got on to same grad scheme I did. So you #8217;re still in the running for grad schemes all the same you would be for another job, and they #8217;re a brilliant way to go (certainly in finance industry, and chemistry as weird as it sounds is perfect to do so). You get a great wage, a decent golden handshake, the benefits are great (pension, share options, private healthcare), continued learning and genuine career progression opportunities. I am doing a couple of rotations in different roles to see what I like and where I want to build my career.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2015-04-18 23:44:51</DATE>
    <TEXT>I am going to get a new bike on the cycle to work scheme in the UK and I had my heart set on a Giant TCR Advanced 1 (http://www.giant-bicycles.com/en-gb/bikes/model/tcr.advanced.1/19191/77280/) but its out of stock everywhere until July. (Bit of a cock up there from Giant) I'm struggling to find anything as good as that in this price range. I'll have  #163;1000 from the scheme and I'm going to add  #163;500...maybe a tiny bit more if I have to. Any ideas on bikes with similar spec and price? Unfortunately it has to be available at a shop to use the scheme so that writes out Canyon :( * Carbon frame with internal cable routing * Ultegra 11sp * ~8kg * Nice looking would be good too! I've spent hours looking and the only one I can find close is http://www.edinburghbicycle.com/products/focus-cayo-6-0-15... Any ideas? Cheers guys!</TEXT>

Then just a couple of years until it trickles down to ultegra, and a couple more for 105 for those of us who have pockets of reasonable depth.</TEXT>

Baader-Meinhof is different because is something that you have not come across at all before, but then hear it repeatedly in quick succession. It feels weird, but when you think about it in terms of statistics, it makes perfect sense. Think how many new things you learn or are exposed to a day; loads. Sooner or later, you're going to come across something new in quick succession. Just because of all the stuff you're coming across.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>1. I boil the rice so its nearly done. 2. Fry the chopped thighs in a skillet (or wok). I use the 1 cal spray oil as you really don't need much as there is enough fat in the chicken itself, especially if you use a non stick pan. 3. Throw in a Knorr stock pot. It'll melt. 4. Pour the nearly cooked rice in to skillet with the chicken, and add a little hot water if there isn't much in with the rice. The water will absorb the stock. 5. Throw in the veg. 6. Simmer the whole lot on a low heat until its reduced and the liquid has been absorbed by the rice. Usually around 10 minutes. The end result is lovely tender chicken, and rice with flavour as well!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Just live the dream on the hills. I'm almost 80kg and being your weight on the hills would be awesome! That said do your best to put on some weight, if your riding a fair amount you're going to need loads of extra calories anyway. I would recommend GOMAD (http://stronglifts.com/gomad-milk-squats-gallon-gain-weight/) and get doing some body weight exercises to try and build some muscle mass too. You don't need to join a gym, press ups (knee press ups to start if need be), squats with no weight to start, and then with a rucksack filled with bottles of water, I'm sure there are plenty of resources online to more inspiration.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes I think that's the best way. I just need to find a speaker selector with volume controls, and impedance matching, that's available in the UK. (I don't really want to wire in separate volume controls as I'll never change them once set) Thanks!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I probably worded that poorly. What I meant is, I don't want to wire in separate volume controls in each room. But yes, I do want volume controls. I think something like this: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004C6O86A/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 amp;camp=1789 amp;creative=390957 amp;creativeASIN=B004C6O86A amp;linkCode=as2 amp;tag=geothegregee-20 amp;linkId=27RWNWGLI7OAFBSA But that I can get in the UK.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Small Garden Help</TITLE>
    <DATE>2015-09-20 14:27:34</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi guys, I have just purchased my first house, and I would love some advice with what to do with the garden. I'm a complete novice, but willing to get stuck in and learn. I have a rough idea of what I want, but no idea what I can or can't plant, what'll look good, when to plant, or what can go in planters etc. http://imgur.com/a/VTHv6 What I **think** I'd like (and please suggest otherwise if you have better ideas): * Hardy plants * Relatively low maintenance. I don't mind watering and the odd bit of pruning, but I don't want to be digging every weekend. * Plants that are going to last a decent amount of time, I don't really like the idea of annuals which'll need replacing. * Some kind of climber along the back fence, to cover the expanse of wood. Ideally that'll provide a bit of colour if possible. I presume I'd need to put a trellis or something up. * Some plants which smell good nice. * Herbs (I presume these could go in pots or planters?) * I'd love for the garden to be at least a little productive, ideally, strawberries, onions and potatoes. (Or anything else that is easy. I'll eat anything.) Some details: * You'll see in the pictures that the garden is small, but contains a shed and water butt already. * I have no idea what the soil is like * I live in the UK, in the north. Average lows of 2C (35F) in winter and average highs of 22C (72F) in the summer months. Likely to get some snow and plenty of frosts mind. Can you guys point me in the right direction for resources which'll help me plan this sort of thing out, or even just name some plants that fit the bill? It might be a tall order in a small space, but anything which makes the place look a little more natural would be brilliant. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks guys!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[BEGINNER] Blisters!</TITLE>
    <DATE>2015-10-05 22:08:44</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hey, I'm a newbie! Been trying to get in to running for last few weeks but blisters keep putting me out of action. I cycle a lot and my fitness is good, but I keep having to stop due to blisters; after even about 15-20mins. I've never got past 3.5km without them starting to really hurt. And then they need a few days to heal before I can run again. They're on the balls of my feet, slightly on the inside edge of the foot, almost along the line that the bit toe follows. I don't get them anywhere else. I've bought new shoes as I thought it could have been my old shoes (they were also a few years old), and the issue persists. They definitely fit well, this is not the problem. I've also tried wearing two pairs of socks. Do you guys have any tips? Or does the skin on my feet just need to toughen up, like when you get calluses from weight lifting? Cheers guys!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hello, I don't collect stamps myself, but my grandad is very keen and has been doing it on and off for years. Nowadays its getting very common for stamps to be self adhesive, and when he soaks these off the paper, they're often still very sticky and covered in residue. Is there a way around this? Anything to take the glue off without damaging the stamps themselves? He's complained a few times about it so I thought I'd see if you guys know the answer. Thanks!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi guys, I am looking to send an arduino nano with an altimeter up in a small rocket to measure acceleration and altitude of the rocket. I have the nano and the code working, but a standard 9v battery is probably a bit too heavy.

    <TITLE>[UK] Mortgage With Family Member</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-02-03 12:33:35</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hey guys, I'm wondering if you could shine a little light on the below situation. This is a very early look in to some possibilities, so I don't want to speak to a mortgage advisor just yet and I'm struggling to find the info I need online. I'm in the process of buying my first place:  #163;140,000 with #163;20,000 deposit, and my salary is  #163;41,000. So the mortgage is about 3x my salary. I have no other outgoings (finance on anything, credit card etc, and very good credit history.) My brother and his girlfriend are also looking to buy in the near future, however he lives in a much more expensive part of the country and would need to spend more. And with the deposit they have, the LTV remaining would be more than 4x their combined salaries. Over drinks I suggested that maybe I could help them out, and buy the house with them, something like 80/20. It would help them out, and a bit of an investment for me. But what I don't understand is: * As I've only "used" 3x my salary for my mortgage, does this mean that effectively I could potentially get another mortgage for about  #163;40k? (working on the premise that lenders typically would give a max of 4x salary) Does it work like that? Anything to consider as it would be [part of] a second property? * What are the other implications of getting a joint mortgage? We'd be paying for everything 80/20 split (deposit, fees, mortgage). Presumably legal fees would be more to set it up. Would interest rates be different? Anything else differ? * There would be effectively 3 people on the mortgage. My brother his girlfriend and me. They're not married but would split everything. So 40/40/20. Anything to consider here? Obviously there are lots of assumptions here, and I'm fully aware it would be down to finding a lender. I was just wondering if you could help point me in the right direction, or flag up any immediate blockers. Thanks!</TEXT>

I know there used to be wire models of building in all the big cities, but this now seems to work everywhere and with a satellite image overlay on it. My initial thoughts were that it was a combination of: - Some clever edge detection - Using the difference in perspective from multiple satellite images - LiDAR data from satellites - Possibly some data from the street view cars ...all fed in to an algorithm. It seems to work better in some places than others. The link above is a good example as you get see it working on the courtyards, balconies and trees.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thank you very much for your reply. This is pretty much what I expected. And as proposed I think I would be classed as being able to afford the mortgages. But of course, you never know until application. Its the amount of deposit they would want for the second, that I'm unsure of. I would of course talk to somebody in detail about the implications of such an arrangement, should the idea progress. Thanks again for the pointers. Much appreciated.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I wouldn't be giving them the money as an additional deposit (and in fact deposit isn't really the issue in their case, they have plenty of deposit, what they don't have is enough combined income to be given the mortgage), that would be my 20% of the deposit, to go along with my 20% of the mortgage, and 20% or any fees (solicitor for deeds, conveyancing etc.) or maintenance on the house from then on. I wouldn't be expecting any form of repayment from them. Does that make sense?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For my final year project, we made an app that measured driving for fuel efficiency. Android app, that connected to cars via a Bluetooth OBDC chip, and measured, speed, revs, what gear you were in, etc from the car, and also how harshly you accelerated and braked using the phone accelerometer. It then allowed you to upload your drives and scores to a website. We got the prize for best project, mainly because the scope was really wide. Plenty of research on how the Bluetooth chip works, the algorithm for calculating an "ecoScore", field testing with different cars and OBDC chips, android app architecture, database architecture, quite a few different technologies, Java, JSON, HTML, and of course ending up with a real world product. My point here really is that usually the project doesn't really matter too much, but it should be something which allows you get as many marks as possible, and the best way to do that is by following a real world process of the SDLC.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Giving Away Inheritance Keeping Benefits</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-03-22 23:26:36</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hello, An elderly family friend is currently living on benefits and has very little out goings. She receives housing benefit, council tax benefit and pension credit. She is expecting to inherit a sum of money as her sister has just passed away. ~ #163;40k potentially. Is there anyway she could legally give the money to her granddaughter who really needs it without it affecting her current benefits. If it was transferred directly to the granddaughters account, without ever passing to her account, would this be ok? Otherwise, presumably she would have to come off her benefits, until the money had been, spent away until below the means testing thresholds? How much can be given away before it becomes deprivation of capital? Any pointers would be appreciated, thanks guys!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>500g is a fair amount of weight to lose, especially if it's around the rim of the wheels. Getting up to speed should be noticeably easier, and of course that's half a kilo less to carry up climbs. They'll also be stiffer too, maybe noticeable when climbing out of the saddle. Hubs will roll better too. Can I also suggest the novatec jetfly wheelset? They're about  #163;300 on wiggle. Have great reviews and they're about as light as you can get in this price bracket.

I ended up as a business analyst in the end, turned out I much prefer that kind of thing than coding. As for technologies, Java is probably top priority, but don't forget the other things, soft skills and problem solving. The best way to evidence these is with some work experience or freelance work; in my opinion worth more than the degree itself.</TEXT>

Then work out your outgoings each month. You should have some idea on how much disposable income you've got, and how much you could save each month. Obviously give yourself some money to spend as you please. Each month, I would set aside the money for bills, food and other essentials, set aside what you're going to save (giving it to your mum isn't a bad idea) and then you'll know what you have left for the rest of the month.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's very easy to get a job. However, experience gained during your studies; internships, sandwich year, etc go a very long way to making it even easier. It'll also drastically improve your skills. A year of real world commercial experience is worth 2 years at university in my opinion. It also sets you up for jobs in other fields too. Personally, a bachelors degree with experience is more than enough to get a decent job. Of course a masters could be beneficial, but would depend on experience and area of specialism. I would definitely take up computer science again; it's served me very well. I no longer work in a computer science related role, however it opened many doors and I do use more general skills developed during my studies and time as a coder daily. I would think about where things are heading and try to specialise in an emerging field if possible. Whatever you do, try to back it up with strong business and project management experience. It's ok being a good coder, but you'll go a lot further if you're the full package. Hope this helps!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If you're talking about KT tape here, there is absolutely no scientific evidence that it does anything beneficial at all. Pseudo science like this, which on the surface appears to do no harm, often does. It's not just through smaller things (like peeling off your skin like this); it can result in people not seeking proper medical advice and potentially failing to be treated properly. The level of harm caused can been significantly worse than what first appears to be the case.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>First Duathlon - It'll be cold and wet. Tips.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-03-04 00:28:55</DATE>
    <TEXT>I have my first duathlon on Sunday. I thought it would ease me into the idea of multi sport events ahead of my first sprint triathlon in April. The weather is looking like it's going to rain a fair amount, and be about 5 degrees. What should I wear? I'm conscious it will probably be cold waiting for the mass start, but with more than a light jacket on I'll be too hot running, and then probably need to put something else on during T1. Wearing a tri suit as main item. Similarly any tips for keeping the shoes you're not wearing dry? I was thinking of covering them with a towel, but don't want the area to get messy, or to waste time covering my trainers in T1 so they're dry for run 2. Any advice appreciated!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm looking to get a Garmin Fenix 3 but I can't seem to find any details about how the multi-sport activities are stored and uploaded to Garmin Connect and subsequently Strava. When you use the multi sport mode, and press lap to move to the next sport does the watch store each of these as individual activities? And in turn would automatically upload the swim, bike and run as independent Strava activities? Or would I have to do something in connect to specifically get them uploaded like that on Strava?

The main features I am after are "normal watch looking", auto syncs to Strava and decentish open water swim. I also wear a heart rate strap and not really too bothered about wrist based monitoring.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes in August, so the weather should be about as good as it gets in the UK, so hope to go light with the sleeping equipment. Going to cut out almost anything non essential, but want enough space in the saddle pack for a change of kit, rain jacket, a few toiletries and passive power pack to charge GPS and Phone.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Here's my review of the Wahoo ELEMNT Bolt. It's perfect for this sort of thing, super long battery (and you can charge as you go if riding more than 16 hours) easiest maps to read, no colour screen, just clean black and white, routes automatically download from strata or ride with gps so no faffing with downloading using a cable, can easily navigate to a specific point just using the app. It's one of the best things I've bought. https://youtu.be/27w0yJ0M4A0</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey, I've just started a YouTube channel aiming to provide product reviews, hints, tips and other resources for the average cyclist from an average cyclist. With the idea being I'm not a pro, I don't race, I don't like to train, but I do love bikes and riding and do it a fair amount and have picked up a fair amount of knowledge over the past 10 years of riding. I aim to upload a video about once a week, and have quite a few ideas to take me through the summer season. Any feedback or advice from my first vids would be greatly appreciated! https://youtube.com/channel/UCf2CuUnV6BIVqkkSDPAWysw</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Brilliant thanks for the feedback - that's exactly where I want to peg it, either just getting in to cycling, or just not bothered about taking it any more seriously. I've got plenty of reviews to do, many of which will be 1 year plus. I like the idea of the challenges, maybe an inner tube change challenge...or something like that. Where about are you based? I'm from Poole, so do a lot of cycling in Dorset, and the girlfriend lives in bath so cycle around Bath, Bristol, Somerset a fair amount too.</TEXT>

So ended up costing me  #163;620 for  #163;1k worth of bike. I can only do it once every 3 years at my company, but some let you do it every year! As a cyclist, it #8217;s quite a big perk</TEXT>

The LG version essentially gave every even row of pixels to player one, and every odd to player two using the polarising filters - both lenses in the glasses have the same filter (in normal glasses they #8217;re different in each eye) - each player got 540p 2D.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have a condenser mic that I want to use through the sound card in my DDJ-T1 (because there's a lot of crackle when using through my laptop's line in and this is the only USB sound card that I have to hand.) to record in Ableton. I can hear it fine and it sounds great when I open through Traktor, however I can't seem to register any sound through any other app or see the bar move when looking at the audio set up in the windows settings. It seems as if the line in/mic of the T1 is not available to windows unless through Traktor (if that makes sense). Any ideas? Much appreciated!</TEXT>

It #8217;s completely unscientific, and is in no way better in terms of nutritional value, taste or cost. It #8217;s pure marketing. As for the other stuff...fair. What a waste.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m not overly familiar with the specific regulations in the US (I #8217;m in the UK) but there is a similar framework in the EU. There are similar controls and hoops to jump through to get the EU organic certification, and the logo on foodstuffs, but it #8217;s equally useless. There are criteria that need to be met, but unfortunately the criteria don #8217;t improve the end product or safety (not that there is any truth in non-organic food stuffs being unsafe.) It only improves the perception of a better product. To take an example; you can #8217;t use glyphosate on a crop and call it organic. Which sounds sensible on the surface. Why would you put something with a chemically sounding name on food!? But in reality, glyphosate is not only one of the best herbicides that we have, it #8217;s been around for decades and has been proven repeatedly and scientifically to be safe. By being organic, what happens is farmers use other, new alternative herbicides and pesticides which are still  #8220;chemicals #8221;, are still sprayed over the food...BUT for which we have no evidence of their long term effects. In addition to that you still have the same issues with yields being poorer, and no scientific evidence to show that the organic product is better.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My mum #8217;s neighbor is a massively depressed alcoholic. My mum has always got on well with her and she has lived there for 25 years. She has always had a bit of a problem, but her partner passed away a couple of years ago and she #8217;s been much worse since. She #8217;s up shouting and screaming most nights, pining for her partner. She bangs about, has a fallen down the stairs a number of times. It #8217;s a terrace and there are kids on the other side and they are woken weekly by it. And then a couple of months ago I was visiting and let myself in to mums and there was a slight burning smell. I was looking around and trying to find where is was coming from. Wasn #8217;t sure if Mum had burnt toast before going out, or it was a pump on the fish tank or something. But I go out side and can see smoke coming out of the air brick next door. I looked through the letter box and the smell hit me, and could see the hallway filled with smoke. I called the fire brigade and shouted through repeatedly to get her attention. Nothing. I then jumped over the back fence and could see her unconscious on the sofa through the patio doors. I battered the door but she was completely out of it. The fire brigade climbed through the window and threw her burnt dinner out. She nearly burnt down a terrace of house by passing out after cooking. It doesn #8217;t get much worse than that for neighbours. This makes my mum more anxious than ever.</TEXT>

If somebody has spent a shit load of money on a bike, without having ridden enough to realise that Lycra is the best attire for the job (or at least cycling specific attire is best for the job) then they obviously have more money than sense. Or have been grossly mis-sold. Whether they #8217;re wearing  #163;25 DHB shorts, instead of  #163;200 assos shorts though...or using MTB pedals on their pinerello. Who gives a fuck.</TEXT>

If I #8217;ve interpreted your post correctly and you #8217;re doing a masters then you should get applying everywhere as soon as the schemes open over the next couple of months.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Wetherspoons are quicker, cheaper, they're bigger, they're everywhere, their alcohol selection is better than any other pub and their food is great value and hits the spot. If you're comparing them to a restaurant, the food wouldn't make the cut...but if you compare them to 90% of pubs in the UK,  #163;4 #163; they're the absolute mutts.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I honestly normally can #8217;t think of anything worse than reading a book. It #8217;s such an inefficient method of communication.

    <TEXT>Agree with this 100%. I did comp sci with business, and took the non- #8220;fluffy #8221; modules for both the tech and business side. Taking those related to algorithms, data, architecture, maths, accounting and law. All the other stuff like project management, industry, strategy etc can be learnt on the job. I now work as a business analyst/architect and sit much nearer the  #8220;fluffy #8221; end of the spectrum in my day to day job, but there is absolutely no substitute for learning the key, more complex concepts. Either you #8217;ll take the real techy path and need the knowledge, or take the softer tech path and be drastically better at your job due to that background understanding.</TEXT>

At about 1930 one night the store was practically empty and a team leader was up a ladder, putting stock away. He looked left down the aisle, and then looked right down the aisle - all clear. He then let out an enormous fart. It was only then, standing directly behind him at the foot of the ladder, a woman piped up  #8220;could you tell me where I can find elastic bands? #8221;. He nearly died of embarrassment, but has gone down in history.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I did a review here, but basically it #8217;s just poorly thought through and poorly coded. Fails to sync, difficult to do basic tasks, poor interface. Garmin never used to have any competition so used to get away with being a bit shit, but now their competitors are pissing all over them. https://youtu.be/nqFTiuw83Ds</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is largely because people do degrees with no career prospects. Practically everybody I know who did a  #8220;proper #8221; degree (STEM or similar), either got a well paying job in their field, or a well paying job in an unrelated field because their degree demonstrated that they were intelligent and had real world skills. Unfortunately as interesting as history, drama, English, etc are, there are fuck all jobs specific to them with half decent salaries, that couldn #8217;t be completed by somebody else with a better degree to a higher standard.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Biology is probably the weakest of them, but the skills are highly transferable, and should be able to find work in unrelated fields very easily. The statistics, critical thinking, scientific process, scientific writing, attention to detail, proof you #8217;re not an idiot etc. are exactly what most companies (we certainly are at a bank) are looking for and would prioritise over a classics, or archeology student for example!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There is absolutely no link between Glyphosate and cancer. It has been proven repeatedly and scientifically that a link does not exist. Unfortunately, people don #8217;t like science and hate facts. Monsanto (or what used to be called Monsanto) are currently being sued by a number of people claiming that their cancer was caused by Round Up (brand name for Glyphosate) and in one case Monsanto may have to pay out a shit load of money because the courts have not listened to the experts who actually have the knowledge and have done the research, and instead ignored the facts. What actually makes this worse, is that we have a huge amount of evidence and long term studies to back up that Glyphosate is safe; more than any other pesticide. But much less about the alternatives. So by replacing Glyphosate with something else, the risk of adverse effects actually increases!</TEXT>
