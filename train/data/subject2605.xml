    <TEXT>The FAQ posted on the PS Blog today says "Yes, you can select the Output to Headsets option to either  #8216;Chat Audio #8217; or  #8220;All Audio. #8221;, What this means is that we will be able to have our game sound sent wirelessly to our controller, and if we have a comparable headset "PS Vita headset for an example" it would allow us to have to have our game sound + mic + voice all in via the headset we have plugged into our PS4 system.</TEXT>

My question is what do you guys think is the best one that you have used, and does turning the PSI down a little (100 instead of 120) would that affect it much. Thanks</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Question: If I have a 7.4, 1100mAh15c battery and I am using LEDs that draw 1 watt consistently how long will the battery last? I recently purchased the Madbull Ultimate Hopup + LED module and it says on the site "Once pluged with battery, LED module will start consume battery (1 watt.) You have to unplug the battery to turn it off." So I am just wondering how long this will last if it was just left on all day. I have a polar star with a seperate 250mAh battery for the control unit and then I have the 7.4, 1100mAH for just the LED module. Thanks!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>How? It's a polar star to start with but I have a custom extended suppressor that is built from two suppressor put together. Why? Because it's deadly to be silent. I play CQB only and when I get to a good spot I can shoot someone from 10-15 feet away and they have no clue where it comes from which makes it where I can remain in the spot without giving away my position with a louder gun.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2013-12-08 21:04:39</DATE>
    <TEXT>I currently have a 416c Polarstar and I am wanting to change the outer barrel, inner barrel, and rail system so that I can hide my suppressor within the rail system. Does anyone see any problems why the stuff I picked out wouldn't work? (I don't need a longer inner barrel or the suppressor would be useless.) If everything is right it would make my suppressor stick out of the rail system 1.5 inches or less. It would also make my guns length in half. Also how do you think the accuracy would be with such a short inner barrel? Would it be worth it? Its a CQB build.

    <TITLE>[Troubleshooting] Just put a in new PSU (NEX 1500), and added a 4th card for 4-Way SLI (4x 508's ultras) and now when I try to do a benchmark the computer instantly turns off and restarts.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2014-01-03 15:09:12</DATE>
    <TEXT>Issue: I haven't tried to play any games yet since I just got this put together with the new power supply but every time I try to run the benchmark test (Heaven Benchmark) about 5 seconds after the benchmark starts the computer shuts off/restarts. I don't have anything overclocked, CPU/GPU, and the only thing that changed when this started to happen is that I changed the PSU from a AX1200 to a NEX 1500 and now I run a 4th 580 ultra (I was only running 43 580s). Under nvidia's control panel all graphic cards show up, and I can use the computer like normal and it doesn't do this. I don't think its overload on the PSU since I was running 3 cards+ everything else on the AX1200.. I'm at work now or I would try to run just a normal game to see if it crashes.

Mag box is about $70. I could keep going but I don't feel your intelligent enough to understand it because it's airsoft related. And it's posted here because it is considered an nerf gun mod.

    <TEXT>Could a freemason ring such as this http://zales.imageg.net/graphics/product_images/pZALE1-5305375t400.jpg be used as a wedding band; I really don #8217;t like wearing rings and I want a freemason ring but would rather just get one to wear as my wedding band. I know they have wedding band type ring such as this http://media.blingjewelry.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/364x364/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/f/r/freemason-masonic-black-tungsten-carbide_fj-tur-426bp_1_1.jpg but I really like the other type.

    <TEXT>Everyone needs to get off ASGIs back, you have to understand to take some of the responsibility. They have hundred of guns shipping out each week that they have to test, none of which is ASGI's responsibility they do this so things like this so the customer doesn't get a broken gun but sometimes it happens. I work at a AT amp;T retail store and this type of thing happens all the time with phones. We will sell you, lets say a iPhone, we will get everything up and working for you but then you say your home button goes out on the phone after a week or say when you go home right after you get it, you have take the responsibility to go to apple and get it replaced, Apple doesn't pay you for the millage it's going to take you to go to their store and get the phone fixed are they? Nope. What you guys have to understand is that ASGI is pretty much a reseller of guns, they could tell you that have to send it back to Elite Force because the warranty is though them not ASGI and then you would be out of a gun for months, at least they are letting you send it back to them. They are doing everything possible for such a small company that all you guys are doing is bashing them. Like Josh said, they aren't Amazon. Take some responsibility and just send it back, it's sucks yeah but it could be worse, you could be sending back to Elite Force and waiting months for it.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2014-03-12 03:03:31</DATE>
    <TEXT>Just a heads up to everyone interested in the Wolverine Airsoft SMP cylinder(Polarstar competitor) they will retail for $390, strictly enforced. 10+ weeks until they are available and there will be 300 in the first batch. Right now there are 5 test cylinders that are making rounds all over the US with retailers, they have one week to do test, reviews, etc then they are sent back or to the next retailer. This is all the information I have for now. Once I get one of the test cylinders I will post some pictures and videos of it in action and also a review.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Since PolarStar Airsoft's "Project X" in currently in the early prototype stage of its development, we unfortunately will not be able to provide an official answer to all questions related to this project since some aspects of the system are subject to change before it is ready to enter production. However, we would like to try and answer some of the common questions which have surfaced after its initial announcement. "What is it?" Project X is a full mechanical, select fire, pneumatic drop-in system for an AEG gearbox. The system has no electronics so there is no need for a FCU, wire harnesses or battery. The key purpose of this system is to be able to operate reliably in any climate and weather condition you can throw at it, up to and including being completely submerged in water. "Does it have Blowback?" The term "Blowback" generally implies the model mimics the operation of a real firearm with a recoiling bolt and open breech. That being established, no, it is not a blowback. However, being a fully mechanical system it does have some level of recoil feedback although not on the level of a full blown GBBR. The feedback felt could be compared to what you get from a EBB rifle. "How much is it?" At this time we are unable to give an official answer on this since it is still in development. It is being developed as a sister product to the Fusion Engine with the same level of craftsmanship and quality so one can expect it to be priced comparably. "When will it be available?: No official release date is available at this time although we do hope to have it available later on this year. "Is it adjustable for FPS and ROF?" Yes, both the muzzle velocity and cyclic rate are adjustable. However, the system is self regulating so FPS will not be adjusted by simply changing the input pressure. Cyclic rate has the potential to be adjusted internally or externally. Velocity adjustments will need to be done internally. "Do you need an Air Rig?" The system was originally designed to run straight off of an SLP tank but we have determined that it will operate best at lower pressures similar to the Fusion Engine so an air rig will most likely still be required. "Can it run on CO2?" Since there are no solenoids which could potentially be damaged by spikes in pressure, CO2 will most likely be a viable option as a power source. "What does it fit into?" It is being designed to fit into the shell of a TM spec AEG gearbox. The first available option will of course be for the Version 2 and configured for M4/M16 series but we do plan to produce other models in the future. "Is it replacing the Fusion Engine?" No, it is not replacing the Fusion Engine. "Project X" is simply another product we are developing to answer the demand for an all weather, waterproof, drop-in conversion for an AEG gearbox.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's not a replacement of the fusion engine, it will be a separate product, I would say no since you don't know when this will come out, you won't just be able to change the nozzle like on the FE, etc. There are many reasons this will not be a FE replacement.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[Reddit Gold] Help on a project!</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-05-04 18:27:10</DATE>
    <TEXT>I am trying to power this display https://www.adafruit.com/product/911 plus a raspberry zero with https://www.adafruit.com/product/258 this battery going through https://www.adafruit.com/products/2465 this. Picture of the circuit: http://i.imgur.com/jhMq20j.png Battery is 100% charged when trying this. My issue is that the raspberry pi zero will boot up just fine, but the display doesn't. But if I plug in the USB cable to the Powerboost(with the battery plugged in it or without it plugged in it) the raspberry and the display power on. Now if I'm just running battery and plug in the USB to the powerboost and then unplug it after about 5 secs the display stays on.. Without the USB cable in the powerboost. Can someone explain this? I figure it's a not enough voltage to the display but it works fine when I unplug the USB cable and it runs on just battery but just won't boot up on battery only. Thanks,</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This. 100% correct. I purchased the red one from Ivan. I made no mention of making it. A lot of internet articles are showing that I made it which would be false. If you look at the original post I even say I purchased it and there are some articles that say I purchased it and others say I made it. Not sure where they get the information like the trending post on facebook "Reddit user subject2605 posted pictures which he said show a Burger King Game Boy toy from 2000. He said he made the toy operational through an emulator and a Raspberry Pi Zero board.". Never once did I say I made it anywhere. There's just a bunch of websites reposting the pictures but not reading any of the posts.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's not something I can help. Theses posts were made on reddit before it was all over the internet. I never thought it would spread around the internet like it has. Also if you read my comments on the post/s-I say I purchase it and did not make it. I have emailed most of the main websites who credit me with the build asking them to credit the correct and I haven't gotten any response. I had Raspberry Pi's facebook credit Ivan this morning after they made a post saying I created it. I also have talked to Ivan about this and he knows it isn't something I can control at this point.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2016-12-02 04:34:56</DATE>
    <TEXT>I got my NES30 Pro today and notice that that button mapping is 100% correct when browsing the menu of RetroPi and on some N64 games but other games that are on SNES, Gameboy Advance, etc are not mapped correctly- Start seems to be the A key and I can't hold dont start and select to boot back into RetroPi. Any ideas? I'm using the controller bluetooth but it does the same thing wired.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Does anyone know of any online scripts that will allow you to monitor your Pi network? I have a web server, VPN, Pi-Hole server, etc. and I want to have a monitor server where I can access to see if the Pi is online or not and tell me a little about each Pi like temp, speed, etc. I know there are website you can install software on each on to monitor them remotely but I am looking for just a web script I can run on a apache server and access via the VPN to check status of the Pi's.

    <TEXT>HOVA_HPXA would be "value" to find in the second spreadsheet and then the two times (14:38:07  amp; 14:54:45) would need to be filled in on the 1st spreadsheet after it matched the HOVA_HPXA "value" with HOVA on the first page. There will be 150+ "values" that will have to match up with the same values on the first spreadsheet and all I need to pull is the two times and put them on the first spreadsheet. Does that help?</TEXT>

Most say that it's worth it for people who have extra storage that isn't being used by them so they can "lease" it to make Siacoin. The computer would have to be on. Also there are contracts so if you are unable to keep a 9X.X% uptime I think you are penalized.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Nobody knows. This month the company is going to be releasing a new update among other things that should have a positive effect on the price. The best thing you can do is buy whenever you feel comfortable and hold. Just about every top 100 cryptocurrency has about doubled if not more in the last few months. A lot of people make the mistake in selling when they start to see it drop (panic sell) and end up losing money. About two weeks ago it hit 0.015 and then dropped to about 0.05 and is now back up to 0.015. Best advice is to buy and hold.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Logs clear after the ZNID reboots. We currently have a ticket open with zhone but what is weird is that we have tried 2 ZNIDs at the same location and multiple firmware. So based on that I would think that if it was a software/hardware bug it would be resolved with the switching of the ZNID or the firmware change. And to my knowledge we don't have this issue with any other ZNID currently deployed.</TEXT>
