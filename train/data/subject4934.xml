    <TEXT>The universe was horseshoe shaped and half was science with the other half being magic. There was a kid who could warp or something and he helped protect planets. At one point the science version of the kid(a robot) was just able to take pictures of his homework. The jist was that science and magic were constantly fighting and that the different versions of the kid would travel through a higher dimension that was like teleportation in its effect to help the planets under attack. He wanted both sides to stop fighting.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well I #8217;m not the OP who you asked but at my school, close to the middle of Indiana, we had an absolutely garbage health class. Parents were literally encouraged to pull there kids out on those days as the school would send out  #8220;sex Ed, if you want your kid to not be there, that #8217;s fine! #8221; Emails for a solid month before. The class I just finished was more closely aligned to the  #8220;chewed gum #8221; route than any form of safe sex. Literally everything I know I know from Reddit. So I have had friends that go to different high schools who say that it #8217;s better but mine is not at all a progressive program.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I got it as part of a Humble Bundle so I wasn #8217;t aiming for it. That said it has like ~250 hours into it as it can be great for the days were you really just want a calm fun thing not some run n gun. I totally think it was worth it but it can be dull. Some days all I do is water crops and talk to the towns folk. I #8217;d say four to four point five stars.</TEXT>
