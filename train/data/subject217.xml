    <TITLE>What illness you think you suffer from, that medicine have no term for yet?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2013-02-23 17:59:35</DATE>
    <TEXT>6 months ago I learned that the fear of holes in skin or anything else that i suffered from since my childhood has a name, trypophobia. Informations about it are scarce. Simply knowing that it has a name gave me a mild relief. What about you redittors? Do you suffer from anything that you think medicine failed to term yet. My first post, please be gentle :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>First of all my great condolences to all bostonians and usa Ok, down vote me all you want, as long as you understand my point of view : im a muslim, arab, saudi, WHAT ARE THE ODDS EH? Everyone knows the mass murders in Syria, iraq, palastine, purma.... Etc. Everyone knows that the ammount of responce, grief and sorrow toward a killed human in the middle east is very tiny and pathetic in comparison to a killed human in USA, UK or any 1st world country. Unlike the common mentality saying its USA and the west acts that made people killed in those places simply trivial, i think a very important factor is the type of system, human rights, people educated perception toward what killing another human being means is the reason of the different responses, In other words: it is our fault, collective fault in middle east that lead to not cherishing and percieving killing of a human as it is supposed to be. It is easy and (encouraged) here in middle east to simply blame the (WEST) for everything, there could be some factors the west is contributing to our problems, bit im sure its not the main causes, I think the beast that we are afraid of and blaming for all of our problems is after all us not them.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Saudi here, i think forcing a women to cover her entire face is ridiculous and stupid. Now a famous joke about this concept: A saudi sheikh always carry candies in his pocket, He met another arab guy, presented him with two candies, one WRAPPED and one unwrapped, ask which one to pick, the arab guy chose the wrapped, sheikh asked why?, because its covered and fresh replied the arab, sheikh had a victorious smile and proceeded explainjng how this applies to women, , same sheikh met a french guy, did the same trick, french guy picked the unwrapped candy, sheikh angirly asked why?, because i know it's shape and type,i liked it, i don't know what is wrapped in there, Sheikh angirly replied: WILL FUCK YOU THEN! YOU ARE INFIDEL AND DON'T HAVE OIL!!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In regard to (my grammar), I think you are referring to punctuation marks. Grammar can also involve punctuation marks,so you could be right. I have to admit that I have a poor understanding of it, giving the fact that English is my second language that i learned from my study of medicine. and I will appreciate it if you recommend a good source for a quick read. as far as I am aware ,(Read) can be used for both present and past tense but with different pronunciation. please correct me if i'm wrong. you thinking that reading the Quran is a (complete waste of time) is your opinion -insert The Big Lebowski meme here- and i disagree with you. I thank you for your advice, I read and will read a lot of English books,textbooks or other forms of books. finally , if your reply was to express an opinion, and to inform me to improve my future comments, then : thanks, noted. but if it was to simply insult my way of believe simply because you are irritated by my existence , WILL THEN FUCK YOU TOO YOU FUCKING CUNT!!. have a good day.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>the next day. As he entered the classroom, he saw ten stands with ten birds on them with a sack over each bird and only the legs showing. He sat right on the front row because he wanted to do the best job possible. The professor announced that the test would be to look at each set of bird legs and give the common name, habitat, genus, species, etc. The student looked at each set of bird legs. They all looked the same to him. He began to get upset. He had stayed up all night studying, and now had to identify birds by their legs. The more he thought about it, the madder he got. Finally, he could stand it no longer. He went up to the professor's desk and said, "What a stupid test! How could anyone tell the difference between birds by looking at their legs?" With that the student threw his test on the professor's desk and walked out the door. The professor was surprised. The class was so big that he didn't know every student's name, so as the student reached the door the professor called, "Mister, what's your name?" The enraged student pulled up his pant legs and said, "You guess, buddy! You guess!!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ok, that's a tough one. Please remember this is not a medical advice, it's merely a social interaction and sharing thoughts : Prozac usually IS or SHOULD NOT be given more than once a day. No divided doses are recommended, reason simply is a very long half life, if you give a patient a drug with a very long half life in divided doses , it will most likely cause an (accumulative dose), to put it simply:you are un - intentionally Increasing the dose every day to maybe a toxic dose causing or even exaggerating side effects(including of course the dry mouth, part of SSRIs anticholinergic side effects) . Your kidney condition could be the cause that you are (easily dehydrated), daily catheterization, problem filtering fluids (this could mean any of hundred conditions). Chewing a gum, making sure you take the drug WITH the food not after it, drinking fluids even when not thirsty, avoiding mouth breathing, and maybe switching the single dose to be before bed, are a very helpful tips and can help a lot. Alternatives? I'm not sure about what did you try already, but i will definitely discuss with my doctor (escitalopram or duloxetine) Best wishes for you..</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Will first, I'm an arab with many persian friends and had one or two discussion about history beside knowing a couple dozen persian words, it's not much but better than nothing. So, while you are right that khawarizmi is pronounced in persian as kharazmi http://www.eyeranians.com/archives/248 I was not disagreeing with you about how to (pronounce) I was simply saying that it is (written) khawarizmi, to make easy for people to look it up, beside, it's the international official way to write it. So pronounce it all you want, if you decide to write it in English, it's always going to be khawarizmi. P. S. :I LOVE PERSIAN FOOD!!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Psychiatrist here. Zoloft (sertraline) is not considered a controlled drug in ksa, there are two varieties of it in here and it's available in almost every big pharmacy ( lustral and riasertal) I would go with lustral if I where you. To be safe its better to have a recent (medical report) from a doctor, preferably from a governmental hospital describing the illnes (im guessing MDD or generalized anxiety disorder) in addition to the medication name, dose and frequency, to present when asked. Ksa laws doesn't allow sending and receiving drugs of any kind by mail internationally (im not 100% sure about that one).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ok, fine let me answer both possibilities : If you said yes you have critical thinking then; why would you want to torture him in first palce, use your (c.r.i.t.i.c.a.l. Thinking) to answer that, unless you are a sick pedophile or psychopath or plain scum criminal looking for ransom or something you simply won't.. If you said No I don't have that at the time, then you are no different than other animals lower than humans - keep in mind animal have rights too, corresponding to their level in food chain or whatever - so in this case you would only turture/attack/harm/injur/scare that (baby or anything else for that matter) simply to eat/defend territory /defend self/defend your babies... Etc.... You see my friend, you are still arguing with us as if we all agree with you that humans equal other animals, we don't If that is the case then why stop here, lets stop lions from inflicting that horrible (inhumane) pain and tourture and killing of deers and zabras in front of their babies!! Lets train lions and wolves... Etc to eat fruits and vegetables or other supplements to replace the meat, we have the technology don't we, poor kids starving to death from poverty and wars and diseases can wait, after all they are (no better than those poor deers) right?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I agree with all of the above. Yes, the factors contributing to such a mess is undeniable. But why nothing is done to fix it, or shall I say why so little so slow is done. Beside, the averege joe (the averege mohammed here :)) doesn't really care about the technicalities, all he/she perceives is we are way behind other nations with less resources. As Churchill use to say : spare me the details, show me the results. Thank you for the great input.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>HOLY SHIT MAN! My blood is boiling by just reading! I congratulate you for being sane and self controled so far, its a good virtu, I don't think I have half the patience you do. I advice you to do two things: Hire a lawyer, ask him what to do first. Hire a private eye, let him get the evidence more properly in compliance with the law he very well understands , go back to lawyer and ask for guidence, then act... legally. This Bitch doesn't deserve to burn your self over her, think about yourself now, Be smart. Revenge is a dish best served cold..... And legal... My best wishes for you my friend.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ok, I tried every skill I know in googling to find out an authentic resources and references in arabic about that dance, and I miserably failed, big time. So, I improvised : from the chit chat I saw in arabic forums and blogs, this is called (mallaya or dagni, dagni or dajni dajni, or the name you just used in your submission) . Majority agrees that it originated from african immigrants mainly in (OMAN) then to emirates then KSA and so on. It's considered by the majority a vulgar dance usually carried out by men and women mainly african with bad reputation (sexually). I have yet to hear any arab girl/lady or boy/gentleman being proud of it, many scholars and critics are condemning that dance and ask for its ban. Okay the fun part: I looked into youtube using the search term (african shake dance) - very naive I know- but to my surprise I found a tanzanian african traditional dance called (BAIKOKO-BAKOKO-) from an area called(Tanga) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TKmrmXmPqE amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player, just search for baikoko or tanzanian dance and you will get it. that (I believe) is the origin of mallaya dance. A quick search in african origins of oman and BOOM!! : ( Zanzibar served as capital (Sultan's court) of Oman for a while , then it went back to Muscat. 5 centuries ago Oman stretched from Baluchistan via south Arabia  amp; Yemen , Somalia, Kenya, Zanzibar. At times in early 18th century Oman also has entire southern Gulf on both shores. Most of the Zanzibaris in Oman came around 1960's after last Omani pulled out of Zanzibar. It was Omanis who brought Cloves from India and cultivated them in Zanzibar , which is now one of Zanzibar's major exports. British Actor Ben Kingsly father is originally Indian who made his wealth trading Cloves in Zanzibar before he migrated to UK.) TLDR: mallaya dance is a tanzanian dance called (baikoko) brought by tanzanians to oman through zanzibar. I rest my case... Edit: please forgive my typos and grammar, I haven't slept for 20 hours. Edit 2: in tanzania baikoko is considered a (wedding dance, it is sometime done in churches!!??!!) Edit 3: I guess someone has found the relation way before me, look at the name of the video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RH-9JyGLdw amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi Elliott,thank you for doing this: My questions to you are (and please feel free to choose what you have the time to answer): -in a nutshell,what is the current role of Saudi Arabians in this conflict? Is it a good role or do you think it's bad and should stop. Or is it both? -do you think there is something that the Saudi government is hiding on us and we must know? - what are your thoughts on some Saudi youngs who decided to go fight to the side of the free army and are not affiliated with any known jihadi group? -everyone here believe beyond any doubt that the conflict in Syria now is religious (sunna vs shiat) what are your thoughts on that.? Thank you again -</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I agree with red. You are asking the wrong question imo, depending on her current age, your daughter needs to be evaluated by a child and adolescent unit, not doctor, a unit, including psychiatrist, psychologist, social worker, and probably a neurologist or pediatrician , to reevaluate the diagnosis and then assess for the proper management. Having a panic attack at age of 6, in addition to a slef harm behavior is very alarming and is not very typical for a simple anxiety disorder. I wish her the best.</TEXT>

My question : If we can find away to understand how those parasites are working, and if we find a way to implement it, is this going to be the same old brain chemicals alterations or is it possible to use a living modified organisms/nanorobots to do the job? And how can i contribute to your crowd funding? Thanks for this AMA.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Okay, to clarify what wahabi exactly means: A wahabi muslim is a derogatory term used mostly by some (shiat muslims) to describe sunnis mostly in saudi arabia and some gulf states, it simply refere to MOHAMMED BIN ABDULWAHAB, the main sunni influence in gulf region. I'm a muslim and I don't hate anybody, I sometimes go to dubai during Christmas to enjoy the jolly times and of course the discounts :) Edit: except spiders and clowns!

    <TEXT>what you are describing is called (classical conditioning) or (pavlovian conditioning). it is different than a conversion disorder. for a classical conditioning to occur, a pleasent - or unpleasant- stimulus has to co-occur with another unrelated stimulus for the brain to associate, it usually has to be repeated a number of times to achieve the association,(think about pavlov dog experiment) a very strong stimulus can do the same with out the need of repetition ,but it is not the typical presentation, a conversion disorder, part of a broader somatoform disorders, is a condition that presents as an impairment or loss of a physical function suggestive of a physical disorder but is actually the expression of an underlying psychological conflict or need. The symptom(s) are not under voluntary control. Unexplainable physical symptoms seen in conversion disorder may include a disturbance of sensation, muscle strength, seizures, involuntary movement, or some combination of these. conversion disorder is different than malingering or feigning .</TEXT>

An example of that - at least in my place - is that confidentially can be BROKEN if there is a clear and impending danger to the client or others (eg.

    <TEXT>Okay, First of all :hallucinations are more common in normal subjects than most people think. Hallucinations by itself cannot be diagnosed as any disorder, because its simply a symptom. The commonest possible contributers of it happening is sleep deprivation, stress, and senses Impairment, like poor hearing or vision. Unless it starts to come with another (symptoms) or start to be persistent and affects your functionality , there is nothing to worry about. I would love as a psychiatrist to role the possibility of it being caused by concerta and/or muahrooms you had experience with. A thoroughly psychiatric assessment is a must also.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey, that sounds a lot of fun, I'm a big fan of simulated debates and role playing, I tell you what: save my username, send me the queries anf question and and i will do my best to answer it as a saudi diplomat as i can. Okay in regard to nuclear program in saudi arabia : I do beleive that saudi arabia have the full right like any other sovereign state to act upon its best interest, while there are now official statement in regard to saudi intent to own a nuclear program yet, I do believe it's a natural right to strive for. In regard to a nuclear weapons program, saudi DOESN'T have any active program right now "at least publicly" However, while saudi arabia stand on the bank of other states who condemn ownership of such program, it still cannot hide it's concern of IRAN and Israel owning such programs, and if those programs proved to pose a direct threat to our land, and the UN, USA and other peace keepers failed to assure saudi arabia of its safety, then I think planning to own one is inevitable at the end,</TEXT>

    <TEXT>From Wikipedia : Seizures have a number of causes. Of those with seizure about 25% have epilepsy.[17] A number of conditions are associated with seizures but are not epilepsy including: most febrile seizures and those that occur around an acute infection, stroke, or toxicity.[18] These seizures are known as "acute symptomatic" or "provoked" seizures and are part of the seizure-related disorders.[18] In many the cause is unknown. Different causes of seizures are common in certain age groups. During the neonatal period and early infancy the most common causes include hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy, central nervous system (CNS) infections, trauma, congenital CNS abnormalities, and metabolic disorders. The most frequent cause of seizures in children is febrile seizures which happen in 2 #8211;5% of those between the ages of six months and five years.[19] During childhood, well-defined epilepsy syndromes are generally seen. During adulthood, the likely causes are alcohol related, strokes, trauma, CNS infections, and brain tumors.[20] In older adults, cerebrovascular disease is a very common cause. Other causes are CNS tumors, head trauma, and other degenerative diseases that are common in the older age group, such as dementia.[21] Metabolic A number of disorders including: low blood sugar, low blood sodium, hyperosmolar nonketotic hyperglycemia, high blood sodium, low blood calcium and high blood urea levels may cause seizures.[12] As may hepatic encephalopathy and the genetic disorder porphyria.[12] Mass lesions cavernoma or cavernous malformation is a treatable medical condition that can cause seizures, headaches, and brain hemorrhages. arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is a treatable medical condition that can cause seizures, headaches, and brain hemorrhages. space-occupying lesions in the brain (abscesses, tumours). In people with brain tumours, the frequency of epilepsy depends on the location of the tumor in the cortical region.[22] Medications Both medication and drug overdoses can result in seizures,[12] as may certain medication and drug withdrawal.[12] Common drugs involved include: antidepressants, antipsychotics, cocaine, insulin, and the local anaesthetic lidocaine.[12] Difficulties with withdrawal seizures commonly occurs after prolonged alcohol or sedative use.[12] Infections Infection with the pork tapeworm, which can result in neurocysticercosis, is the cause of up to half of epilepsy cases in areas of the world where the parasite is common.[23] parasitic infections such as cerebral malaria infection, such as encephalitis or meningitis Other Seizures may occur as a result of high blood pressure, known as hypertensive encephalopathy, or in pregnancy as eclampsia when accompanied by either seizures or a decreased level of consciousness.[12] Very high body temperatures may also be a cause.[12] Typically this requires a temperature greater than 42  #176;C (107.6  #176;F).[12] head injury may cause non-epileptic post-traumatic seizures or post-traumatic epilepsy seizures in a person with a shunt may indicated failure haemorrhagic stroke can occasionally present with seizures, embolic strokes generally do not (though epilepsy is a common later complication); cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, a rare type of stroke, is more likely to be accompanied by seizures than other types of stroke multiple sclerosis may cause seizures Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) deliberately sets out to induce a seizure for the treatment of major depression. May I ask you, why would you want to have seizure?</TEXT>

I do believe you are going to have a great time in /r/psychonaut . Go give it a try. And from tens of patients i see with epilepsy, seizure is NEVER a pleasant experience.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm a psychiatrist who deals with a considerable number of addiction cases and I tell you with an evidence based confidence that cannabis is NOT proven to cause such terrifying violence or crime, As matter of fact, claims that cannabis is associated with CAUSING a mental disorder has been debunked in the recent duplicated meta-analysis studies. The only thing cannabis can be problematic is during the intoxication phase, and it's usually because of memory problems, demotivational problems and possibly panic attacks for some subjects. MDMA, ecstasy, cocain, amphetamine among others are more likely to cause such violence. This guy is most likely a schizophrenic with comorbid substance abuse who was not managed properly, add poor social and finacial support and you get a potential Crime.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I understand the terrifying experience you're having, it must be like hell, I don't know what credentials this (head shrink) you visit has, but I'm guessing she iscjust a psychologist, a will trained clinical psychologist will be very concerned and will take actions, not simply tells you to suck it up. I advice you strongly to visit a PSYCHIATRIST with experience in personality disorders. From the very limited data you posted I'm going to take a wild guess and say you probably have a borderline personality disorder, or at least I will be very interested in ruling it out first before doing anything else. If it's in fact a borderline personality disorder, it's very treatable but it needs the right mental health team and program. Best luck to you buddy.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2014-05-14 08:00:00</DATE>
    <TEXT>I had pebble steel for less than two months now. It first, I installed every popular app I hear about to see if it suites me. What I noticed is that every app with a stand alone android companion app (like pebble instant, canvas... Etc) will suck the batteries like crazy, I was very lucky if i get 3 days of battery life. Then I just got bored and uninstalled every stand alone app, and just used yweather watch face and pebble build in notifications, im now in my 4th day of battery life and battery life is still 50%. Is my assumption right? That any other app connecting to pebble besides the official one will only drain the battery very fast. Or am I simply a victim of selection bias and placebo effect?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Greetings everyone! I work as a psychiatrist and a deputy medical director in a hundred-bed psychiatry hospital, Although i have been a member of many committees to evaluate new psychiatrists, nurses and other psychiatry related jobs, I don't have the experience to evaluate psychologists for new jobs. I have been recently elected to be a member of a committee to evaluate and recommend applicants (psychologists) to work in the child and adolescent psychiatry unit. Other two members are : child and adolescent psychiatrist, and the hospital's head of psychology department (Clinical psychologist). I wonder if I anyone with experience can provide me with tips and guides on how to do my part best in that committee. Thanks in advance, and I'm willing to give reddit gold (if it matters to you :) ) to the most useful and detailed post.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hello boclaypool, I'm very glad and excited that this subreddit is evolving to be about psychiatry instead of just general advices, I'm a psychiatrist who works and live in saudi arabia, southern region. Availability of psychiatrist in my area is seriously low, to give you a general idea: less than 20 psychiatrists are serving more than 3 millions populations. I have been an advocate and enthusiastic about telepsych through out my residency time till now, as a plausible soultion for such a severe shortage. unfortunately no one here share with me the same enthusiasm. I'm wondering if your company can help with establishing a telepsych in that part of the world? Thanks in advance.</TEXT>

There is definitely an absolute true or false. But the right/wrong spectrum is a matter of moral dichotomy . Therefore, there is only strong and powerful party that proofs it's side of the argument. TLDR: if you are strong you are right, if you are weak you are wrong.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>7 hour halflife : after 7 hours there is 50% of the original dose in the body after 14 hours there is 25% after 21 hours there is 12.5% after 28 hours there is 6.25% And so on, This could get tiring so lets skip ahead a bit. One week: 0.0000192% Now it takes some time for the levels of neurotransmitters to return to normal in the brain, However the receptors are no longer being blocked. The drug IS basically gone from your system though, no new effects will appear because of action by it(Although things might appear if it were masking or treating something and they return). Some side effects last longer, but its not because the medication is still in your system - Its perhaps because the mechanisms they operate through have not returned to normal yet. Some drugs (including serequel) Will continue to act after its cleared from yhe system, simply because it's out of liver and kidney reach and is still attached to some receptors. However, no matter how much is still there it will eventually let go in a week maximum.</TEXT>

I'm from saudi arabia, I do have a commercial address and po box in new York, si I can shop from any vendor in USA. the company (aramex), handles the shipments and automatically ship it to me. I have no limits with budget, Money is not really a problem for me. As long as I get something that is so efficient and practical to replace my analog cigarettes that i got sick of, I'm okay with that. edit: here is a gesture of appreciation to you and all the sub.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Those are spot on questions, I know the throat feel of analog cig. cannot be reproduced with any mod, I'm well aware of that and I'm at peace with it. All i want is the closest possible feel and taste to an analogue, if that means more vapor then yes that's what I want, if that means more flavour, then yes thats the target. Form factor is not important for me, all I care about is efficiently and practicality, if that means carrying a ball shaped mod, I will do it. For the time being I would love to get a good stock of ready made coils and parts to replace when needed, making my own things is very intriguing, but i want to check first if it worth it. Of course i will need to buy by the dozen to save shipping fees. And thank you man for your kindness, you really are an angel, bless your heart. Edit: wow those are really very nice and sexy mods in vapeporn! I think I'm on the verge of developing a hobby in here. Especially with a mentor watching my back. Thanks</TEXT>

    <TEXT>first : welcome!, we wish you the best times. regarding the names: the main difference in here is that we tend to call people by their 1st names ,so a guy named hasan ahmed, in here we call call him mr. hasan (the first name). names that starts with abdul, like abdull jabbar, or abdull rahman, are actually one name , so we use the full name we dont just say abdull. al in some names means "the" or " the people of" or "the family of" depending on the type of the A letter (short a or long a) ,unlike in north america where AL can be a stand alone name like al gore so its preferable to use it as part of the name. sorry if i confused you even more :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The most important thing to keep in mind, is that toddlers will be excited to participate in anything their parents/close adults look excited about, even if you are just pretending. So the secret is to show excitement even if it seems boring to you. Here are some ideas i got from google : 12 to 16 months Coming to life Pretend your child's favorite teddy or doll is real #8212;make him walk, go to bed, or dance around the room. Include him in everyday activities #8212;sitting him at the table for dinner, for example, and putting a bib on him. Talking about what you're doing helps your toddler with her language skills. Act out happy and sad times so she can learn about feelings and emotions as she's developing her imagination. Push me, pull you If your toddler is pulling himself up and trying to walk, help him practice with a pushing and pulling game. Use a moveable object such as a child-size chair or plastic stacking box filled with soft toys. While he holds the edges for support, you can hold the other side and keep it steady. Then slowly pull the box toward you to encourage him to step forward. Soon he'll start to push while you gently pull. This will build his confidence for the day he finally walks on his own. Clap happy By now your toddler can hold her hands open, but it may be a while before she claps independently. For now, clap them together for her, or let her hold your hands while you pat them together. Sit her facing you on the floor or on your lap and sing clapping songs like patty-cake. These will boost her language skills as well as her hand-eye coordination. Who's hiding here? Just as he loved peekaboo as a baby, your toddler will love to play simple games of hide-and-seek. First thing in the morning, take turns hiding under the bedsheets. At bath time, use a big towel. For extra fun and giggles, you can gently prod him when he's hiding. Say something like, "Hmm, is this a leg? Or is it an arm?" Games like this show your toddler that just because he can't see something, that doesn't mean it isn't there. For a change, carry him into another room while he's wrapped up in the towel. He'll be delighted when he pops his head out to discover he's in a new spot. The magic of sound Word play increases your child's awareness of sounds and gives her the confidence to try out new words. From books that mimic car sounds to farm animals that moo and cockadoodledoo, there's no shortage of toys that can ignite your child's imagination through sound. Playing games that repeat certain sounds, reading nursery rhymes out loud, and experimenting with different tones and rhythms are other ways you can help your toddler develop language skills #8212;and have fun while she's at it. 16 to 20 months Tea party On a sunny day, take a child-size plastic tea set outside and fill a large plastic bowl with water. Pretend you've "come to tea" and have your toddler fill the teapot and pour the tea. Don't expect a dainty tea party #8212;it's likely to be a watery mess. But this fun game will challenge his coordination and he'll be fascinated with the properties of water #8212;for example, that it always flows down, not up. Block patterns This requires some concentration on your toddler's part, so it's best played when she's feeling refreshed. Use building blocks to make simple patterns, such as three in a row or "two up, two down" to make a square. Show her how to copy your pattern using other blocks. Then let her come up with her own pattern, which you have to copy. Sorting objects like this into shapes helps your toddler develop problem-solving skills. Roll it to me Balls are popular toys for toddlers. Bouncy balls are best kept outside, but soft, foam balls make great indoor toys. Keep a close eye on your child when he's using these #8212;some curious toddlers like to see what they taste like. The best ball game to start playing with your toddler is an easy version of "catch." Both of you sit on the ground facing each other with your legs apart and toes touching. You can now roll the ball back and forth to each other without it going out of bounds. Fun for building arm muscle strength and hand-eye coordination. Young collector Go for a walk together and take a bucket with you. Collect small objects that interest your toddler, like stones, leaves, and pinecones. Your toddler will want to carry the bucket, but don't be surprised if she also dumps its contents and starts again. Toddlers this age love to fill containers just so they can empty them again. Meanwhile, she's practicing her hand movements and developing dexterity. 20 to 24 months Let's dance! Play favorite songs that could inspire your child to do specific actions #8212;something with a loud, strong beat so he can stamp like an elephant, or something quiet so he can pretend he's tiptoeing past a sleeping lion. Marching to music is also great fun and easy enough for most toddlers to manage. These games stretch his imagination and develop his sense of rhythm. Balloon fun Balloons are great for indoor play #8212;they move slowly enough to be chased and are relatively easy to catch. Blow one up and tap it gently into the air. Count how long it takes to float to the ground or let your toddler try to catch it. A good game for introducing numbers and counting and strengthening hand-eye coordination. Note of caution: Uninflated latex balloons are a serious choking hazard for children. So are balloons in broken pieces. Inflated balloons are okay, but supervise your toddler closely and take away broken pieces immediately if the balloon pops. If possible, choose mylar balloons instead. What can you hear? Take a big towel or blanket out into the garden and lie down on it together. Ask your toddler to close his eyes and listen carefully. After a minute or so ask him what he could hear, and tell him what you heard #8212;the wind in the trees, a bird singing, a car driving past. This is a great game for helping your toddler develop his listening and descriptive skills. Catch me if you can Toddlers love to be chased, the object of this game is for your child to be caught, especially if she knows she gets a big bear hug and tickles every time you manage to catch her. For variety, pretend to be different types of animals, like a roaring lion or a scuttling mouse. A great game for building up your toddler's stamina  #8211; and yours!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Soultion: About aspire nautilus difficult to impossible to unscrew</TITLE>
    <DATE>2014-11-03 12:36:17</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi guys! Thanks to you and this subreddit I'm 115 days free of cigarettes smoking. Recently I upgraded to aspire nautilus with the new BVC (bottom vertical coil) And never looked back, however I found out that unscrewing the tank to refill it was a pain in the ass, sometimes I even used plier to unscrew it (i broke one using that). I'm not an expert by any definition, but I found out that if I screw the tank midway not all the way will make my life way easier, and i haven't have any leakage or any firing problem what so ever. The trick is to make sure the bottom part is still loose, and never tighten it all the way, the plastic ring is big and elastic enough to do the job without the need to tighten the base. You still need however to tighten the BVC coil really good in place. I thought to share this to everyone here, maybe it will help someone. If it sounds like common sense and unnecessary, then please forgive me. Thank you all again</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As omega said, And according to all available data (including anecdotes), the answer is no, it's not possible at all. Hearing voices repeatedly especially if threatening or condescending is very very hard and causes profound anxiety, I advice you to regularly follow up with a psychiatrist or psychologist if you're not doing that already. Best wishes to you bro, you can make it through this stressful times. Don't give up.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>the only safe way is to get reassessed again by another psychiatrist make sure to tell him ahead of time of your concern of this particular possible misdaignosis, the usual way the psychiatrist will take is to stress on important history taking points that can make it easy to spot the bipolar dsorder ,for example : family history of BMD (BMD has a strong hereditary nature) episodic nature of the depressive disorder episode ( fast onset-fast offset. dysmorphic or irritated mood (usually with impulsivity ) in comparison to low or sad and empty feeling. spontaneous hypo-manic or manic episodes in the past. easly induced hypomanic or manic episode by a medication ( sometimes called bipolar mood disorder type 3) poor response to antidepressants or frequent relapses while on the maintenance dose of the antidepressants. frequent history of psychotic symptoms with the episode of MDD . severity of MDD and frequent need of admissions to psych wards (usually due to-but not exclusive to - suicidal ideations or attempts) and many other points ..</TEXT>

(not mentioned in your post) How is the temperatures of your cpu and gpu in idle and load?, cooler working as its supposed to be? Are you certain that all the components are connected correctly to psu? I hope you find a solution to your problem, and please if you do, keep us updated.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>hi Ganon, as a fellow Saudi vaper I do totally relate to your anger, I'm sure we have one of the largest tobacco gang (mafia) in Saudi Arabia in the world, and they simply fuel the naivety and conspiracy mindset that our society is plagued with, it all comes down to money. our Saudi FDA and costumes authority are simply repeating the same bogus laughable and stupid claim for years : due to unavailability of evidence of those methods safety and efficacy it's banned. REALLY? motherfuckers? then why are cancer sticks available in 7 mini markets in my neighborhood only? why even 6 year olds are easily getting it?. is it because you HAVE (available data of its safety and availability)? I now writing this while vaping with aspire nautilus mini in ipv mini D2 with 18 mg five pawns Queenside, it's very expensive to get this in here, you need to go through some (smugglers) yes you heard me right smugglers to buy it, that's how fucked up we are in here. end of rant.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey Saudittors!!. I live in southern region of the kingdom I find it very hard to find a good quality coffee house that roast in house and is good. I recently found about roastinghouse.sa that ships through an online store, it has a good variety and an acceptable price tag. But that made me wonder if there are another options in the area. Please tell me your experiences /advises in finding a local roasting house (gulf region is not bad too) that can ships and has an online store. Thank you in advance.  #1587; #1604; #1575; #1605;  #1610; #1575;  #1588; #1576; #1575; #1576; #1548; #1548;  #1575; #1604; #1586; #1576; #1583; #1577; :  #1575; #1576; #1594; #1609;  #1575; #1587; #1571; #1604;  #1593; #1606;  #1605; #1581; #1604; #1575; #1578;  #1578; #1576; #1610; #1593;  #1602; #1607; #1608; #1577;  #1605; #1581; #1605; #1589; #1577;  #1605; #1581; #1604; #1610; #1575;  #1608; #1591; #1575; #1586; #1580; #1577;  #1601; #1610;  #1575; #1604; #1587; #1593; #1608; #1583; #1610; #1577;  #1575; #1608;  #1575; #1604; #1582; #1604; #1610; #1580;  #1608; #1578; #1588; #1581; #1606;.  #1605; #1593;  #1575; #1604; #1588; #1603; #1585;  #1605; #1602; #1583; #1605; #1575; #1611;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The two main ingredients of an e-liquid are: propylene glycol (pg) and vegetable glycerin (vg). Other ingredients are: falvours (can be one or ten, depends on the flavor), then the nicotine. Pg is mainly a solvent of nicotine and flavors, it also give you that throat hit you need to simulate cigarettes smoking. Vg is mainly the vapor and cloud maker of the liquid. There are many variations of the ratio between pg/vg , so you got 70/30, 50/50 30/70, some liquids has 100% vg and so on. Pg nicotine and some harsh flavors tends to be the main culprit in unpleasant experience for some users.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>this one: A man with a 25 inch long penis goes to his doctor to complain that he is having a problem with this cumbersome instrument and has had more than one complaint. "Doctor," he asked, in total frustration, "is there anything you can do for me?" The doctor replies, "Medically son, there is nothing I can do. But, I do know this witch who may be able to help you." So the doctor gives him directions to the witch. The man calls upon the witch and relays his story. "Witch, my penis is 25 inches long and I need help. Can anything be done to help me? You are my only hope." The witch stares in amazement, scratches her head, and then replies, "I think I may be able to help you with your problem. Do this. Go deep into the forest. You will find a pond. In this pond, you will find a frog sitting on a log. This frog has magic. You say to frog, will you marry me? When the frog says no, you will find five inches less to your problem." The man's face lit up and he dashed off into the forest. He called out to the frog, "Will you marry me?" The frog looked at him dejectedly and replied, "NO." The man looked down and suddenly his penis was 5 inches shorter. "WOW," he screamed out loud, "this is great!" But it was still too long at 20 inches, so he decided to ask the frog to marry him again. "Frog, will you marry me?" the guy shouted. The frog rolled its eyes back in its head and screamed back, "NO!" The man felt another twitch in his penis, looked down, and it was another 5 inches shorter. The man laughed, "This is fantastic." He looked down at his penis again, 15 inches long, and reflected for a moment. Fifteen inches is still a monster, just a little less would be ideal. Grinning, he looked across the pond and yelled out, "Frog will you marry me?" The frog looked back across the pond shaking its head, "How many times do I have to tell you? NO, NO, NO!!!"</TEXT>

    <DATE>2017-10-31 17:55:10</DATE>
    <TEXT>let's cut to the chase: -warning:English as a second language- Gears: chemex, chemex white square filters, baratza virtouso grinder ( 21-23 grind level), hario scale ,bottled water.local freshly roasted coffee (Ethiopian, Colombian) , Q1: i find difficulty making a flat bed coffee surface when pouring water ,so i use the spoon to scrape coffee from edges to (force flat bed at the end) ,is this okay? ,or should i slowly pour and make sure to achieve flat bed without touching the grinds? Q2: i use 300 ml water : 22 gm coffee (1:13 ratio) ,i tried the so called golden ratio ( 15-17:1 ) but to produces a coffee too watery for my preference, should i stick with golden ratio and adjust other variables ? or is it okay to try more (extreme ratios)? Q3 : the resulted coffee volume is never 300 ml in the cup ,it more like ( 260 ml ) due to absorption by coffee grounds ,should i add water to top off? or is this the norm? thank you in advance.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Arab here : I stared at it for good 5 minutes ,i could not comprehend it as a full sentences Arabic ,or even a sequence of unrelated words the context you provided is very important: location ,blue bosnian writing meaning and names. all i can be sure i can understand is the same as another fellow redittor said : the word meaning god  #1575; #1604; #1607; witch is usually written in context of full (shahada : #1604; #1575;  #1575; #1604; #1607;  #1575; #1604; #1575;  #1575; #1604; #1604; #1607;) meaning : there is no god but allah. Im really curious to know if this could be indeed written in another language that uses similar letters and even words of arabic ,like farsi and urdu. i would love to know if any of your family members or ancestors or previous resident is named amel or anel . was there an incident about snake bite in the past?or fear of snake bite in the past? finally here is a list of my ( wild and totally unprofessional guesses ) : - its a form of white witchcraft meant to benefit and treat ailment (like snake bite?) or prevent from it , white witchcraft can be believed to counteract black witchcraft. the spell was meant to treat or protect a child or children sleeping or laying of sickness on that bed. - the performer of that spell, learned how to write spells from (arab,farsi,urdu) master, while she/he couldn't write or understand that language , so she/he had to write names and purpose in native language ,he/she poorly imitate and draw a version of what she learned but cant understand, the result is poor incomprehensible writing . - this could be simply doodling and scribbling of a child or adult ,and we are just reading and analyzing too much into it - the form is definitely not (typical) of what a spell look like,however, wrapping in plastic is very suspicious. disclosure : i dont believe in witchcraft or magic,im just interested in it ,if were you ,i wouldn't worry at all, and just throw it .</TEXT>

    <TEXT>i stand corrected,im using on screen keyboard captagon is probably Fenethylline , it is a codrug of amphetamine and theophylline which behaves as a prodrug to both of the aforementioned drugs ,all three have stimulant effect. [more info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fenethylline) of course assuming what is used here is the exact drug,original company produced is very very unlikely ,but from my work (mental hospital) most of captagon users urine test shows +ve for amph. within 48 hours of ingestion.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>[link to recipe ](https://www.certainlyketo.com/keto-boston-cream-pie/) **Ingredients** **Cake:** 1 cup almond flour 1 scoop protein powder (about 2 Tbsp)  #8532; cup powdered erythritol 1  #189; tsp baking powder  #189; cup almond milk 2 eggs (separated)  #188; cup olive oil 1 tsp vanilla  #188; tsp cream of tartar Custard: 4 egg yolks  #189; cup heavy cream 1 tsp vanilla extract  #8531; cup powdered erythritol 2 Tbsp butter  #8539; tsp xantham gum Ganache: 2 oz unsweetened dark baking chocolate 1 Tbsp butter  #189; cup heavy cream 35 drops liquid stevia (or to taste) **Instructions** Cake: Preheat oven to 350 #176;F. Separate eggs with egg whites in one bowl and egg yolks in another bowl. In a medium mixing bowl combine almond flour, protein powder, powdered erythritol, and baking powder. Add egg yolks, almond milk, oil, and vanilla to dry ingredients. Beat with an electric mixer on low to medium speed until combined. Then, beat an additional 3 minutes on high speed and set aside. In a large mixing bowl, beat egg whites and cream of tartar on medium to high speed until soft peaks form. Add egg whites to egg yolks batter and fold in. Gently pour the batter into 2 8 inch greased cake pans. Bake for 12 to 15 minutes or until golden brown and toothpick comes out clean in the center. Cool completely before removing from pans. Custard: In a medium saucepan over low heat, add heavy cream and butter until the cream has bubbles around the top edge of the heavy cream. Do not boil. Add sweetener and xantham gum. Add egg yolks to a bowl. Temper the egg yolks by adding some of the hot cream mixture to the egg yolk bowl, mix in. This will bring the egg yolks up to the temperature of the cream mixture so it won #8217;t scramble when you add it to the hot heavy cream mixture. Add the egg yolks to the heavy cream mixture, whisking consistently. When the mixture begins to thicken. Remove from heat and stir in vanilla. The custard should coat the back of a spoon. Transfer the custard to a bowl and place in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour. This can be made ahead of time and just store in the fridge up to 24 hours. Ganache: Break up unsweetened chocolate and butter. Place in a bowl and set aside. Place the heavy cream in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Do not cover. Whisk the cream every so often to keep from breaking. Watch the cream closely and remove from the burner as soon as it gets bubbles around the top edge just before the boiling point. Do not boil. Pour over chocolate and butter. Whisk until fully combined. It will take a couple minutes of whisking to incorporate... be patient it will come together. Add stevia and whisk it into the smooth chocolate mixture. You can now pour it over the cake so that it covers the whole top and drips down the sides. To assemble the cake: Remove cooled cakes from the pans. Place one of the cakes on a serving plate or cake stand. Put on the custard onto the bottom cake layer and spread evenly across. Be sure not to get too close to the edge because it will spill out when you put the top layer on. Top with the second layer of cake. Pour chocolate ganache over and down the sides of the cake. Store in the refrigerator.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>/r/keto /r/ketorecipes /r/ketodessert all are an excellent places for infos. IM on keto for 7 weeks , i lost 7.5 kg so far any restaurant or grocery can be a keto last night i had my dinner from maestro pizza : chicken wings and salad, the night before i bought T-BONE steak from DANUBE and made it myself (one of the greatest benefits of keto for me was it forced me to cook and prepare my own food more frequently), oh and dont forget :EGGS EGGS EGGS !!! you can try to learn about your MACROS and start tracking it through an app or an excel sheet for BEST results be aware of KETO FLU and how to remedy it learn about IF(intermittent fasting) and OMAD (one meal a day) ,these are used to brake your plateau (when you suddenly stop losing weight ) tons and tons of information are available in the above subs that will guide you to keto lifestyle. one last very important thing : keto is a LIFE STYLE NOT A DIET don't try it for a couple of months and then dump it good luck to you and best wishes</TEXT>

    <TEXT>its okay dont worry . as long as you don't exceed 20-25 grams of carbs a day , you will be in ketosis this number vary by individual, there is an online macro calculator to calculate your macros. it's not (ZERO CARBS) diet, its keto, meaning an eating pattern that causes ketoses or sometimes called LCHF (LOW CARB HIGH FAT) zero carb dieting is virtually impossible, even lean meat has some carbs, the idea is to stay away from processed carbs, starchy vegetables, all fruits (except berries and cherries on moderation) ,rice and all types of bread is a big NO. i wish you the best of luck</TEXT>

    <TEXT>this is my personal experience ,it may not reflect on general population of Saudi Arabia. short answer is : yes , my parents and grandparents tell me stories about the times (before motawas) , conservative mindset was still there but only governed by culture and each individual religious and tribal values and convection, but no one was (or even dared ) to tell someone what he can or cant do , women could be shepherds looking after cattle from dusk to dawn alone, , no one will even think of touching them ,because of tribal known punishment for such act, face cover was optional, ,no segregations in wedding ,even during celebratory dances of weddings, there were cinemas in some kingdom cities, female singers in TV was common place, and many many others so, yes , i do believe that , hopefully we are seeing signs of civility coming back, we still have long way to go ,but we are moving on.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>i am aware of stats now and then. i was just stating a point of not dealing with a large population as one entity. i chose (now) in rough number, you chose then how about ( stop dealing with 500000 people as one entity with one attitude,believe and behavior) does this change anything? i'm not arguing -or answering- questions about (what causes conservatism ?) or (who's fault is it?), i'm also not answering a question about whether society in average was (liberal or not?) OP asked (was it "different" then?) and i answered based on that from my experience and my personal history , i know my region and its near past very well, i don't need anyone from possibly thousands of kilometers to tell me about my area or people o, and i spoke based on that. all the pretty talk you stated above does not mean anything to me ,except some speculations and obviously some hatred toward MBS, im sure you have your reasons, whatever float your boat buddy ,just don't involve me in discussion im not part of and not interested in save this for someone else arguing about the points above.</TEXT>
