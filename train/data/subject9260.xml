    <TEXT>It's a reasonable assumption...I mean it sounds like a valid comparison, but, gotta say, pal, I don't know if you're gonna get anyone confirming/verifying this for you. There's a couple steps here, you know...First, you gotta have a scrotum. Now, I know those are common, but, not just any scrotum will do in this scenario; this comparison requires a shaved one. So, next, you're gonna need to shave a scrotum. I don't know how many scrotum-havers would volunteer for this. Then, finally, that shaved scrotum's gonna need some stroking. I would think most scrotum-havers would be okay with this bit. And, after all that, you're only half-way done! I didn't get to the cat bit: someone's gonna have to get a Sphynx or know a Sphynx. Make friends with that cat, which, from what I understand about cats, is not always an immediate thing. They have to get to know you and trust you before they let you pet/stroke them. Actually, this might not be exclusive to cats, might be true of scrota as well (or, one would hope). Now, after all that, a comparison between that shaved scrotum and Sphynx is only going to be valid if both subjects were examined under the same (or relatively similar) conditions--you, know, minimizing other variables and all. Anyway, I think your question is good. I do hope you get some feedback on your query. :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Oh, sorry. You're right to be incredulous, it was not right of me to not share the video link. Guess I did make the gif just a few minutes after seeing the video and submitted to both the Imgur gallery and then shared it here right away. I was a little eager on sharing the cuteness, I suppose. Perhaps, if I'd been less so, I wouldn't have lapsed on sharing the video link! Didn't mean to upset anyone, I just liked this bit because of the little paddling feet under the water so I went straight off to gif it. I will delete if you like and would rather share it yourself. I don't like the idea of making someone feel badly especially when the intent of sharing this is to do the opposite. Just let me know. :)</TEXT>

His owner called him a wolfdog in the description of the YouTube source video so I referred to him with the same term in my title. Apologies for any confusion. Thanks for your correction.

I actually cut it the way I did because I wanted to get that hug-handshake-hug in there. I could only get that bit in there in a 15 second gif by cutting it from the front the way that I did. Hope you still enjoyed the gif and thank you /u/Escobeezy for posting the source.

    <TEXT>I just wanted to say this was nice to read. I'm glad you went ahead and wrote this. I also wanted to say that I'm sorry for your losing your tuxy kitty soon after coming home to her. I have a little tuxy, Buddy, that came home with me from the local shelter. He's a darling and I want him to break records and be the first cat to live to be several hundred years--without getting any older of course--spend a couple centuries being just under 2 years old, which is how old he is now. I don't want to ever be in your shoes and have to say goodbye to my cat (yes, I know how that sounds). Despite your grief over losing your first cat and your reservations about Kumori, I'm so glad you went ahead and got took Kumori home. The Korat kitty sounds like she has all the characteristics one would want in a kitty companion! I'm so happy that you took chance on her and it worked out so well. Thank you for giving Kumori such a loving home and being a good cat mom to her. Here's a picture of Buddy by the way: http://imgur.com/7xCQzQ3 :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Wow, TIL. Thanks for sharing the cool animal behavior info. Did that book or do you happen to have any advice on how to change animal behavior? I'm trying to get my cat to change his behavior when it comes to cat treats/reward. He's become an addict over the last month, he's addicted to these cat treats. I'm trying to get him to play and run around after any of his other toys but the only thing that gets him going is when I toss one of the treats for him to catch and enjoy. I try to only give him a few a day, it makes him happy and active but I know too many will also make him put on too much weight. What do I do to keep him happy and enrich his environment without resorting to giving him this cat version of junk food??</TEXT>

    <TEXT>All I see is a cat looking cautiously at an infant. Do cats suffocate infants by looking at them and stepping back when the infant moves? OMG, I really had no idea what cats were capable of, I also had no idea how suffocation happens. And Jesus, my definition of aww is all wrong. I have to reevaluate my life, thanks ironicbutthole, you've really changed my life.</TEXT>

This video is data collected by researchers at U of Tennessee studying hazards of railway grade crossings on bicycle safety.

    <TEXT>Just copy-pasting my reply in thread below here so more people have a chance to see: Hi everyone, Thought to reply to the top most comments that are pointing out that deer should not be fed: First, I am not the person feeding the deer, just the person who posted the gif. I mostly just saw the opportunity to post something with a fun, punny title and also share the kind of surprise aspect of animals at the door. Second, I thought to remove to post because of the concerns raised about the deer being fed, I didn't want to incite this much negative feedback BUT I'm thinking it's actually good to leave this up so people see these comments and learn from them. People may not know and hopefully these comments will instruct them otherwise. Deer should not be fed for the various reasons cited in several of the comments: it is not good for the deer, they should be fearful of humans, they should not rely on people with food, more of them will return if this feeding continues etc. Please refer to the more informative, educated comments here from other Redditors. Thank you for sharing vital information in the comments on how we can all best interact with wild animals.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks for letting us know. I did not want to click the link because I worried it was something like this. Reported the comment for being NSFL. It's unnecessary to have that comment here and the other commenter u/Heptite is right, the issue of cat+pitbull is one of poor training, not the breed.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Cassidy, dubbed "Miracle Kitten", was rescued from a feral cat colony at 9 weeks. He lacked both back legs at birth and was barely surviving at the time of rescue but, under proper care, has thrived and even gained mobility. Now, near 2 years he is living a happy life and can be spotted over at TinyKittens HQ channel: https://www.youtube.com/user/tinykittenshq/ This video from the channel is the source of the gif and details his improvement over number of days post-rescue: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im5LhVdKdhE and here is a playlist of dedicated exclusively to Miracle Kitten Cassidy: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvM3djAZtdHQ5GUXFAoZHZModajl7sL0Y :)</TEXT>

People rarely share work stories about people getting along and team-building actually going well and not ending up having to be awkward and forced on a group of coworkers. I bet you were a fierce model and your efforts made the day memorable for everyone. Then to go a step further and sharing the monetary reward with people behind the scenes or in the kitchen, I think you might be the first person in any bar/restaurant to do that. I hope you got appreciation from the folks in the kitchen. :)</TEXT>

I am the one who posted your IG here on Reddit and also on Imgur. I wanted to say unfortunately there is no way for me to indicate you as the source other than via comment on the post on Reddit. I see you've already done that via comments and so you know, I've also added similar comments pointing to your IG as well as your Reddit account. I also wanted to let you know that I posted this gif on Imgur first and in fact crossposted it from there to Reddit in the title of the post, on the right, you can see in parenthesis that the source of the gif is (i.imgur.com). On imgur, I did note the source of the gif and link your IG account. Here is a gallery link to the post on Imgur where you can see the gif has been sourced and link has been provided to your IG: https://imgur.com/gallery/rCvBiRG If there's anything else I can do, please let me know. Thank you for sharing this on IG and for reaching out to me.</TEXT>

I post what I like, just happens to be Reddit likes it to. You can tell from my post history hopefully that I also don't need to make up details like "service" dog or "foster" kittens.

The source is fuzzyfawn on IG, the IG for a wildlife specialist. I posted all this information on r/aww in the comments before responding to your comment. I post this content because I like this content, it's just something else among all the not-so-positive and rather disheartening news articles that have been on FP over the last year.

I didn't realize they couldn't be included in the comments, it was an error, I misinterpreted the rules, I thought the link was prohibited in the description on the imgur post that was crossposted here. Regardless, here is my reply: Thanks for the correction. I called her a wallaby because the comments I read said so and the source didn't specify kangaroo or Joey. Though the source does mention that indeed the joey, named Scarlett, is indeed eager for her bottle that her carer at the The Kangaroo Sanctuary in Australia is preparing.

    <TEXT>I did it as a gif because when I saw it on a news site, the title was "Grandma takes a long time to understand..." So I thought just to get the bit where she finally does get it, the "no!" and then the run and hug because that's the part that made me smile. I made a gif because of length, it took her a while to get it, not really about the fail Mad Gab game play. That said, I see your point, it's called "gab", talking is required, hearing what's said is necessary to make it really "work" and it loses all that in a soundless gif. I still thought it fit here because the part that made me smile part was her finally getting it and I thought the joy of that came across without sound. The captions were already there in the source. Here's the link to the source I used, granted not the most reputable: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/video/article-4495306/Mum-takes-long-time-understand-daughter-pregnant.html Thank you for linking the original source. :)</TEXT>

Frankly, your mother was quite cruel in robbing you of the joy of giving and then shaming you over the years for it. All children can be scatterbrained, stupid, they are children after all. That's why children aren't appointed responsibility for money often and typically have purses as more novelty and for learning, because they can do things children do: misplace these things. Your mom might have been trying to teach you to be careful with your belongings, an important lesson for sure but in this instance it was a set up. Parents, when possible, are also meant to have their child's back, not just lead them into cruel traps. What good does that do? In this case, it seems to have just made you feel shameful and self-critical for long after. It shows how wrong your mother is in her statements that people are horrified at her attempts to still shame you. They are rightly horrified at her. Having a child so eager to buy presents and give to others on Christmas would make me so overwhelmed with love and pride and joy for them. I want you to know that reading this story made me feel all those things for you. Your mother's reaction and treatment of you over losing your money was wrong on so many levels but goodness, that you wanted to give to others and see the horror in her repeat name calling and attempts to shame shows that somehow you survived her and turned out more than just okay. Somehow, despite this poorly parented moment, you remain a kind and giving person, the kind of generous child that I wish I were, that I think lots of people think they were, that I think lots of people would want their children to be. I hope you can forgive yourself and know that you did the best you could and that you deserve enjoying the joy of giving and receiving presents.  lt;3</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The source I giffed said so. The little girl's mom posted it and I was paraphrasing her explanation of what's happening when writing the title for the gif. Her post of the video said "shout out to this awesome Target employee who has an impromptu dance party with my toddler." I apologize for my title seeming unclear or presumptive regarding who the woman in the gif may be. You are right, it isn't entirely clear that she is a Target employee but, I hope this link now clears up why the title says what it does. :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>more info: Asian water monitor lizard is the third largest carnivorous species of monitor lizard in the world and the the second heaviest (after Komodo dragon). The one in the gif is 8ft long, over 100 lbs and from Indonesia. From Wikipedia: "This species of lizard is denoted by the blackish band with yellow edges extending back from each eye. These monitors have very long necks and an elongated snout. They use their powerful jaws, serrated teeth and sharp claws for both predation and defense." This is from therealtarzann on IG. :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's related to the Komodo but a different species from it. Komodo is much larger and has different coloring though these are often confused. This guy in the gif is being cared for at an animal sanctuary by a wildlife specialist. There is nothing to suggest he is illegally trafficked as he is being cared for by a certified zoo/nonprofit institution by qualified wildlife specialists.

    <TEXT>Just wanted to add to this concerning this particular gif. Dad lost his best dog pal two years ago. The puppy was a long time coming following a period of grief. The puppy adoption from a shelter was planned and discussed and a decision for the whole family. Christmas just happened to be the concurrent occasion, that's why the dad is all the more surprised at receiving the puppy as gift. The recipient and his family is willing, able, and have waited and thought about this new addition. More info from the source on twitter samilanham. :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Please search for video. FB links are not allowed on reddit comments. She's 8 so at first there's some misapprehension as to what her mom is trying to tell her regarding who is pregnant. She understands eventually though that it's her mom that's having a baby. I just spliced/edited into a gif the bit where she finally understands and jumps for joy. :) If someone knows sign and watches the video perhaps they can tell us all what all she signs to her mom once she understands the news. EDIT: it's just one baby! When I first saw this video, I thought it was two given the two sonogram photos present (and also because the girl says "two babas") but having read a news article about the story, it's in fact just one baby. The two sonogram photos are of the new baby and the 8 year old girl herself when mom was carrying her. Mom was just doing a comparison to better explain to the girl. Apologies to everyone but please note my mistake in the title due to my own misapprehension (and because I do not know sign language): it is just one baby, not twins as the title incorrectly states.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Please search for source, FB links are not allowed on this subreddit. Also because in my gif, there's a point where she's signing and asking questions to her mother in sign language. She's signing because she's deaf. Yes, being deaf is considered a disability but in this case, it's also a factual detail that explains what is happening in the gif. That's why I mentioned it in my title. Additionally, I think the source mentioned the girl was deaf because in the video you will note that there is some misapprehension by the girl as to what her mother is telling her and they sign back and forth. Think the mention of her being deaf was to explain that part of the video. I do agree with you though, the reaction is just as joyous whether the girl is deaf or not--and that's exactly why I giffed that specific part. The joy is expressive and easily understood with no words/sound. That's why I felt that it would make a perfect silent gif. :)</TEXT>

I don't know sign and the two sonogram photos confused me. One is of the girl herself when she was in mom's belly (8 years ago) and the other is of new baby on it's way. It is not twins.

    <TEXT>I thought two different angles to see each baby but then the more I thought about it, the more I figured to double check and went to find an article and confirm. Turns out it was just the one and the confusion came from not understanding that the mom was showing the daughter the sonogram from 8 yrs ago (the daughter herself) and the new baby's sonogram. Seems the daughter was confused about the same ("2 babas") as I was and it took us both some time to grasp what mom was telling us. :)</TEXT>

I'm just plum happy that y'all seem to like the content as much as I did. Thank you for the thank you. :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi there, am not the person in the gif. Just the gifmaker/poster. From source, what I can relay here is that indeed there is a connection/the crow has placed a great deal of trust in it's human. It's a result of a feeding and caring for it by the person in the gif over a decent hunk of time. Reddit/ r/aww rules don't allow links to sources that are non-famous (only those w/ a wiki). I don't want to dox anyone though this video is public on youtube and can be found easily. I'd suggest reaching out to the owner via YT. If anyone in need of source has trouble finding it, please PM me. I'm not trying to keep source from anyone or not give credit, I just want to use discretion and abide by the subreddit and reddit's overall rules. Thank you. :) EDIT: I see someone else has linked source for this gif in the comments. Fine by me, I just didn't want to do it given rules re doxxing and links to personal pages of people that don't also have wiki's. Suggest you contact the person on YT directly.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>~~PM me please~~ so I may link to the designer's page/source. I'm not trying to keep source from anyone but I think it's against this subreddits rules to dox anyone by linking personal social media pages. I mentioned it in another subreddit where linking source is allowed, I just want to abide by the rules that say non-famous people who don't have a wiki shouldn't be linked as it may dox them. :) EDIT: Maybe wasn't the best idea on my part to say "pm me please" b/c wow. I'm so happy folks like this and know this is great for the designer but it's quite a lot of pm's to reply to. In case I miss a message and fail to reply, please check the crosspost of this gif in r/oddlysatisfying as that subreddit allows source links and you'll find my comment for the source on the designer's page where I found the video which I giffed above. Thank you. :) EDIT 2: Lots of messages, more than I can reply to. Please see the crossposts in r/oddlysatisfying and r/INEEEDIT as source links of personal social media pages are allowed in those subreddits. Here are the links: https://www.reddit.com/r/oddlysatisfying/comments/7oqs5t/led_cube/ https://www.reddit.com/r/INEEEEDIT/comments/7or0f0/led_cube/ This reached a far quicker rise than I anticipated and while I am thrilled folks are interested, I am unable to reply to all at once. Thank you. EDIT 3: Looks like the designer has been brought to reddit within hours. Everybody please see comment in above thread for more info on the cube. Please direct any further queries to /u/zzzaurak :D</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's been crossposted in like 5 other subreddits by others since I first put it in these two subreddits. I thought it was satisfying as well as just being a gif. Also, gifs has rules regarding giving source so as not to dox anyone who is not famous by linking their personal social media pages. Oddlysatisfying allows such links, I also thought it fit here so there would be at least one place where people could find source. Upvote whereever you want or not at all, up to you. Thanks :)</TEXT>

This K9, named Bronx, has served on the SWAT team and then the PD for 8 years. Not sure if it's "forced",nothing seems to imply it was, the dog isn't sick. I think this is the same kind of thinking that has people retire at around 65. 2.

    <TEXT>Hi there, I'm the person who found this on twitter and posted it. I noticed these concerns in the comments in the first hour and checked with the mods and while the post doesn't need to be removed and fits within r/aww's content guidelines. Though, seeing so many comments and concerns made me want to initially take it down then thinking better of it, I think it's okay to ask these questions and people be informed about animal habitats and this facility in particular. It is the Showa Shinzan Kumabokujo (Showa Shinzan Bear Ranch) in Hokkaido. I personally didn't initially take note of the habitat, I don't frequent zoos or know much about bears. The thing that made me aww over it was the fact that they were interacting with the visitors by waving. From comments however, it's clear that this is just them trying to get food. This is uncomfortable information to have but I think it's important for people to know. I hope people read the comments and learn from them. My thanks to all the commenters from questioning and observing and informing the rest of us regarding what's really going on here and why it's less than ideal. :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Whether you believe me or not is fine. You don't have to believe me but for me, as a redditor and not just a poster, these comments provided new information. I didn't know this about bear enclosures or the fact that they are solitary animals before reading the comments here. I don't know if I would have learned this elsewhere. Perhaps this is true for other people who see this post as well. Screencap of message to mods: https://i.imgur.com/3aAVYDK.png Also, if people don't like it, they can downvote. I'm not making anyone upvote it. If this got no points, that would still make the comments here important for others to see and that's why I think it should stay up. You are welcome to report it and ask mods to remove it if it offends or bothers you and you are welcome to comment as you like. Till then, the more the informed among us tell the rest of us here, the better. Not all of us know this information. I think r/aww and those here is a community of animal lovers, to truly love them is to know the bad and the good and see what we can do to change the bad. First step to change is to be informed and my thanks again to those who know more to tell us what is important here for the rest of us to know.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I am no expert on them and didn't know what you share about them. I just noted one walking over in front of the other in response to the camera, to me it looked like he was investigating if it were a camera. The gif is the latter half of the source and in the first 20 seconds, one of them walks over nearer to the other https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9NL940SVRI Unfortunately, I have no idea how big the enclosure is or what distance one came to get nearer to the other though I think given the info indicated in the description of the YT source, you can find out more and find out. I apologize if the content in some way shows something wrong with their habitat but I was uninformed of this and if nothing else, your raising these questions lets me know more about chameleon habitats and behavior.

    <TEXT>In some places, yes it is because it's amputating the cat's bones and that's inhumane. Cities have passed their own local laws making it illegal. Most major cities in California have banned it. New Jersey I think was the first state to ban it state-wide for wild cats. New York State had a bill in the Senate last May to make declawwing illegal for all felines. That's the extent of my knowledge, i just know basic stuff about it regarding the US, I have no doubt that other countries and local governments worldwide have also passed laws making it illegal.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I agree with your sentiment that this seems invasive, disrespectful even but I also think sometimes moments like this getting documented reveals something about the human condition. I see this man and I feel his grief and feel an empathy and I am relieved his sweet cat is there with him. I know we cannot compare one man's pain to another but I understand something about it, it makes me feel something about my own humanity, about tragedy. Life has tremendous sadness in it, I wish it didn't. I don't want anyone to hurt this way but this exists and there is something fragile and real documented here. By not viewing this, it won't make this man's pain and grief any less but seeing it makes me feel for my fellow man and maybe that's why it is documented, so that we see the tragedy that is inherently a part of life. I don't know, I don't know if any of that made any sense. I just wanted to say what it evoked in me. :/</TEXT>

Here's an album of images including a before/after shot https://imgur.com/a/j1AD8 and a news article: http://www.fox13news.com/news/kentucky-grandson-restores-grandfathers-1957-car#/ Please note I am just the giffer/poster. Not the person who did all the work. Don't want to dox anyone so please refer to article for further info. :) Edit: Forgot to mention the grandson did all the work himself including..."metalwork and restored the whole frame, interior body and underbody, built one off custom exhaust, rewired the whole car front to back with brand new up to date wiring and fuse panel, and full Rockford stereo, added vintage air AC, converted the car to rack and pinion steering, power disc brakes, added sway bars for handling, and all tubular front suspension and then built a healthy 358 SBC on his back patio, with Fitech fuel injection, nice comp-cam and aluminum heads. Soundproofed the interior before installing all new custom interior, restored the trunk area, added some sick custom billet wheels (18x7 front and 20x9 rear), and slammed the car down on the ground with five inches of drop in the front and four in the rear. He replaced every nut and bolt with new, and added all the billet interior accessory #8217;s custom steering wheel, to match the wheels on the car, and added all new chrome front to back and dash restoration." more info and pics on IG: cambo_built :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Because they are in a zoo and there is something sad about zoos. I know I'm the OP but I too noticed the setting and it makes me feel somehow sad too. I posted it because I thought perhaps it's important to see what kind of life our human actions impose on the other species on this earth. Perhaps it's good to question ourselves and resolve the sadness we feel when we see this by, in future, letting animals be where they belong, undisturbed. I don't know, I just wanted to say, I hear you on the sad feeling, I feel it too. Edit: /u/Potatoprincessa in the comments below mentioned the importance of zoos. I don't want my comment to overshadow this. These facilities exist for a reason and are fundamentally there to educate and help humans learn how best we can coexist. Zoos are where most of this type of learning and research happens by experts in the field. Those working at zoos spend their life learning and caring for the creatures under their charge. My comment above is by no means meant to undermine this, I just was sharing why I too felt the initial pang of sadness. My intention was not to imply that all zoos were somehow prisons for animals or that zoos shouldn't exist, rather I was just saying that I too felt an initial sadness about it. That most definitely is in part due to the fact that I am not informed of all the benefits of zoos and certainly not thinking about them in the initial in stance I see an image of animals in a zoo vs when I see them out in a wild. In my own experience, I know I wouldn't see them at all were it not for zoos. We learn because of these facilities and for that learning, I am grateful to zoos and those that work towards the best care and conservation of these animals. :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not all of us are aware of this kind of information. Clearly, from your statements even the owner doesn't know how to properly house an animal. I think your comment is important though, far more notable than what's happening in the gif. Thank you for informing us all that the animal is doing this because he is confined in a small space, as someone who is not at all familiar with rabbit care/housing, this was pertinent information for me. I'll message the mods and ask whether given your comments, the gif still belongs in r/aww. If not, I'll delete or they will remove. However, if they think it is okay to leave up, I would leave it just so people can see your comment regarding the animal's behavior. Thank you.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>And I genuinely appreciate your taking the time to comment. I know it's not something I want to hear, that the animal is in fact being poorly housed and that's why it's doing what it's doing but as an animal lover, I'd rather be informed even of it than not. That way I can question it when it when I see something like what I see in the gif. By the way someone crossposted this gif in a different sub and commenters like yourself raised the same issues. A petition has been started https://www.change.org/p/cincinnati-spca-end-the-cruelty regarding the care/housing of this rabbit as a result of this gif and the other comments on the person's FB you mentioned. So, thank you again for raising these issues, I'm not sure what the result will be but now that the problem has been pointed it out, it looks like it could lead to an intervention that could help make sure the animal finds a better, more apt carer/home.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thank you for the clarification. I really wasn't sure and went back and forth on it. I figured go with the comma because a comma can also be used to separate two clauses. As in "No" (don't pet me) and then "thank you" just as courtesy. So, I went with the comma. Appreciate the help though, I've saved your comment. Your examples are very helpful and clear, I'll refer to them if I'm unsure comma or no comma again in future. :)</TEXT>

Thanks for sharing this, the only reason I didn't include the FB source is because certain subreddits don't allow FB links in the comments (for example r/aww where I posted this video first, there FB links are considered doxxing).

    <TEXT>I did a search and yes, indeed it was posted a few days ago with a title referring to this. The comments on that previous post proved that it was mistitled/"clickbait". Actual story is that the dog here, Monty, was never abandoned. That is his family. A fire due to arson destroyed the family's home/business. The dog was with the family (who were away at the time the fire took place) the entire time. source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TXOrmKSWO4 At the time of posting this gif, I was not aware that it had been shared on reddit with misinformation in a different subreddit. The reason why my title is so different from the previous gif you are referring to is because the first one was inaccurate/incorrect as the comments had revealed on the previous post of this gif (the gif subsequently was deleted). The title I gave this post is based on the information I gleaned from the source video title/description. Hope that clears things up as to why you are seeing this same gif again. :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Think they were just a trial. The vet techs are working with limited resources to put together a wheelchair. More from the FB page: "He was brought to us by a Good Samaritan who found him on the streets, abandoned by mom, unable to walk. He does have feeling in his hind end which is a good sign and we hope to rehabilitate, treat and eventually find him a good home. Some of our very dedicated technicians went digging through old toys they had and made him a make-shift wheelchair that allows him to finally run. We love this little guy and can't wait to see what the future holds for him." I am not linking the FB directly as social media links are not allowed on this sub but it should be easy enough to find more info on the web. Though hopefully the above is sufficient to answer your question. :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is Zeyna, she was rescued by her human (Osman Kaplan) after a dog attack, her front legs had been broken/severely injured. He immediately took her to the vet, she had surgery to amputate the injured limbs. She's happy and healthy but has since has had trouble eating, she tends to fall forward on her face. So, he built her this special feeding tray/table. Here she is with her human: https://i.imgur.com/5EsK0FQ.gifv</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I see your point but I think that would be a very difficult thing to do. To decide that the animal doesn't deserve help. The backstory here is the person who found the cat saw that the animal was in distress (attacked by a dog) and took Zeyna to the vet where she had immediate surgery. Thereafter the animal seemed happy and healthy and I don't think he continuously let the cat struggle while eating. The table was built so the cat could have better luck eating on her own. Prior, her rescuer/carer had to help hold the food up or help feed her. This is so the animal feels more independent. In my opinion, when there is a simple way to improve the quality of life of some other living thing, it would be more cruel to not to do something. Seems the cat and the man who rescued her have bonded: https://i.imgur.com/5EsK0FQ.gifv Having seen this gif of the two of them I think biases me against your comment, him saving the cat/keeping the cat alive is anything but cruel.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The source website on this is in Turkish but what I can gather from the FB (only reason I'm not linking here is b/c FB links in this sub aren't allowed) is that some sort of assistive wheeled appendage will be considered. Difference however with Max (he is the kitten in that gif you reference) is that it's his hind legs that are paralyzed, with Zeyna it is her forelimbs. Zeyna's case is more challenging because wheels may inhibit much of what else cats use their forelimbs to do. Zeyna's still growing and she's doing well as a T-rex kitty. The person caring for her cares for other handicapped animals and is caring for her under the guidance of a vet. From what I can gather from their page, they are doing what they can that is best for Zeyna as she grows. Hope that helps answer your question. :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>^ By far the dumbest thing I have ever read on this site. He's a guide dog, he is of vital importance. The dog being there is not out of someone's arrogance, it is their necessity. Those allergic have tools to help them cope with possible exposure, people have a degree of personal responsibility to keep them from being exposed to things that can cause harm out in the world. It is the responsibility of those that know exposure can cause them harm to protect themselves, carry an epi-pen, stay away from where the dog is etc. You don't walk into oncoming traffic and say no one should drive because people can get run over, there is a degree of self-responsibility when you put yourself in harm's way.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I just wanted to apologize for the other comment I saw in this thread. You are doing nothing wrong by having your service dog with you and your reply to the other commenter in this thread showed a decency and restraint that I could not muster. I think it is because you have likely encountered that kind of reaction/comment to having your service animal with you in the past, experience I suspect has enabled you to give informative and polite responses. I am glad that there are airlines that accommodate your needs and I am grateful that you have this dedicated animal with you on the plane, I can see he is "on duty" in the above video given how he is positioned and resting on your leg. Good luck to you and your dog.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I did not read your initial comment this way at all. To me, it was your comment not the op's that came across as "who cares about people with guide dogs, they shouldn't fly because they have dogs." I think I misapprehended your intention and you may have misapprehended the op's. I appreciate you stating here how you interpreted the op's wording--though in my opinion, I didn't see anything in op's wording that implied they didn't care about those with allergies--nevertheless, if that's how you interpreted it, that's fair. Thank you for going back and stating what you meant to express. As a third party reading both comments, I apologize for responding to your initial comment as I had. I did the same thing with your comment that you did with op's; we both assumed there was callousness implied when there wasn't.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hello, I am the OP! I found your video on a blog that had a whole article about you and your son. Thanks for sharing the YT source and congrats, Reddit loves your video. Just fyi, in case you are wondering, I wasn't sure of linking a personal YT page as source (I messaged the mods to ask if it was okay: https://i.imgur.com/xSjaErM.png) and that's the only reason I didn't link your video here sooner. I'm glad you did link it because as you can see from the screencap of the message, it's allowed in this subreddit! I hope the success of the video on Reddit brings you lots of subscribers on your channel and lots of clicks on your video, I am sure you will be approached in no time for licensing this. Much success with it all ! P.S. I posted this on Imgur as well (YT source is allowed there so I provided it on that site). Here is a link if you want to see all the great comments: https://imgur.com/gallery/pmMAAr6 :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>He was signalled/instructed by the girl/the person he supports that to "relax". In this moment, he was "off duty". You can tell by the way she pulls his leash and signals to him with hand gestures how he may approach Minnie but in that initial exchange it was the leash and how she had "relaxed" it that let him know that could just be an off-duty, regular dog when meeting Minnie. I am not sure that this sub allows direct IG links but source is levi_theservicedog on IG and you can read the woman's explanation for more information as to how that leap onto Minnie happened and indeed it is not service dog behavior (though in that moment, he was not a service dog). Hope that explains it somewhat. :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>He has regular physical therapy to get feeling back in the hind legs. I am not sure FB links are allowed on reddit but there was a dodo article on him. The bit of dragging you see is due to the muscles there twitching and regaining strength/control (or so that's what I was explained when I inquired). It is definitely something we are conscious of. Here's more about him https://www.thedodo.com/water-therapy-dogs-2081241463.html edit: Even more gifs/pics I took of Eddie Milo: https://imgur.com/a/WRokE :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>He can indeed move them...a little. He's slowly regaining the ability to move them, he's been in therapy and we've got progress. We check the dogs pretty frequently, every hour really when they are outside and especially Eddie Milo b/c he's so liable to get hurt with that added bulk but he doesn't have snags and with proper care in the surroundings and watching him, in my time I've not seen him get a single injury. Here is some evidence of his movement, therapy sessions that are responsible for those slight hind leg movements: getting nerve stimulation therapy https://i.imgur.com/7VBllyc.gifv and water therapy: https://i.imgur.com/7VBllyc.gifv And yes, at that given moment, he's just too excited to care that he's dragging a bit. :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I just wanted to say from one cat dad to another: what I saw was your love for your cat. That's all. Sorry you got some heat from other redditors. To me, it's pretty clear this wasn't a very common occurrence b/c if it were, you wouldn't film it. It's my personal view that the stuff people tend to film and share on reddit is the stuff that's unexpected and extra-ordinary. Based on this, for this here redditor, there was never a thought that you risk your beloved animal's life on a regular basis or were being reckless with the animal. Counter to the redditor that may have found the video provocative, there was this here redditor who saw something relatable in great joy a cat dad feels when his cat buddy chooses to trust him enough to fall asleep in his arms. Be well, give your cat some pets from me. Here's my Buddy, he's my everything too http://i.imgur.com/SEAl8If.jpg :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>https://i.imgur.com/Nl1WVrF.gifv Rest well, friend. :) Edit: folks, just to clarify I'm just the giffer/poster. I am not the person in the video. Source is stroshinesstudsandbuds (reason I'm not including the direct links is b/c social media links to non-famous IG pages are not allowed in this subreddit). Please check out the page to see the whole video if you like though unfortunately, that's all the petting that one video showed. :/</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There are so many people that seem so desperate to know if she got pets. I felt the same as they did and just wanted to sate their wish by posting the second half of the gif. Also, I'm not just a poster, I'm also just an ordinary redditor and I feel like if I left a comment, I'd appreciate a direct reply. Especially in this case where I can reply to comments with a gif of a dog getting pets. :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi! I'm the giffer/poster. I found this video on your IG. Your cat is adorable. My cat does the same sort of thing but he does this with pens. Here he is watching me discover his stash under the sofa: https://i.imgur.com/P1a95T4.jpg P.S. I also posted your video on Imgur where it also went to FP: https://imgur.com/gallery/m7ZCpUb Just in case you are wondering, you can see on the Imgur post that I did credit your Instagram page as source. Direct links of Instagram aren't allowed in certain subreddits so rather than link directly, that's how I credited. Hope you get tons of followers from this and thank you for sharing such a great video. I hope you will share more in the future. :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's magnetic slime made with iron oxide (but could be some other ferrous compound) in a petri dish. They stuck a shell on their and somewhere on the side (out of view) someone is pointing a magnet at the slime so it looks to be moving.

    <TEXT>more info: This happened in San Antonio, Texas a few days ago. Video was taken by a person whose house is at the end of the cul-de-sac. The woman recording warned the dumper that this is illegal and there are massive fines but the person still dumped the dogs and drove off, a person sitting in the backseat even flipped off the person taking the video. The person taking the video contacted Animal Care Services (ACS) and shared this video with both ACS and law enforcement. ACS posted the video on social media and several news outlets picked up the story. Law enforcement helped identify the owner/dumper and the rest of the car passengers. Apparently the internet shaming made the dumper reevaluate, before getting arrested/fined for animal cruelty, she arrived at ACS herself to give a statement and formally surrender the dogs. She again came back the next day with another dog to surrender. ACS are nonetheless working on filing multiple animal cruelty charges against her and the passengers in the car. As for the dogs, the public outcry on their behalf was tremendous. All the dogs she abandoned were put up for adoption, two have already found loving new homes. https://www.mysanantonio.com/news/local/article/Video-of-woman-abandoning-dogs-draws-outrage-12845206.php</TEXT>

    <TEXT>more of the story: Noelle, the mom dog, was dumped at a kill shelter. Someone had dropped her off, claiming they had found her as a stray. She had obviously just given birth even though she was emaciated because she had obviously been feeding her babies. A few days later, a highly suspicious ad was spotted on a buy and sell page, which included a photo of Noelle and her puppies. The poster claimed that Noelle had passed away since giving birth, and that they were selling the puppies. On advisement from authorities, K9 Krusaders, the animal shelter that rescued Noelle, negotiated a mass purchase of the remaining 8 of her 9 puppies that had not yet sold. They were estimated to be barely 5-6 weeks old, far too young to be separated so suddenly from their mother. Since then the puppies have been weaned and adopted into forever homes and Noelle found a loving foster family.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Take it easy, buddy. /u/loverofreeses seems just concerned for the cat. I don't think they were raging necessarily. They didn't even use an exclamation mark in their comment and they conceded to /u/cosmoboy's informative response. It happens, people get charged up about animals. I personally didn't think it was THAT clear it isn't someone's home. The person may or may not be wearing some sort of smock/lab coat given the white sleeve. It may indeed be a lab coat someone wears at work at some sort of animal facility. I actually didn't notice what they were wearing or the lab supplies--what look to be boxes of gloves--in the background till you pointed it out. Sometimes seeing a cute animal can draw focus and distract from whatever else may be in view. Maybe letting people say whatever they like gives the rest of us a chance to learn from the replies of others. Thank you for pointing out what else is in the gif to help us all discern context.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Note from DEC source: The shivering is a reflex, its how warm-blooded animals respond to cold. His little body is warming up to maintain homeostasis by shivering. The shivering didn't last long b/c the animal was returned to the winter den, out of the direct cold. There were a total of 4 cubs with a mama black bear in the den. Mama bear was sedated so all four of her babies could be tagged. The tagging allows wildlife staff to continually track data to make sure black bear populations are stable and individual bears are healthy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's crossposted off my personal user page to this subreddit, yes. It actually just happened by accident. Apparently, now with the "new reddit", when you submit a gif in r/gifs, the submission defaults to be submitted to the user's page, in my case, "u/subject9260" instead of "r/gifs". I just actually learned this was the case this morning when making this submission. I thought I was submitting to r/gifs because I clicked "submit a new gif" and was in the r/gifs subreddit but then the window opened and I didn't notice that it was defaulted to "u/subject9260" instead of r/gifs in the drop down menu where you select which subreddit you want to post in. Once I noticed it was just on my personal page and not in r/gifs, I just crossposted b/c "old.reddit.com" still has an easy to find "crosspost" link; I don't know where it is when looking at a post on the new reddit. So, there you go, that's why the crosspost r/gifs is off my own personal userpage. I hope that explanation was clear, it was confusing for me too when I first noticed what had happened. :/</TEXT>

PM me, I'll be happy to give a link but fair advisory: the only sound in the video is that of the human's voice. No real sound from his tippy taps b/c he's still small and his paws/claws don't make a noise against the wood. The dog tag on his collar does make a jingle though.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi there, thanks for your comment. I would recommend contacting the CPDT-KA, CTDI dog trainer that posted the original video on their IG: pawsitivedevelopment (I'm OP but not the person featured in the gif, you will note I mention the original source in my above comment). I think they'd be able to help answer your specific questions. Also, I want to say I'm glad you took the opportunity to ask. That ask in and of itself can be daunting in a way. No one should have to live with extreme anxiety/panic disorder and I'm really proud of you for using your diagnosis to empower yourself and find ways that will improve your quality of life.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Credit for suzume is embedded in the gfycat link. Goes directly to the post on IG. Just under the post itself on gfycat page. Click the title. Most subreddits including r/aww do not allow direct links to social media pages. This is why it's not listed in the comments (the only way to give credit on reddit is in the comments, it cannot be in the post, r/aww doesn't allow watermarks for social media). This is why I use gfycat, so credit is married to the actual uploaded link that I shared on reddit.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>OMG, thank YOU for this comment. Thanks for informing us all what they are. I'm so glad your grandparents shared their love of scuba with you and their other grandkids. It's understandable why your grandmother loved these guys. We didn't dive or anything like that but my dad once got my sister a few goldfish. One turns out was a koi and kept growing. My family loved her. We got her a bigger and bigger tank--spent 12K to have one custom built. Totally worth it. It took up a whole third of a room. She had other fish pals but it was clearly her home. She would sit with mom every morning and have tea, follow dad's finger. Sometimes she'd pick up gravel in her mouth from one end of the tank take it to the other. She lived near 20 years, was a family member. I miss her so much. Your story about jawfish reminded me of her. Thanks for the great share. By the way, we called her just "the fish". All the other fish were "the other fish".</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Aww, a ferret called "the weasel". Now that's perfect. I have a cat now, Buddy, got rid of his collar after the first few months and now he just walks the apartment all naked like your weasel did. I wish I knew about the weasel being underneath the kitchen cabinets sooner because once I thought I'd lost Buddy and searched the whole house before I noticed the space behind the refrigerator was just wide enough for him to go through. I realized he'd crawled under the kitchen cabinets right beside it. I moved the fridge and saw that indeed there was Buddy, under the kitchen cabinets. Most definitely, these animals, the jawfish your grandma loved, the Fish, the weasel, and Buddy, are the absolute best *best*. Thinking about it now, I have to say some of my favorite, warmest feelings about my childhood/my parents are tied to Fish. I like that I grew up in a home and had a family that loved the Fish as much as we did. I hope you feel the same way about your grandparents for teaching you about jawfish and other marine life and your family for bringing the weasel to bop around and be a part of your home and childhood. :)</TEXT>
