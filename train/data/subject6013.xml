    <DATE>2013-06-01 05:44:00</DATE>
    <TEXT>It had pictures. I think it was one per chapter. I think the whole book was about an inch thick. Hardcover I believe. There was one story about fairies in a desert? Multiple different stories. I borrowed it from the library when I was around 5 so that would be around 1997. I looked at pictures fromThe Book of Fairies by Michael Hague and I remember it but I don't believe that is the book I'm looking for.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi I run http://alanrickmanportrait.tumblr.com/ and I am looking for someone to help me keep it active. I still think he's an incredible actor but I'm not as into him as I used to be. I don't want to close down the blog because I'd feel like I'm letting down 127 people. But I'd like to keep it active for them too. If you're interested comment or pm me. The one thing I am picky about is making sure that the blog stays just about him no poking shots at other fandoms which is so often tumblr. Just an appreciation of Alan Rickman.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>yes. when i was working for my former boss who could be uncontrollable and a rageaholic at times, I would almost all day pop sugar cubes in my mouth. (Despite that continually lost weight) Usually after his rage episodes. so afterwards I would started to immediately crave it and feel like my mouth was dry. Also I palvolved my horse so that every time I go to take her out of a field or a stall I would snap the chain clip on the lead rope excessively so now when she hears me do it more than once she comes running.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Many but one thats interesting is that I go to a carnival and immediately i know something is off. I see like your stereotypical gyspy wagon/etc and i go iin theres a woman there. My body is a little numb. She has a crystal ball and a mirror she explains to me that I need to save the world and the timeline. And that the ball will show me where I am going and where I need to go and the mirror will transport me there. I look into both but when I look in the mirror she pushes me in. The dream ends there.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>well i mean you have some options the first thing i'm going to do is address some of your complaints. 1. Riding alone. Do you *need* to ride alone? Is your horse rehabbing? Then talk to your trainer about those concerns. 2. Footing. Now this is what I would suggest what I would do. Since you guys are just starting out I would either drag the ring myself,ask to be taught how to and do it, or ask him if i could help him with something so he has time to drag the ring. 3. Jumps. You could inquire with the other people with your trainer about going in together and getting some jumps. Often you can find SUPER cheap jumps that are used. Or maybe buy one or two out of your own pocket. Just be sure to take them if you leave. Okay that being said I would definitely talk to your trainer. Let him know that you support him and want to make things there the best that they possibly can be. And you'd like to talk to him about some functional improvements.</TEXT>

I have never been this pleased with fan merchandise. It is so nice. I think they tend to run tighter. But if you look online there are so old threads from here and other places on the the sizes on there. Which was very helpful to me when buying. Especially since the How To shirt is only in men's sizes.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well you need to get her to some professionals. (IE psychiatrists,therapists) If your wife has depression theres probably a genetic component. Theres probably a chemical imbalance that needs to be adjusted which is not her fault it's just how things are. I would recommend finding a therapist that practices DBT. Continue to support her let you know she can talk to you whenever. That you won't judge her. Honestly it's everything coming together but the first stop is usually medication.</TEXT>

          <TEXT>Same, all my relationships with people have pretty much been like that. I always care more than they do. Now I'm 24 and I just now finally have 3 genuine friends that I can count on. Unfortunately one is a mother and works alot in a different place in her life and the other two live in other states. As far as the "I'm busy" thing I've eventually just taken that as they don't want to hang out. I should be accepting of my lot in life but I'm not. I'm very isolated. I didn't mean to ramble but I wanted you to know you're not alone everyone does this to me too.</TEXT>

          <TEXT>I leave my blinds open and that helps a little. Probably not a good idea but caffeine helps. Sometimes I have some coffee go back to sleep and let it kick in. Also orange juice seems to wake my brain up. The taste of it. I set multiple different alarms. Sometimes I leave the lights on so I periodically wake up and remain in a light sleep if I REALLY need to get up.</TEXT>

          <TEXT>Idk I've been months without it and not felt that much different as far as negative side effects go. People do become dependent on it. At this point I mean I've had 3 espressos and a coffee and gone right to sleep for 9 hours so it doesn't effect me like it would a normal healthy person. But it does help wake my brain up and give me a tiny little boost. Anything that helps right? Also I love the taste of coffee so...</TEXT>

          <TEXT>she just seems like a woman with a face that doesn't always smile all the time. people want to read alot into anything and everything concerning them so i don't take much stock. But maybe it's something more simple like she does still want to be with her husband but didn't want to be a first lady. Maybe she has emotions. Stop making it so people have to live up to your expectations of what they should be.</TEXT>

          <TEXT>you've already made up your mind and refuse to hear anyone else. That is stagnation and arrested development. That is death of growth as a human being. I'm saying your phrasing made no sense. I actually have ideas of how we could solve this problem that people might be happy with but everyone closes their ears just like you. To view the pro-life movement as hate denies the essence of what it is tbh. But you've already made up your mind so why bother commenting? It's just to try and put me down and shut me up. I have good ideas about this but you want to cling to your sense of reality and that's sad but don't come here claiming to be anything but trying to stop people from talking.</TEXT>

          <TEXT>It does because I am pro life and my views do not conform even 60% to what you've said nor do any of my other friends who are pro life. You can sit on your high horse and tell me you know who I am or the many others I know. Or you could ask yourself "what can we do about this?" obvious answer is we're not going away so what can be done? I have some good ideas about where to start but unfortunately you choose to be part of the name calling problem not the solution. I don't call people who abort murderers. No matter how strongly I feel about it. Because I'm not hateful or arrogant. And thats fine to downvote me. I won't stoop to your level while we're having a discussion.</TEXT>

          <TEXT>We could argue about extremists in movements all day but you need to look at the underlying motivators. You've reached a conclusion that will help no one. And certainly not the people you claim to care so much about. Theres nothing wrong with a peacful protest that's what the discussion was about. And I was going to add something to the discussion but because you said you've heard all arguments and ideas you don't want to hear from me. Don't bother commenting then! That's just trying to bully. Say your opinion and leave. Agree to disagree like you said if you don't want to hear others. I was turned off because this becomes a circle jerk and that doesn't solve anything other than validating your own feelings right or wrong. Reddit is supposed to be a place for open discussion. You're not going to get the upper hand here because you're trying to close down discussion and just label people hateful. I could label people too but I don't you don't have moral superiority just because you think you do.</TEXT>

          <TEXT>If that was your point it was very run around way of saying it. And I haven't downvoted you at all. I wasn't trying to bully you into not commenting I was trying to get to something of substance just to be clear of my intentions. I wasn't actually telling you not to comment right now I was saying in the sense of efficiency to be perfectly honest because that's how my mind works. I made a comment about how people are just going to downvote me for having any sort of opinion. And being hateful implies intent. You do not know my intent therefore should not call me hateful.</TEXT>

Violent obsessive behavior in person is quite another. I'm honestly dreading RTX for this reason there are so many psychotic fans who've threatened me.

(Yes downvote treating people with respect every time I come here my point just gets proven further)</TEXT>

          <TEXT>IDK if people are downvoting you cause you spelled Burnie "Bernie" but it seems undeserved. It's weird for me looking back on stuff like I think the first time I ever saw Joel on something was either Felicity or Friends. Both shows that I hated but had decided to watch one episode of. I remember Ashley being on the cover of that magazine I forget the name. During her frag doll days. I remember watching that fake commercial they did for Apple.</TEXT>

          <TEXT>Nope I don't I had never met this person before never talked to them although I knew who they were. They were determined to keep me away from talking to someone or even being seen by them at the VIP party thing. They made person in question very uncomfortable by getting way too close to them. She would block me from trying to talk to them. But mind you only me (everyone else was allowed in to get pictures and talk to them. They shoved me into a wall and body checked and hip checked me more than once. I didn't think they hit me that hard til the next day day I woke up with bruises where they'd laid hands on me. I don't care who downvoted me people need to know these things aren't okay. Neither is the pushing and shoving in lines but that's much different. I was just in too much shock to say anything. Most fans aren't awesome in my experience but people's experiences can be varying even by region. I have met some of the best people through RT though. One of my best friends I met through RT. Downvotes= I just assume you're one of these kinds of people and thus proving my point. Prove me wrong.</TEXT>
