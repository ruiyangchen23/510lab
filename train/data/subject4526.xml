    <TEXT>It's an issue of 'race' and 'bloodline' like it's been hinted many times now. We don't even know what these terms mean in the SnK universe, but they've been used explicitly and there's countless other pieces of evidence that RBA, Zeke, Grisha, Eren, Ymir, Historia, Mikasa, Levi, the nobles, etc., are inherently different from the commoners within the walls. RBA's discourse has been along the lines of 'We don't think of any of you as bad people, but you and us will never be the same anyway, it's just how things are'.</TEXT>

He doesn't seem to know much about humanity besides that. He also doesnt know about the Ackerman clan, which means that either their power is not related to the Titans OR they came from another place in the SnK world that is unknown to him.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>**Abstract** Body weight is regulated by the ability of hypothalamic neurons to orchestrate behavioral, endocrine and autonomic responses via afferent and efferent pathways to the brainstem and the periphery. Weight maintenance requires a balance between energy intake and energy expenditure. Although several components that participate in energy homeostasis have been identified, there is a need to know in more detail their actions as well as their interactions with environmental and psychosocial factors in the development of human obesity. In this review, we examine the role of systemic mediators such as leptin, ghrelin and insulin, which act in the central nervous system by activating or inhibiting neuropeptide Y, Agouti-related peptide protein, melanocortin, transcript related to cocaine and amphetamine, and others. As a result, modifications in energy homeostasis occur through regulation of appetite and energy expenditure. We also examine compensatory changes in the circulating levels of several peripheral hormones after diet-induced weight loss. Arch Endocrinol Metab. 2016;60(2):152-62</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well, I originally wrote that you should eat a diet balanced with the three macro nutrients. There's a few problems with that. First, there's no scientific evidence that a diet made up of, say, 1/3 proteins 1/3 carbohydrates and 1/3 fat is the optimal diet for overall health and longevity. Second, there's no doubt that you need proteins and some fats to survive, but on the other hand the debate on fats vs. carbohydrates (and more specifically sugars) as sources of energy is still ongoing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Those are all really good questions, and I've been thinking about that too. There's obviously no definitive answers, but I will tell you what I've speculated about. First, how did they get there to begin with? Well, in the graphic novels, it states:  #33322; #28023; #12399; #38627; #33322; #12434; #26997; #12417; #12289; #32004; #21322; #25968; #12364; #30446; #30340; #22320; #12395; #21040; #36948; #12377; #12427; #12371; #12392; #12394; #12367; #28040; #24687; #12434; #32118; #12387; #12383; #12290; *The voyage was rough; about half of the ships vanished without reaching the other shore.* Clearly, crossing the ocean was not an easy thing for 'humanity'. So either those with the titan's powers have a much easier method to cross oceans, or, another theory that I've had, is that they were simply 'always' there. It's possible that this so-called new continent was inhabited by RBA's people and the Reiss family for centuries or even thousands of years prior to the start of the story. But even then, it's implied that the First King knew humanity was coming, meaning that they had some kind of contact with people in the old continent. So, either way, intercontinental travel is a thing and it's probably not always as hard as it was for humanity that one time where they left because of the titans. Second, how were the walls were built? Well I doubt it was a simple thing that just happened overnight. If I'm correct and there was a indeed a lot of people there already, then there must have been some kind of established society back then as well. At first the King must have had a lot of supporters, and there might even have been armed conflict between those who supported his ideas and those who didn't. One hint of that is when Kenny mentions that the most powerful of the noble bloodlines (i.e. the Ackerman and the Asians) used to support the Reiss and to serve them until they found out that the King intended to erase the masses' memories. We also know that Zeke talks about 'regaining the Coordinate', implying that it once belonged to his people. Based on all that, I've theorized that it happened somewhat like this: The Reiss, the noble bloodlines (that is, the nobles, the Ackerman and the Asian), and RBA's people are all part of the same larger society. The main human race also lives with them, but they're all just slaves, regarded as inferior and primitive, as a people who will commit atrocities if allowed to live freely. One day, something big happens. Overseas, someone has started turning all the 'slave humans' into Titans and they're getting decimated. It's decided that they should all be brought to the new world to prevent them from all dying. The Reiss want to create a new society where these people will live peacefully. RBA's people disagree. The First King, who has the Coordinate's power, decides to leave them so he can create that new society anyway. The nobles side with him, RBA's people don't. There's a big armed conflict and ultimately the Reiss win. The walls are built, then humanity arrives to the new world. The noble bloodlines find out that the King intends to erase their memories. Most of them don't oppose him except for the Ackerman and the Asians, who rebel against him. I don't know if that makes sense to you? That's how I've imagined it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think that's actually a plausible theory, though for reasons completely different from the ones you bring up here. We know that the warriors talk about 'retrieving' the Coordinate's power, implying that it once belonged to their people. We know also that Grisha most likely came from the same place as the warriors, though it hasn't been explicitly stated yet. It's possible that the First King also came from the same place as the warriors, and that Historia and Eren are distantly related. In turn, that could play a role in Eren being able to use the Coordinate's power and seeing of the memories even though he's not a Reiss.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You're right. It's possible that he never met with Grisha in recent years and simply knew of his existence thanks to R amp;B's inside knowledge. I hadn't thought of that one. But I don't think Grisha had any plans initially when he came to the walls. In Keith Shadis' flashbacks, Grisha first appears outside the walls with memory loss and looking lost as to where he is. To me at least, this implies that, just like Ymir, he was wandering outside the walls as a mindless titan until he ate another shifter by accident. I always thought that was how Grisha ended up near the walls, though I could be wrong.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well, this is purely speculation, but I'll explain why I think that. My theory is that a lot of people from the warriors' society were turned into mindless titans against their will until the few of them that were not found a way to bring back all of them to their human form by developing the shifting power. Three things make me think that: - The warriors keep talking about 'regaining' or 'retaking' the Coordinate power, implying that it once belonged to their people. - In Ymir's [conversation](http://mangafox.me/manga/shingeki_no_kyojin/v12/c047/16.html) with Berthold, she tells him that she didn't remember who she ate in order to regain her human form, to which Berthold replies that it was the same for Reiner and him. Then, he also asks her how much time she had spent wandering around the walls, implying that he has some understanding of the fact that people do not age while transformed into titans and, therefore, that some people have been titans for decades. - In one of the flashback [conversations](http://mangafox.me/manga/shingeki_no_kyojin/v18/c071/18.html) between Keith Shadis and Grisha, Grisha tells him something along the lines of 'at least, you guys aren't living in constant fear of the titans'. I always interpreted this as him referring to his own life before the walls and thinking to himself, 'well, my people wasn't as lucky, we constantly lived with that fear'. Based on that, one of my theories about that the story is that RBA's people used to live peacefully because they could protect themselves from the titans thanks to the Coordinate's power, which allows the user to control those of the supposedly 'evil' human race who had been turned into mindless titans in order to be used as weapons against them. But when the First King (who had that power at the time) left their society, it screwed them over because they couldn't protect themselves from the titans anymore. People from their society started being slaughtered by the mindless titans. So, in order to not completely die out, they developed the shifting power and became a warfare-centered society. And that's also why they're trying to retrieve the Coordinate's power and to wipe out the humans within the walls. On one hand, regaining the power would allow them to better defend themselves from the already existing titans, and on the other, wiping out humanity as a whole would ensure that no more mindless titans can ever be made against them again. So, simply put, I think Grisha was one of the people from the warriors' society who became a mindless titan. And then, one day, like Ymir, he regained control of his human form by eating another shifter and ended up near the walls.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Agreed. Also, Reiner's had so many unbelievably close calls at this point that I'm convinced Isayama doesn't want to kill him and has some long-term plan for the character instead. I've come up with a few ideas for why Reiner might stick around: - Reiner is now a valuable asset to the warriors, since he's now the only one of them with inside knowledge about their enemy, assuming that Berthold dies in the next chapter of course. From a lore perspective, it makes sense for him to not be killed by his own people, even if they have a habit of punishing failure with death like it's been implied. - One of the most recurring themes in the story is moral ambiguity, and Reiner best represents that, both through his actions and personality. From a literary perspective, it makes sense for him to stick around as well. - Compared to Berthold, Reiner and Annie have been presented as much more redeemable both to the reader and to the main protagonists of the story. It's possible that they will fight again with the Survey Corps and eventually be killed for good, but it's also possible that Isayama has planned to give them some kind of 'redemption' storyline instead.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, this pannel is basically Isayama's version of 'making it obvious' to the reader. At this point, the only questions left to ask relate to how closely related they were. Is Zeke actually Eren's uncle like some people on the sub have suspected? Isayama said that Eren and Armin might not always be friends. Is it possible that once Eren finds out the truth about the history of the world and learns from Zeke that he has family living outside the walls, he will side with the warriors? Doubt that will happen, but that would be a pretty crazy turning point in the story.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've read on the [SnK wiki](http://attackontitan.wikia.com/wiki/Thread:34078) that, according to some native speakers of Japanese, the Japanese word for 'brainwashing' used by Zeke is the same word that's also used to refer to how TV ads can 'brainwash' people in Japan. In other words, he didn't mean that Eren was literally mentally manipulated, but rather, that he was told a bunch of lies and brought to believe certain things that aren't true by his father. But I haven't been able to find a source for that yet, and I'm not a native speaker of Japanese myself, so take that piece of information with a grain of salt. Also, did you notice how all of the Ackerman members who have 'awakened' their bloodline's power seem to serve as someone's bodyguard in some way? Kenny's grandfather [mentioned](http://mangafox.me/manga/shingeki_no_kyojin/v16/c065/5.html) that the Ackerman used to serve as the king's right hands before the whole memory wipe drama. Also, in the present time, all the awakened Ackerman members more or less serve as someone's 'bodyguard': Kenny served King Uri until the latter's death, Levi pretty much only listens to what Erwin says and seems to care for his safety more than anything else, and Mikasa follows Eren everywhere he goes and wants to protect him at all cost. I don't know about you, but to me that's not a coincidence. There seems to be something about the Ackerman bloodline's power that makes its users want to serve and protect a certain person almost obsessively. Something else that I don't think is a coincidence either is how the awakened Ackerman members resemble the Norse berserkers. As we know, a lot of things in the SnK universe are based on the pre-Christan Germanic conception of the universe. In Norse mythology, the berserkers are shamanistic warriors who serve as the bodyguards of Odin, the king of the main bloodline of gods. What makes them so powerful is that, when they go into battle, they enter some kind of trance-like state that grants them superhuman physical abilities, which is where the expression 'going berserk' actually comes from. They were referred to as 'monsters' and greatly feared throughout the Germanic world. Similarly, the Ackerman used to serve as the king's bodyguards and still fulfill the same societal role in the present time. When they first unlock their power, based on what we've seen, they get in a situation where they have to fight for survival and then they suddenly awaken superhuman physical abilities as a result of that. Also, Kenny's grandfather [mentioned](http://mangafox.me/manga/shingeki_no_kyojin/v16/c065/4.html) that the Ackerman were feared by the Reiss family. See all the similarities here? Like I said, that can't be a coincidence either. There's definitely something special and unique about the Ackerman bloodline. They are not the same as the majority race (that's already been confirmed by Kenny's grandfather), and they are certainly not 'regular' humans by any definition. So I don't know if Grisha gave her any memories or brainwashed her like he did with Eren by using the titan's power, but it's possible that he understood what kind of power was dwelling within her, and that he thought she would be able to protect Eren and to help him fulfill his mission once he was gone. That would explain why he wanted Eren to be friends with her and why he immediately took her in when her parents died. A lot of what we've been shown in the story so far about the Ackerman and the Asian bloodlines suggests that they were the two most powerful ones within the walls, but that they were kept in check because they were loyal to the king and because of the Coordinate power. Unlike them, the other noble bloodlines haven't been shown or hinted to have any particular ability except for their immunity to the Coordinate's memory-wiping power. But there's so many unanswered questions still. Just how powerful can the Ackerman be? And how do they compare to the most powerful titan shifters (which we've probably not seen yet) in terms of fighting power? With the element of surprise of his side, Levi easily took down a Warchief of the warriors' society. Based on that, I don't think it's too far-fetched to say that the Ackerman have the potential to be just as strong if not stronger than the titan shifters. Also, we don't even know anything about the Asian bloodline, but it's hinted that they also had 'something special' about them that goes beyond mere differences in physical appearance and which could also be some kind of power. Based on that, it's possible that Mikasa, as a member of both bloodlines, has the potential to be the most powerful individual within the walls. We don't know how much Grisha knew, but if he had figured out all of that, then it's easy to see why he had taken a special interest in Mikasa even long before her parents' death.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Something to keep in mind is that the Ackerman used to serve the First King *until* the whole memory wipe drama. When that happened, they rebelled against him. On the contrary, it was the other houses, the 'regular' nobles, who continued to obey him. Obviously we don't know what actually happened back then, but I doubt it's so simple as them being magically forced to serve someone.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Unless something major and unexpected happens, this entire volume will probably be about the direct aftermath of the battle, that is, the period of time between the end of the battle and the time when they're back at the Survey Corps' HQ and resting and mourning their dead. Based on that, here are my expectations for what will likely NOT happen in this upcoming chapter: - We most likely won't see the content of Ymir's letter - We most likely won't see what's in the basement - We most likely won't see Eren tell the others what Zeke told him about his father - We most likely won't see more Zeke/Reiner/Quadrupedal titan moments On the other hand, the cliffhanger with Mikasa will probably get resolved right away at the start of next chapter, because it's the most immediate problem that has to be solved in the story and solving it would tie the start of this chapter with the end of the last one. Also, I definitely think that we'll see Berthold and either Erwin or Armin die, and that we'll see either Erwin or Armin get the serum injected into their body, become a titan, and then eat Berthold and become a titan shifter. We might even see all of that in this upcoming chapter. It's been implied that both Erwin and Armin have only a couple of minutes left to live given their current condition, so unless the chapter represents a time frame of less than 5-10 min, I think it's likely that this is all going down in this chapter. Some alternate scenarios that I've come up with but that I don't think are very likely to happen: - Berthold has some kind of last resort ability up his sleeve and miraculously escapes, thus leaving both Erwin and Armin to die. - Either Erwin or Armin gets the serum injected, becomes a titan and then eats Berthold, but then nothing happens because they're part of the inferior human race that was enslaved by the First King and thus they can't get the shifting power. - The chapter is about flashbacks of Reiner and Berthold when they were younger in their 'hometown', and then we see Reiner reacts to realizing that Berthold is probably dead in the present time, and then the chapter ends with Berthold actually getting eaten and dying. However, who eats him is not shown, it's the cliffhanger and we find out next chapter.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's the same thing for Ymir. If she's based on Ymir from Norse mythology then she already did die. Also, in the chapter named after her she does mention that she 'died for the happiness of a great people'. We don't know what that really means of course, but following your logic then Ymir will probably not die either, because she already did so in a way.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've envisioned the following scenario: The chapter starts with a flashbacks of Reiner and Berthold when they were younger in their 'hometown'. Then we get back to the present time where we see Reiner react to realizing that Berthold is probably dead. Then we see Berthold get eaten by a titan, but we're not shown who that titan is. It's the cliffhanger and we find out next chapter. Not saying that's what will happen, but it's a plausible alternative to the chapter starting with an Ackerman showdown, don't you think?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've said this before, but I don't think Isayama plans to kill Reiner and Annie. Berthold is done for, like you said, because he explicitly stated that he wanted to kill them all and then he actively tried to kill Armin. Thus, from the main protagonists' perspective, he's 'too far gone', there's no coming back for him. By comparison, Reiner and Annie have been presented as much more redeemable from the perspectives of both the reader and the main protagonists of the story. Also, it's obvious that we will see Annie again, but I believe that Reiner also has some future role to play in the story, since he's now the only warrior from the 'Hometown' with inside knowledge about the society inside the walls (assuming that Berthold will die), and, more importantly, he also represents moral ambiguity, which is one of the most recurring and most emphasized themes throughout the story.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; Also, didn't Ymir once refer to Historia as a "goddess" when she was talking about dying in the cold? Then Ymir made reference to herself being a "goddess" the last time we saw her? Could that be some sort of foreshadowing that Ymir has in fact died? No, I don't think that's exactly it. I believe [this](http://mangafox.me/manga/shingeki_no_kyojin/v10/c040/23.html) is the page you're referring to. Ymir had hypothesized that Historia wanted to die so she could be remembered as someone who was willing to put her life at risk for other people, or in Ymir's words, as a 'goddess'. When Ymir talks about 'playing goddess' in chapter 50.1, I interpret it as her saying that she's willing to put her own life at risk for R amp;B in the same way that Historia wanted to 'play goddess' by putting herself at risk for someone else just so she could die and be remembered as a good person. In other words, Ymir went with R amp;B to help them but also knowing that she might die, that their people might get another one of their warriors to take back the power she took from them by eating her. However, it doesn't necessarily mean that she did actually die. It just means, like I said, that she went into this knowing very well that she might indeed be killed. In all cases, we don't know whether they ended up going home with her or not. The [timeline of the story](http://attackontitan.wikia.com/wiki/Timeline) on the wiki states that at least two months passed between the last time we see Ymir and the first time we see R amp;B and Zeke again after that, so it's possible that they did but regardless there's just no way to tell what really happened to Ymir for now.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well, I like Ymir's character and I would like to see her stay alive until the end, but I also try to see the positive side of things. Isayama basically said in an interview that she holds the key to the entire story, so regardless of whether she's alive or dead, there is no doubt that we will see her again in one way or another before the end. Also, if she is indeed dead, it could turn out to be a huge character development for Historia when she finds out about it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Random thoughts in this evening: Reiner said that Berthold was the strongest, but I always thought that Reiner was. People say that he's lucky, but so far he's mainly survived because he was able to use an ability of the titan's power that is said to be extremely hard to use correctly. Of all three of them, I always thought Reiner was the most warrior-like in his personality and actions, even though he's also done some controversial stuff and had some major fuck-ups. He's looked kinda bad lately due to his titan being bad at straight up one-vs-one combat, but I'm pretty convinced that Reiner is actually an exceptional foe in many ways. Something to keep in mind is that Reiner graduated at the top of the 104th Training Corps, only second to Mikasa, who isn't exactly a 'regular' human either.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This has been one of my theories as well. The only characters we've seen so far who have either turned into titan shifters or been implied to be able to do so are those who are separate from the majority race inside the walls. We haven't seen anyone from the regular humans (who were enslaved by the First King) become a titan shifter yet. It's possible that these people simply can't become shifters because they don't belong to one of those 'superior' bloodlines. This upcoming chapter will probably give us some interesting information about the titans.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I agree with everything you said and I think you bring up some really interesting points. First, I'd never thought of that myself, but now that I think of it, you're right in asking why it is that people in the story always seem to become shifters when they're just children. It's a very significant question. Eren was turned into a titan by his father when he was just a kid; in the Reiss family, people receive the Coordinate power at a young age; and RBAM and Ymir also became titan shifters when they were just children. Age might even explain why Grisha gave the power to his son instead of using it himself. I like to think that his death wasn't just an accident, and that he let himself be eaten by Eren because he knew that he couldn't use the power himself; and now that you bring it up, it could very well have to do with him being simply too old to use it. Also, if the Coordinate power is as valuable to the 'Hometown' society as it's been implied, then why would they send some inexperienced and newly turned warriors to retrieve it? Warrior societies were a big thing in pre-Christian Germanic societies, but ironically, the dictionary defines a warrior as 'a person engaged or experienced in warfare', and as stated by themselves RBA had no experience when they first came to the wall. In fact, Reiner put it best himself when he said that they 'were just brats who knew nothing back then'. And to be honest, Reiner is the only one of them who ever came off as somewhat of a  #8216;warrior #8217; to me. He is strong-willed, has a sense of leadership, can work with others well and remained devoted to the cause he served even when he had lost all notion of right and wrong. On the other hand, Annie was always the loner type and she clearly looked she didn #8217;t want to be here killing people and was only doing all of this for her father; and Berthold never showed any decisiveness and only ever followed what Reiner said, and he only started being more confident when he became angry upon remembering all the suffering that people from both sides had endured because of the conflict that he was involved in. Based on that, the  #8216;Hometown #8217; sent RBAM to get the job done either because they are idiots or because they were forced due to their own circumstances, and for the sake of making the story interesting I hope that it #8217;s the latter. Second, regarding the serums, I don #8217;t know if the shifters were aware of their existence, but now they should definitely be, since Reiner heard the conversation between Hange, Jean and Mikasa about them. Regarding the Reiss family, I think there #8217;s a lot of evidence which suggests that the Coordinate power didn #8217;t come from their family originally. Rod Reiss said that only the Reiss bloodline can use the power to its fullest extent, so based on that I #8217;ve theorized that the  #8216;First King #8217; was born into the same society as RBAM and then one day left them to make his own society, which became the world within the walls that we know of in the current story. But if that #8217;s true that only a Reiss can use it, then why would RBAM and Zeke go to such lengths to retrieve it? Either the  #8216;Hometown #8217; people are a bunch of ignorant idiots, or Rod Reiss simply isn #8217;t telling the truth. Alternatively, it #8217;s possible that other Reiss descendants who can also use the power live outside the walls, but that seems a little far-fetched. Also, if that #8217;s the case, then why did Grisha tell Eren that he would figure out how to use that power with the help of the memories of those who had the power before him once he went to the basement? Again, someone here has to be wrong. In all cases, I agree that the Reiss most likely didn #8217;t make those serums themselves, and in particular, the  #8216;Braun  #8211; Armor #8217; bottle that Rod had in the Reiss compound under the church heavily suggests that they took all that technology from the  #8216;Hometown #8217; society a long time ago. I don #8217;t know how the First King was connected to that society, but there #8217;s definitely some kind of connection between them, which would also explain why they also want to  #8216;save #8217; Historia in the same way that they want to  #8216;save #8217; Eren like I #8217;ve said in the OP. edit: I realize that this isn't that well-written. I'm sorry about that. I was trying to convey all my thoughts really quickly here due to lacking time. Hopefully we can continue this discussion later.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Something that we've seen the shifters consistently do up until now is underestimate their enemies. Considering that R amp;B lived with the top soldiers of the Survey Corps for many years, they should have been able to accurately compare their strength with their own. And yet, they weren't able to do so, which really highlights their lack of experience as warriors. Another reason why they underestimated them is probably that they see them as an inferior race of ignorant individuals, like they #8217;ve stated themselves. But I doubt they will that mistake again considering the crushing defeat they just had, so because of that the next time they meet things will definitely be different. Regarding humanity, I don't think it's necessarily 'them vs. everyone else' (though they do seem to be hated by a lot of the other races for reasons that have yet to be revealed), but I do think it's a case of them being the only ones who are ignorant and that everyone else outside the walls has at least some understanding of the world's history and of the nature and origins of the titan's power. Also, there are definitely different factions. Ymir did not come from the same place as them, and if Annie is part of their group it's only very recent; there #8217;s evidence of that in the RBA flashback scene in chapter 77 ('The World They Saw'), in which Reiner tells her that she needs to take off Marco's equipment in order to prove that 'her father and her are different from the defiled race' within the walls or something like that. This suggests that her family joined their society more recently and that they used to be with the people who currently live within the walls before they did. Concerning people outside the walls in general, one major hint that they know  #8216;what's going on #8217; is what we know about Ymir's past. If she was a mindless titan for 60 years, then she became a titan at most 70 years before the start of the story. In chapter 18.5 (Side Story: Ilse's Notebook), it's hinted that the members of her people were also all turned into titans as well. Now we know that Ymir, while she doesn't have as much knowledge as the 'Hometown' about the titan's power, definitely knows more than those who live inside the walls. We also know that all knowledge about the world's history and the titan's power inside the walls was taken away by the First King's power over a century prior to the start of the story. Therefore, if Ymir's people had some understanding of these things and was also around about 70 years ago, then by inference people outside the walls never had their memories erased and must have been aware of what was happening in the world at the time. In fact, it #8217;s even possible that all that is currently  #8216;titan territory #8217; outside the walls used to be land inhabited by different human races and that Ymir #8217;s people used to live somewhere on that land. Another obstacle to the  #8216;people within the walls vs. everyone else #8217; theory is the Ackerman and Asian clans. Their powers appear to be different from those of the  #8216;Hometown #8217; warriors, and it #8217;s possible that they #8217;re not even related to the titan #8217;s power at all. More importantly, the  #8216;Hometown #8217; warriors don #8217;t seem to know about these powers. Zeke seems to have intimate knowledge of the walled society #8217;s history, since he knows that the First King used his titan #8217;s power to erase people #8217;s memories and he even knows the name  #8216;Reiss #8217; himself, as we see in chapter 81 ( #8216;Promise #8217;). By comparison, he was completely caught off guard by Levi #8217;s physical abilities and did not seem to understand what made him so strong. I don #8217;t know how these two bloodlines specifically are related to the First King or if they came from the same society as him, but based on everything I #8217;ve just mentioned, it #8217;s possible that they originally came from a different place altogether in the SnK universe. Furthermore, they are different from the other noble bloodlines, because they have some kind of unique power, whereas these bloodlines are not shown to be special in any way beyond the fact that they #8217;re from a race that can #8217;t be mentally manipulated by the Coordinate power. In short, yeah there are definitely different factions in the SnK universe and it #8217;s possible that they are merely divided by  #8216;bloodlines #8217; or  #8216;races #8217; as well as historical unions between certain of the smaller and more powerful of these bloodlines. Based on what we know so far, it #8217;s very speculative but this is how I would divide the different groups in the story: - The majority bloodline of humans that was enslaved by the First King - The Ackerman bloodline - The Asian bloodline - The other noble bloodlines within the walls - The  #8216;Hometown #8217; society + the Reiss family (which originally came from the  #8216;Hometown #8217; over a century prior to the start of the story) - Ymir #8217;s people On a side note, this is off-topic, but I #8217;ve been wondering for two years now if the story isn #8217;t actually a narration of the past history of humanity by either Eren or Historia. There #8217;s a few things that make me suspect that. First, you could argue that all of the events in the story so far have happened either from the perspective of Eren, from that of Historia, or from both of their perspectives at the same time. Second, and this is what started this crazy theory for me, at the end of chapter 50 ( #8216;Cry #8217;), when the narrating voice says  #8216;At the time, we didn #8217;t understand the meaning of the course of action that Ymir undertook, but... the Armored Titan didn #8217;t pursue us any further #8217;, it really sounds like either Eren or Historia is telling a story of the past from the present. Third, the name  #8216;Historia #8217; itself implies story-telling, since  #8216;Historia #8217; is a Latin word that is a transliteration of the Greek word  #8216; #7985; #963; #964; #959; #961; #943; #945; #8217;, for  #8216;knowledge from inquiry #8217; or  #8216;judge #8217;, and can mean either  #8216;written account of past events #8217; or  #8216;writing of history #8217;. Maybe this is a little too far-fetched to be true, but I would love to hear what you think about this particular theory!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Good question. We have evidence that injecting the serum is not the only method to become a titan. But we don't know how the 'serum method' differs from the method Zeke used, since we have no clue what method he actually uses to begin with. However, what I suspect is that the substance in those serums is the same substance that is also used to make the actual titan body. We do not know what the 'serum substance' used to make the titans is, but we do know a lot of its chemical properties. First, as Hange [states](http://mangafox.me/manga/shingeki_no_kyojin/v17/c070/24.html), the 'serum substance' evaporates very easily. She mentions that, when in its liquid state, it 'vaporizes instantly when exposed to air'. More To be more specific, what she likely means is that the substance evaporates in a matter of macro or even nanoseconds due to its molecules having a high tendency to escape their liquid form at any given temperature. Second, have you noticed how the transformation into a titan also takes place in a matter of less than one second? We can tell that the substance undergoes this phase change extremely quickly, because the transformation itself releases a large amount of heat. Furthermore, this is also evidence that it undergoes this phase change with the help of some other substance found in the human body. This is because the first step of solidification is a process by which the molecules start to form 'clusters', and these clusters form more quickly when they are aided by foreign particles that they use as a 'temporary support' to form on. In other words, the liquid substance possibly becomes the actual titan body with the help of some solid substance inside the human body. Finally, the biggest evidence that we have of the substance used to make the titan body being the same as the 'serum' substance is what happens when titan shifters go back to their human form. Before Eren had the hardening ability, do you remember how its solid titan body would instantly become a gaseous substance when he would get out of it? This is a sign of a highly volatile substance, that is, a substance that evaporates very easily in a closed system, because sublimation is only possible when a substance has such a high vapor pressure that it vaporizes before its melting point is even reached. So, in short, there is some chemical evidence that the 'serum' substance could be either the same as the substance used to form the actual titan body or closely related to it, because both appear to be highly chemically efficient and to undergo phase changes extremely quickly. Based on that, I would say that Zeke simply has another method to inject that substance directly into the human body. As to what that method could be, I don't want to speculate too much just yet, because I'm not sure to what extent the laws of physics of our world apply in the SnK universe. On a side note, one noticeable difference between the 'titan shifters' and the 'mindless titans' is that the former's titan body appears to both form and function thanks to a source of energy found inside the human body itself, whereas the later appear to form with the same source of energy but to function thanks to electromagnetic radiation from the sun afterwards, since the individual's human body is almost entirely 'eaten up' by the transformation process. What bugs me, however, is the fact that they're mentioned to also use the moon as a source of energy... In the real world the moon does emit thermal radiation, but it's so insignificant that it's often just not taken into account, so there definitely has to be another source of energy that powers 'mindless titans' at night.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've said this before, but I think Reiner will stick around for a couple reasons: - Assuming that Berthold will die, Reiner is now the only warrior with inside knowledge about their enemies, so his superiors have a reason to keep him alive despite his failure. - From a literary perspective, it makes sense for him to stick around because he represents one of the most recurring themes throughout the story, which is moral ambiguity. - Compared to Berthold, Annie and him have been presented as much more redeemable to both the reader and the main protagonists of the story; it's possible that Isayama has some kind of 'redemption' storyline in store for them. Also, I personally think that Reiner is the most 'warrior-like' of all the warriors from outside the walls. They were all inexperienced and they all had some major fuck ups, no doubt about that. But Reiner is strong-willed, he has a sense of leadership, he can work in a team very well, and most importantly, even when his convictions were deeply shaken and his notion of right and wrong was being thrown out the window, he still remained devoted to being a warrior and to fulfilling his mission until the bitter end no matter what. By comparison, Annie was always sort of a laner, and she never really looked like she wanted to be in those walls going around and killing people. It seems to me as though she was just doing all of this for her father. And Berthold never had any decisiveness, he just followed Reiner around and waited for him to make something happen. He only became decisive after becoming angry from the realization that so many people had suffered because of the conflict he was involved in.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've come to a conclusion very similar to yours. Grisha is heavily implied to be a relative of Zeke. We don't know how or why he ended up near the walls. But what appears clear is that, once he started living alongside the members of the majority race within the walls, he came to the conclusion that they weren't this 'defiled race of ignorant and stubborn fools' like most of their society seems to believe. After all, RBA underwent the same shift in thinking, because in the end Reiner stated that they didn't want to wipe out humanity anymore and that they simply wanted to leave with Eren instead; it was only when Zeke ordered them to  #8216;put an end to the cursed history #8217; in the latest arc that they resumed their attempts to kill everyone. Just like Zeke, Grisha was probably aware that humanity was being kept in ignorance by the Coordinate power. He probably also knew that his people would eventually come to retrieve it, and that they would also wipe everyone out in the process, which he didn't want to happen. Perhaps he had initially hoped that the royalty would finally show up and defend humanity once his people started destroying the walls. However, he eventually realized that this was obviously not going to happen, so he went to the Reiss church with the intention of taking the power from them and then giving it to his son so he would the be one to use it to protect humanity instead. As to why he couldn #8217;t use that power himself, we don #8217;t know. But clearly he didn #8217;t think that the Reiss family would use it either, so he murdered all of Historia #8217;s other siblings as well. Also, Rod Reiss told Eren and Historia that only someone from the Reiss bloodline could use the power effectively, but he #8217;s most likely wrong, since both Grisha and the rest of the  #8216;Hometown #8217; society appear to be certain that it can in fact be used by someone who's not from the Reiss bloodline. There's also the possibility that both Eren and some people who live in the 'Hometown' society today are also from that same bloodline, but I think that's much less likely given what we currently know. Concerning your theory, you say that Grisha had befriended the Reiss family in order to more easily steal the power from them. But I don't think that's true, since Rod Reiss also told Eren and Historia that he didn't know who Grisha was prior to meeting him in the titan compound on the day that he murdered his family. Also, I don't think Grisha is directly related to the Reiss family, but I do think it's possible that the 'First Reiss King' came from the 'Hometown' society as well. Zeke and RBA have talked about 'retrieving' and 'taking back' the Coordinate power, implying that their people once had that power. Based on that, it's possible that the First Reiss King was someone who came from their society and who eventually left them in order to create his own society which would later become the world within the walls that we know in the current story. Another evidence of that is the fact that Reiner has talked about 'saving' Historia in the same way that Zeke has talked about 'saving' Eren in the last chapter. This implies that Reiner also sees Historia as someone who belongs with his people and who shouldn't live in the 'cursed world' within the walls.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Reiner, the only actually warrior-like member of the Hometown warriors! I for one don't mind seeing him stick around. He's become one of the most important members of the Hometown society because of his inside knowledge about their enemies. He also represents moral ambiguity, one of the most recurring themes in the story. As of last chapter, he might have even become one of the most important characters in the entire story along with Eren, Mikasa, Levi, Historia, etc.; since he has miraculously survived the last decisive battle, he's now one of the only living people to have a LOT of intimate knowledge about more than one faction in the story. Berthold will most likely die, but I think it's possible that Isayama has some kind of 'redemption storyline' in store for Reiner and Annie...</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yep, agreed there too. There's definitely a good deal of evidence that the Reiss came from the same place as RBA a long time ago and that he somehow took the power. But I think that the basement simply contains instructions on how to use the Coordinate power, since in one of Eren's flashbacks Grisha tells him that when he goes there 'their memories' would help him understand how to use the power.</TEXT>

What if Isayama has decided to suddenly accelerate the pace of the story, or to suddenly reveal a lot of new information, and it turns out that in the same chapter we are shown both who eats Berthold AND the content of Ymir's letter? I know it seems crazy, but at this point everyone expects this chapter to give out very little information as usual, so Isayama could surprise his readers by doing the exact opposite, that is, by throwing out a bunch of big reveals all at once.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Exactly. But finding out Ymir's current status is basically getting a big reveal at this point. Her fate has been kept a mystery for so long. The last time we saw her was over 30 chapters ago and since then, almost no info at all. I'm pretty sure a letter in which she simply tells Historia whether she's going to live or die would make a good portion of the manga community lose their minds.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ok I've changed my mind about this chapter now. Everyone expects very little exciting stuff to come out of it as usual, but personally I expect some pretty big reveals. Something to keep in mind is that Isayama [stated](http://shingekikyojin.net/archives/44324850.html) that he wanted the story to end by late 2018 at the latest, which means that there's less than thirty chapters left. With all the mysteries about the SnK universe that still have to be explained, Isayama doesn't have the time to spend three chapters on who between Erwin and Armin gets to live. Also, I don't know if we've reached the actual climax of the story, but we've sure reached a climactic point: it's the end of the Survey Corps' biggest battle to date, they've gotten an opportunity to get another titan's power for the time, and with the outermost wall having been sealed up and their enemies having been chased out of the walls for at least a good while, their only next logical step is going to the basement. With all this in mind, the answers just HAVE to start coming out. People are pessimistic but I choose to believe that this is it, that this chapter is actually where the big reveals start happening. In all cases, we'll find out in a couple days, but I think that it's very likely we'll get at least one piece of information of significant importance about the story in this chapter.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I just realized something. The scariest thing about the recent events isn't that the SC barely made it against Reiner and Berthold. Rather, it's what Ymir said about these guys being 'such small fry'. This implies that there are titan shifters out there who are exponentially stronger than them. I means, it makes sense, Reiner said himself that they had no experience prior to coming to the walls. Their leaders probably thought that it would be an easy mission for inexperienced warriors like them, all they had to in theory do was to kill a bunch of defenseless humans and then subdue one titan shifter. But if RBA are 'small fry', then I can't imagine the kind of power that their experienced warriors have. If humanity wants to even stand a chance against such power, Eren needs to go to the basement ASAP.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>[Manga Spoilers ](#s " I think one simple reason why Eren and Historia get along well is that their lives are completely opposite and yet very similar at the same time. Completely opposite, as Eren was born a regular person but was forced into a 'special' life, whereas Historia was born a 'special' person but was forced into a regular life. Very similar, as both have had the titan's power forced into their lives and it has been both a curse and a blessing at the same time. Also, as it's been hinted in chapter 47, Eren and Historia, along with Reiner, Berthold and Ymir, are part of the 'children' who have been forced to live in the world of the titans because of the circumstances in which they were born (hence the name of the chapter, 'Children').")</TEXT>

Even RBA, who are supposed to be 'the bad guys', are implied to be fighting for a great cause that they believe to be worth giving their lives for. The only question is: whose cause do you believe is most worth fighting for? If Eren ever turns his back on humanity it should be because he thinks that the shifters are right and that humanity isn't worth saving, not because a few of his comrades didn't choose his friend's life.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So now that I've had the chance to look at all the panels multiple times, here's a few thoughts: - The future clashes between Eren and Armin that Isayama hinted at a while back could be because Armin has the titan's power too now. He may have a very different idea of how to use that power effectively, and now that he's actually powerful physically, he might be more inclined to impose his ideas and vision on others. - There's no evidence that Armin's titan will be anything like Berthold's. We don't know how 'titan powers' are passed from person to another. One thing to keep in mind is that all the titan shifters from the 'Hometown' are very physiologically similar to their titan as humans: Berthold was taller than others and sweated a lot, Reiner is solid like a rock, and Annie is short but relatively strong and fast. This is a big hint that the titan's powers are based on the human's body. In all cases, we don't know how Armin will be, it's not reasonable to simply say that he'll be Colossal Titan 2.0. - We don't know what the SC is going to do next, that is, whether they will go straight to the basement or whether they will go back home first to rest and mourn their dead. But if they go back home, the implications of the Commander being dead could be pretty big. We haven't seen the chapter in its entirety yet. It's possible that the chapter ends with the reader finding out that the nobles are going to rebel against the SC because of Erwin's death, to try and take back control of the city from them. Also, if they go back home right away, we'll probably see the content of Ymir's letter sooner than expected. - After this crushing defeat, the shifters will never underestimate humanity again. The next time they show up, they will probably strike with their full force upon humanity, and it could very well be the final battle of the story.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Agreed. Also, those 'future differences' between Eren and Armin that Isayama hinted at a while back sure do make a lot of sense now. Armin is very smart, but he could never impose his ideas and vision upon others because he lacked the actual power to do so. Now that he a titan's power, he has the whole world within his grasp. In other words, it's possible that titan Armin is gonna f-ck sh-t up!!</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; How will this affect the plot dynamics from this point? My guess would be, it won't affect them that much. Yes Armin is smart and having him as a titan could be a huge improvement for the SC. But remember, Ymir said that RBA were 'small fries'. They are inexperienced warriors, in Reiner's own words. Probably explains why Zeke didn't seem to make a big deal out of Berthold's death. It's implied that their veteran warriors are far more powerful. That's why Eren needs to go to the basement ASAP. Now the shifters are pissed and they might send veteran warriors to handle the problem.</TEXT>

I'm not in disagreement with any of the events that take place in this chapter, but even if I was, I'm not going to drop a story that I've been enjoying for the past seven years just because I disagree with one decision the author made. Also, my guess would be that a lot of people are saying that out of anger or disappointment from seeing one of their favorite characters die.

    <TEXT>Overall, after looking back at this chapter, I'm pretty happy by how it turned out. Some people were selfish and violent, some people died, and we get a good setup for learning more about the titan's power in the next months. I really wanted more information about the story's universe and the titans, but that's probably for next chapter. At least we got to see the story progress in a meaningful way. edit: and I will probably write a detailed analysis later, but I think it's best to wait for the whole thing to be released first.

    <TEXT>But that's not how things really are, don't you think? In our world, many people die even though they could have survived in slightly different circumstances. Many people also die cruelly, unfairly and without a chance to ever achieve their dreams. Erwin never got to see the basement. Berthold never got to tell Annie how he felt. And for all we know, RBA's society could have been screwed over by humanity a long time ago and could now be trying to retrieve the Coordinate power so they can save their own people from another even bigger threat. The point is, it's not ever 'fair' in life. Also, all of the characters are selfish and ultimately only care about their loved ones and their own goals and interests.</TEXT>

Personally I never get really attached to the characters in the stories I read, so it doesn't mean that much to me whether some of them live or die. Initially, I wasn't too sure what /u/YonkouProductions meant when he said that people were 'losing their shit' over this chapter, but after browsing through Tumblr and 4chan, I can see what he meant. It seems that people are genuinely upset over this, and I'm not too sure why. If you've been analyzing every chapter every month then this was more than predictable. Isayama has been building Armin's character into an Erwin replacement for a while now.</TEXT>

He was plagued with guilt and remorse like all of them and he's definitely been shown to be 'human' too, but in the end, for multiple reasons, he decided that wiping out humanity was still the best decision. And that was basically Berthold in a nutshell. On the other hand, I think Reiner's character is much more interesting. He is the embodiment of moral ambiguity. First, all three of them had some major fuck-ups, but Reiner made all the tough decisions when it was time for them to move on with their mission. And even though he was probably the most guilt-ridden of them, he never really showed it to his enemies. There was this one time with Eren and Ymir where he had his split personality problem, but that's about it. In my view, he is the most 'warrior-like' of them, the most suited for the kind of lifestyle that his people are forced to live. But at the same time, Reiner's actions have been controversial most of the time. By the time he revealed who he was, he clearly didn't fully think that what he was doing was right anymore, he even said it in chapter 40, 'I don't know what's right and wrong anymore...'. He openly stated that he didn't want to kill anyone anymore, he only resumed his attempts to do it when his warchief showed up and he had no other choice than to follow his order to kill everyone. Also, how contradictory is it that he shows up into the walls to kill everyone, but also wants to give Krista a letter? I understand that she's not from the same defiled race as the others and that he wants to 'save' her for Ymir's sake, but still, there's something ironic about his behavior in this specific case. So, in short, Reiner's much more interesting because he's morally ambiguous and his behavior is extremely erratic. He's still devoted to being a warrior, but I think that deep inside he doesn't see any of his own actions as right anymore and it'll be interesting to see how he turns out.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't think Mikasa was trying to resist anymore at this point though. We can't tell for sure without the text but from her facial expression it looks like by the time Hange is holding her she's more desperate than angry. It's as if she could see that Levi and Hange had a point about Erwin, but at the time she didn't want to see Armin go, so she wasn't fighting anymore, just moaning in despair, unable to fathom the idea that he would actually die.</TEXT>

Also, it's like you said, Hange and Levi probably feel sad too, because Erwin wasn't just their Commander he was also their friend. But unlike the other members of the SC they can't show their emotions, since as the authority figures of the organization they're supposed to show strength of character. They can't be crying all over the place about his death.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I keep referring back to that, but the biggest hint for me that Armin is going to have a big shift in thinking is that interview from a couple years back in which Isayama said that Eren and Armin would not always be friends. So far they were still friends, but I think it could change now that Armin is a titan, even though I can't tell you why. It's just an impression. Armin is a guy who thinks a lot, so I feel like something as significant as almost dying and then becoming a titan is going to make him drastically rethink his life as a whole.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Some thoughts on what you said: 1) I agree that what Eren said was pretty shitty. It felt to me like Eren and Mikasa were so desperate to see Armin live that they tried to pull out whatever they could come up with at the time to convince Levi that he was more worth saving. You can tell it was shitty, because Levi wasn't moved at all and just wanted them to move out of the way so he could save Erwin. 2) Like I said, everyone who wasn't daydreaming about the story knew more or less that this was what would happen. It's a logical outcome for shounen manga where main protagonists don't often die and the young replace the old. 3) Erwin's last moments were shitty but I think he died in an honorable way still. Or at least he did to anyone who wasn't there to see him die. It will be known that he died 'fighting for the survival of humanity' and 'heroically' and no one will remember him in a bad light. From the outside perspective of someone who wasn't there, it's pretty good. Regarding 4) and 5), I agree with you as well, but unlike you that's exactly why I enjoy this story. If you look closely at the characters, you realize that almost all of them are selfish people who only care about their loved ones and about their own goals and interests. I mean, Mikasa straight up said in chapter 48 ('Somebody') that she only cared about Eren and Armin and that she'd kill anyone else who'd get in her way. So I don't see how anyone is shocked by her behavior here. Sure, Levi is her comrade and superior and distant family member, but when it came to Armin's life, she didn't hesitate to point her sword at his throat and to threaten him. Even though some characters are portrayed as 'protagonists' and some as 'antagonists', I don't really see any of them as either of these things. It's an ambiguous story and all the characters are fighting for something they care about and are trying to get rid of those standing in their way. All of them have done some pretty questionable things as well. Eren and Mikasa are always irrational and confrontational and violent when sh-t really hits the fan and this chapter was no exception. And maybe I'm odd, but all of those reasons are precisely why I like SnK so much. I like the drama and I like the fact that most of them are not 'good' people. I think it's very representative of human nature.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Man, everything about this chapter was great. The despair in Mikasa's and Eren's eyes as they selfishly tried to convince Levi that Armin was more worth saving... The expression of sadness on Hange's face as she checked Erwin's eyes to see if he was truly dead... The cry of despair that came out of Berthold's mouth when he called for Reiner's and Annie's help as his head was about to get crushed in between Titan Armin's teeth... The tears on the faces of the members of the SC as they were watching that happen... I think I scared myself a little for enjoying it so much. Maybe there's something wrong with me lol. In all cases, I want more! More chapters like this please. This was absolutely brilliant from Isayama. The despair in everyone's eyes, the selfishness, the erratic and confrontational behavior, people dying in brutal and cruel ways... Yes. Just yes.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I mostly agree with you. Little time has passed in their world, so there's that, but it's true that we still generally expect the main characters to grow and evolve. To Eren's credit though, even though he's still annoying and irrational at times, I think that moment down in the titan compound under the church was a big developmental moment that changed him a lot. At first he was depressed and even suicidal, but then he came to accept the burden that his father had placed on him and the new information he learned helped him understand that the situation he's facing isn't as black and white as he had initially believed. Mikasa, on the other hand, has not changed at all. I hope that Isayama will have a good explanation for that. Come to think of it, Levi and Kenny don't seem to have changed much either, so maybe there IS a reason...</TEXT>

With the amount of incredibly close calls that Reiner had, I'd be tempted to say it's the latter. Also, iirc at the start of the manga it's said that Reiner is 'strong-willed', so perhaps all the close calls that he had are supposed to represent the idea that 'the guy just won't die' or something like that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There's definitely a few things that don't make sense to me about those wall titans. I feel like we're missing a big piece of the puzzle. First, one theory is that the wall titans are there to keep humanity in check, which is why they're facing inwards. But why would that be needed when the King can simply erase the memories of the majority? Second, one theory I've read is that the King had intended for humanity to one day be turned into an army of mindless titans that he would raise to fight against his enemies. But why use regular mindless titans if he already has an army of giant titans inside the walls? I think it has to do with what Rod Reiss said. He said that the King had the power to easily defeat the titans, but that he wished for humanity to be ruled by them instead. But why? This is one of the most important questions for which we have no answer. Also, like I said, why did the King need those wall titans to keep humanity in check when he could just erase people's memories at will? Either we are completely wrong about the purpose that these titans served, or there was something about humanity that the King was really scared of, to the point that he thought an army of giant titans might one day be needed to fight them. Also, people from outside see humanity as a 'defiled race' and want to exterminate them at all cost. Why? I feel like this is all interconnected. The King was extremely scared of this majority race and the outsiders want to wipe it out. What is it about them that made so evil in the past?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's one of the things that have been bugging me the most. The fact that these wall titans seem to only rely on radiation from the sun as a source of energy. We know that the chemical substance the titans are made of is highly volatile. We've never seen it evaporate in a closed system, but we do know that it can undergo sublimation, which is only possible when a substance has such high vapor pressure that it can vaporize before its fusion point is reached. We also know that it undergoes phase changes extremely quickly, and for two reasons. First, as Hange pointed out, in its liquid phase the molecules escape into the air in a matter of nanoseconds. Second, as we've seen countless times, the solidification process happens also in a matter of nanoseconds, which we can also tell from the significant amount of heat released every time. Overall, this hints at a highly efficient chemical substance, which would explain why it can easily be powered by some organic structure in the human body, and in the absence of that, by radiation from the sun. However, based on what we've seen so far, if the wall titans rely on energy from the sun as their only source of energy, that they cannot be like the typical titan shifter that we've seen so far. In other words, there's no complete human body inside of them. Furthermore, it's also said that the mindless titans can also function at night because of reflected light from the sun... But in the real world, while the moon does produce thermal radiation, it's so insignificant that it's usually ignored altogether when it comes to real world applications. So if the mindless titans can actually be powered by reflected sun light, then the substance they're made of breaks the laws of physics. Once again, some things don't add up, but it does make me wonder whether these titans are actually shifters at all. Currently, the story has no explanation for why titan shifters wouldn't be able to move without sun light.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, it does make sense. Otherwise, how could the First King have ensured that humanity would continue to be ruled by the titans even long after his passing? We don't know why he believed that, but it must have been the only way. Maybe the memories are also passed down to show his descendants the events of the past that justify keeping humanity enslaved, but he thought that if this wasn't enough to convince them, then the idea that humans would otherwise be annihilated by those wall titans would definitely be. However, King Uri said that the world would soon end... Could that be because there's also an ultimate time limit? That is, a period of time after which the wall titans come out to exterminate everyone no matter what happens?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Definitely the best chapter made to date by Isayama in my view. It will take me a long time to write the wall of text that fully explains why, but this chapter had it all. Eren and Mikasa were as irrational and confrontational as ever, Levi and Hange continue to be f-cking bosses, we got a new badass character introduced, Erwin's character was given some closure, Berthold received the Marco treatment, and most importantly, we got meaningful plot advancement!! Sh-t truly hit the fan really hard and all the characters reacted somewhat predictably when it did, but I'd say that is a GOOD thing. I would have liked for more new information to be revealed about the story's universe and the titans, but I also understand that the setting of the chapter didn't allow for that. Can't wait to see how the story turns out from there on! Events of next chapter are a big mystery now and I love it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>All of your theories are plausible, I would say. First, we know that the Hometown want to wipe out humanity in its entirety. We don't know if they're even aware that the walls are filled with titans, but killing everyone within them is pretty much what I would call 'dissolving' them, as once all the humans are dead, those walls presumably serve no purpose anymore. Second, we don't know if there's a 'timer' on those walls. But what we do know is that whatever is eventually going to cause the end of humanity is something that even the Coordinate power cannot stop. We know that from King Uri, who, even though he had that power himself, told Kenny that the world would soon end. For your third idea, it seems to be the least plausible one, as I see some problems with it. First, we don't know the full extent of the Coordinate power, but I think it's unlikely that it allows the user to simply remove all the titans from existence just like that. What's more likely is that the person with that power can create and control a massive army of titans that no one would be able to stop. Also, more importantly, there's no evidence that the Coordinate power can control titan shifters in any ways. Back in chapter 50, RB and Ymir 'felt' the Coordinate power when Eren used it, but they weren't controlled by it. It's possible that it can only control mindless titans that were made from humans of that same majority race. Finally, I don't think there's such a thing as 'good' or 'bad' guys in SnK. It's an extremely morally ambiguous story, and most characters have a tendency to act selfishly and have done some pretty questionable things. However, we do know that the First King wished for the humans within the walls to be ruled by the titans and to live in ignorance of the past. Why? Is it because humanity did some horrible things in the past? Who knows. We also know that the other races view them in a negative light. The noble bloodlines within the walls see them as a race of 'slaves', and Reiner has called them a 'defiled race'. This definitely hints at some dark history. In all cases, it's not fair to call the humans of humanity 'evil', as they don't even have any knowledge of whatever horrible things their ancestors might have done.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There's a few things that don't add up just yet in the story about that power. Rod Reiss said that only a Reiss can use the power to its full capacity, but what does that mean concretely? In other words, what are the things that a Reiss with the power can do and that someone not from the bloodline can't? Both the Hometown warriors and Eren's father seemed to be convinced that someone from not the Reiss bloodline could still use that power effectively, so it's possible that it's only one of the power's 'features' that can only be used by the Reiss, and that all the other features can be used by anyone with the knowledge of how to do so and with enough practice. That's just speculation though. We don't have enough info to confirm anything just yet.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Also, the one thing that currently throws all the Coordinate theories out the window is Zeke's ability to control mindless titans. We know that the Coordinate power can control humans from the majority race and and certain mindless titans. It's pure speculation, but maybe the Coordinate power can only control mindless titans that were made from humans of that same majority race as well? But the real question is, what is the difference between Zeke's power and the Coordinate? RB and him were referring to that power as '**the** Coordinate', implying that there's just one. And Rod Reiss also said that the Coordinate is the strongest of all titan powers. Based on that, it's possible that the ability to control mindless titans is actually not that uncommon among shifters, and that the Coordinate power has something to it that allows the user to do much more than just that, which would explain why it's said to be so powerful.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Like you said, whatever is fated to happen to humanity, the shifters definitely know about it, hence why they want to 'save' Eren and Historia. There's a great deal of evidence that the Reiss family also came from outside the walls like the Yeager family (something I've discussed recently in another [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShingekiNoKyojin/comments/4wes3t/manga_spoilerswhat_are_your_theories_on_what_they/)). But one thing that I do find interesting, as you also pointed out, is the fact that the Reiss themselves are not immune to the Coordinate's 'memory-wiping' power, unlike the other minority bloodlines within the walls. I'm realizing that literally now as I'm typing this, but if I'm correct and the First King did in fact also come from the Hometown, then it's very likely that people outside the walls are also affected by the Coordinate. I think we might end up finding out that the story is almost entirely about racism and racial discrimination. We know that there are multiple human races in the SnK world, and that the majority race within the walls is discriminated both by the minority bloodlines and by people from outside. One of the nobles, when talking to Zackley, said that humans from that majority race have 'the blood of slaves'. Maybe the First King wished for humanity to be ruled by the titans simply because he saw them as an inferior race of slaves that didn't deserve any better...</TEXT>

    <TEXT>We don't know what happened, but it probably has to do with religion and racial history. There's a lot of evidence that those who founded the society within the walls were super religious people. In the inside cover of the graphic novels, the story says something along the lines of 'Within these walls are the ideals of humanity. Within these walls, let us create a world eternally without strife.' Also, when King Uri obtained the Coordinate power, he told his brother to (Rod Reiss) to pray. We don't know what justified enslaving the majority race within the walls, but it's very possible that it's a religious motif.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Actually, the story likely takes place in the equivalent of modern day Central Europe. We know that landscapes such as ice plains, deserts and oceans are all very far from human territory. Geographically, this would place the walled world in Central Europe. This is also where pre-Christian Germanic societies and Norse folklore came from, and we know that the story is heavily based on all of that, so it makes sense.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well, there's a few things that make me believe religion plays an important part in the story. It's not just that Uri talks about praying. It's that all the important Reiss members seem to hold some kind of religious discourse. Uri talked about praying, Frieda said that all humans were sinners, and Rod said that the person with the Coordinate power was God himself. Secondly, like I said, in the graphic novels it talks about how the people who created the walled world wanted it to be 'free of sins'. This hints at some kind of religious belief. Thirdly, and most importantly, the main religious movement within the walls, the Wall Cult, also happens to be the group of people who know the secret of the titans. Coincidence? I think not. I don't know if the First King and the other people who founded this society had any religious beliefs, but at the very least they did use religion to establish it and to maintain control over it. I see this as a parallel with the real world. Religion was for a very long time used to keep the masses in ignorance and to explain various natural phenomena that science couldn't yet explain. Similarly, in SnK, religion seems to have been used to justify the reality in which people live (a world where titans are feared) and to cover up the truth about the titans. For example, the Wall Cultists didn't want people to discover the titans within the walls, so they said that the walls were 'sacred' to prevent anyone from touching them.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I find that he's very morally ambiguous and unpredictable character. I have no idea what the author is going to make him do. The most likely outcome is that he fights the Survey Corps again and dies at the end of the story. Personally, I would find that disappointing. He might be an enemy of humanity now but he's still been one of the most important characters in the story, and I would love for the author to give him some crazy unexpected storyline. I would love to see him either change sides or become a higher ranking member of the warriors' society and come back as a warchief/leader of other titan shifters. Most of the main characters are still young, so if there's a significant time skip at any point it would be cool to see them all become much stronger.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I agree with you that there's no evidence Armin has received anyone's memories. But it's hard to say whether the ability to pass down and receive memories is related to the Reiss family, to the Coordinate power or to both. I used to think that it was related to the Coordinate power itself, since Eren also seems to have received some of Grisha's memories even though the latter wasn't a Reiss as far as we know. But the thing that made me doubt that theory is what happens in chapter 68 when [Historia kills her titanized father](http://mangafox.me/manga/shingeki_no_kyojin/v17/c068/39.html): she receives some of his memories. I can't explain that one at all. Was it just a 'literary tool' kind of moment, or do the Reiss all have an inherent ability to share each other's memories and that's not related to the Coordinate power? Can't tell for now.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've thought about that, but the problems with this idea are a) that the flashback is shown after Rod's death and b) that we see Historia's eyes in the first panel of the flashback, which implies that said flashback happens in her mind. In all cases, it's not really clear. It would make more sense if those were indeed Rod's final thoughts, but to me it seems like it's not the case and that single scene has thrown all my Coordinate theories out the window. There's a few things that don't add up about the Reiss family as a whole. It's said that only the majority race can be mind-wiped, but we've seen that Historia was regularly mind-wiped by her sister Frieda. Is it only Historia who can be mind-wiped due to her mother being from that majority race, or rather, was that possible because the Reiss themselves are part of the majority race? Can't tell which one is right at the moment. Also, if it's not the Coordinate power, and rather, it's the Reiss members who have an inherent ability to pass down and receive memories, then how come Eren was able to get those memories through his father? To me, this suggests that the memory transfer thing is related to the Coordinate power itself. But if that's the case then how do you explain that moment when Historia received some of her father's memories when she killed him? There's many hints that the First Reiss King also came from the Hometown a long time ago, so does that mean that Grisha and Eren are distantly related to the Reiss, which would explain why they could also receive and pass down memories and use the Coordinate power to some extent? Seems very far-fetched to me, but I can't come up with a better explanation at the moment.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well, regarding how Historia could be mind-wiped, I have two theories. First, the most simple theory that I came up with is that the Reiss cannot be mind wiped but Historia could due to her mother being from the majority race that can be. In other words, she was only a half-Reiss and that made it possible for her to be mind-wiped. Second, a more 'advanced' theory that I've also come up with is that the Reiss themselves are part of that majority race, and that the Coordinate power is given to the person who is supposed to control or lead his own race. This would also explain why the Coordinate power only seems to work on humans (and titanized humans) from the majority race within the walls. We know that, aside from the person who has the Coordinate power, the Reiss themselves don't know the world's history either. But is it because the relatives of the First King were also mind-wiped, or because, like with the Ackerman and the other noble bloodlines, his relatives never told their own children about it? We don't know. Only time will tell.</TEXT>

I don't think any of them wanted to kill anyone anymore by the end, Reiner and Berthold just had to follow the order given by their warchief when he was there.

Even though some characters are presented as 'protagonists' and some others as 'antagonists', in reality there is no such thing in the SnK universe. It's a morally ambiguous story, and all of the characters are fighting for their own purposes and interests and none of them can be seen as 'truly evil'. It just depends whose side you want to be on. Also, I guess you could say it's a story about 'regular people forced to do bad things'. Clearly no one in that story so far wanted to be killing people, though all of them ultimately brought themselves to do so for various reasons.</TEXT>

He's also hesitated to kill Eren for a very long time, even though getting another titan to eat him would have made his mission either.

Their characters are both very similar and opposite at the same time. Very similar, as both were forced into the world of the titans by their parents and it has been both a curse and a blessing for them. Opposite, because Historia was a special girl forced into a normal life, whereas Eren was a normal boy forced into a special life. Also, since we now know that the First King was also a man who came from the 'Hometown', both of them have their ancestors living outside the walls and that's why the warriors want to 'save' them both.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Do RBA deserve to die for their actions against humanity? I don't know. I think the answer to that question is entirely dependent on one's moral values and views about the world, so I'm not going to address that. But my impression was always that the group of main characters, particularly the two male protagonists, were much less close with Berthold than they were with Annie and Reiner. Based on that, I always thought that if someone was going to die first, it would be Berthold. Have you noticed how Eren never talks about Annie? Whenever he brings up the subject of 'making them pay for their crimes', he always mentions Reiner and Berthold. It's never 'Reiner, Berthold  amp; Annie', even though he knows that she was with them. To me, this means that Annie being a traitor is sort of a taboo subject for Eren. It's a truth that he still hasn't fully accepted. Even though Annie was the most socially awkward of all three of them, Eren held her in high regard and thought that she was actually a really kind girl behind her 'cold-hearted lone wolf' persona. So when he found out that she was a warrior tasked with annihilating humanity, he was more shocked and confused than angry. Also, more importantly, he never associated her actions with the death of his mother, unlike Reiner and Berthold. About Reiner, I think it's simply that he's a really likable person. Even the manga explicitly states that he's 'adept at making friends'. As a soldier, he was the perfectly stereotypical example of a 'nice guy'. And his true self is also like that too, though he's also more fatalistic and cold-hearted out of necessity. It's hard to think of yourself as a good person when you've been raised by your own people to become a warrior tasked with killing thousands of innocents. Ironically, I don't think any of the members of the 104th Training Corps have been able to bring themselves to truly hate him. They want to kill him out of obligation rather than because of a personal need to see him die. Another thing about Berthold that I already mentioned indirectly is that he was the one who was the most directly responsible for the death of Eren's mother, as the piece of the wall that he kicked in his titan landed on his house. So in short: - Eren was close to Annie, and he didn't associate her actions with his mother's death - Reiner is just a really nice guy and it's hard to hate him - None of the members of the 104th Training Corps were as close to Berthold as they were to Reiner, and he was less likable than him - Eren had a more personal hatred for Berthold, as his actions directly caused his mother's death For these reasons, it makes sense to me that Berthold bit the dust first. I obviously can't predict what will happen, but I would not be surprised if Reiner and Annie end up not dying by the end of the story. I bet that Eren and Armin would even convince their comrades to spare Annie's life if the circumstances allowed for it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't know if she was closer to them, but considering that she met them when she was still a kid and that they spent five years together, it's not that far-fetched of an idea. Also, she taught Eren her unique fighting style and spared Armin's life even though, unlike Eren, she had no reason to keep him alive. This says a lot about how she felt about those two guys specifically. About Zeke, I'm not so sure that he needs to die just yet. While RBA were just kids brainwashed into believing certain things and sent on a mission against their will, Zeke was an adult all along, and was likely involved in the decisions that lead to that situation. So, because of that, yes I agree that he is way more to blame than them. But we still don't know why these people are doing what they're doing, so I prefer to wait until we know what their motivations are before condemning them completely.</TEXT>

We don't know whether it's based on the substance's inherent chemical properties, on the person's physical attributes, or on both. It's also possible that Berthold's titan was upgraded with other substances afterwards in the same way that Eren got the hardening power by ingesting a substance from a bottle. In all cases, there is no evidence that Armin will be anything like Berthold. He could be just a regular titan lookalike of himself.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Quick thoughts, I'm short on time. There's a couple of important things there. First, Isayama confirms that only a member of the Reiss bloodline can be like the 'Progenitor Titan'. He states, talking about Kenny Ackerman: 'And he gradually began to aim for the ultimate existence that can command the titans, the Progenitor Titan. **But it was impossible for him because of his genetic makeup**'. This is more or less what we already suspected. However, we also saw Eren use that power to a certain extent, so based on that I'd say there's two likely scenarios: - Everyone can use the Coordinate power, but only a Reiss can use it to its full power and/or use its most powerful features. - Eren is somehow a member of the Reiss bloodline. Also, this statement from Isayama adds to the evidence that all titan's powers are bloodline-based. We do know that there are different races of humans in the SnK universe, and it's possible that different powers originate from different bloodlines. And to clarify what I mean by that, the way I see it is: everyone can become both a 'mindless titan' and a 'titan shifter', and a shifter's titan can be upgraded through various means (for example when Eren obtained the 'hardening power' after drinking the substance from the 'Armor - Braun' bottle), but the titan that you originally get when you obtain the 'shifting power' is based on genetic makeup. I don't know how accurate that theory will end up being, but that's my idea of it based on what we know so far. Second, Isayama hints at the idea that the society within the walls was created in hope of ending the constant warfare that took place before. We know, from the [upside-down Japanese characters](http://calorescence.tumblr.com/post/51450703198/did-you-know-the-inside-covers-of-the-japanesel) in the graphic novels, that the world was already at war before people started being turned into titans in the old continent. Isayama states: '...and despite Kenny being a person who believes and has faith in power, the fighting had stopped. From that truth, Uri had a bit of newfound hope in humans'. There, he confirms what we already suspected as well, which is that the First King's philosophy was basically that the main race within the walls was a 'hopeless cause'. Even within the walls, where the true history has been suppressed, there are tales of a time when humans used to constantly fight each other. One of the goals of the First King was to put an end to that. Third, Isayama says he will finally tell us more about the warrior's society. About time! His definition of the words 'soldier' and 'warrior' are also very interesting. He says that warriors fight for their own ideals and do not care for things such as profit. It makes sense, as we know from chapter 71 that Grisha didn't know the concept of money before he came to the society within the walls. It seems that their society is vastly different from humanity. Finally, Isayama implies, as we also already more or less knew as well, that while Zeke is an important and high ranking member of the warriors' society, he might not be the 'big boss'. The interviewer asks him: 'If Zeke is the Levi of the Warriors, then who's their Erwin?' Isayama won't answer that question, but since he compares Zeke to Levi in terms of power and importance he plays in his own society, it's very possible that there's an even more powerful and/or even more influential titan shifter at the very top of their society.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's interesting that Zeke was born on August 1. We know that humans within the walls are said to 'have the blood of slaves', and in the real world the first day of August is the day on which slavery is abolished by the British Empire. Also, 'Zeke' is the shortened version of 'Ezekiel', the name of the main protagonist of the Book of Ezekiel in the Hebrew Bible. Ezekiel means 'May God strengthen him' in Hebrew, and he was a prophet who was exiled from Jerusalem to Babylon and who was asked to 'confront God's sinful nation' in Jerusalem. In the book it says that he received this message from God: 'I am sending you to the sons of Israel, to a rebellious people who have rebelled against Me; they and their fathers have transgressed against Me to this very day'. Don't know if I'm over-thinking it, but the name 'Zeke' represents a whole lot of foreshadowing to me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's been suggested that all titans are just transformed humans, but there's no definitive answer just yet. For the titan shifting process, there's no definitive answer yet either. When a human becomes a 'mindless titan', his entire body somehow becomes the titan itself except for a small part of the spine. And when a 'mindless titan' becomes a shifter, his human body 'reforms' somehow, but we don't know the specifics of how that happens. It's possible that that the transformations are two different substances with each their own chemical properties. When someone is a 'titan shifter', the transformation relies on the human body itself as a source of chemical energy, whereas in the case of 'mindless titans', the source of energy appears to come from outside, e.g. electromagnetic radiation from the sun.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No worries. Also, something interesting that I want to add is how the two substances (the 'mindless titan' and the 'titan shifter' ones) seem to both be highly chemically efficient. Hange mentioned that the 'mindless titan' substance in its liquid form 'evaporates instantly', meaning that its molecules easily escape into the air. And when the substance becomes a solid, it happens in a matter of nanoseconds and a large amount of heat is quickly released, which we can observe when a human turns into a titan. Also, when a titanized human returns to his human form, the 'titan substance' goes from solid to gaseous state instantly. This is a sign of highly volatile substances, as sublimation is only possible for substances which have such high vapor pressure that heating causes them to vaporize before their melting point is reached in a closed environment. We've always seen the transformation takes place in open space, but still, this is a sign that both the 'mindless titan' and the 'titan shifter' substances are closely related. Like I said, the only difference might be that the 'titan shifter' substance uses the body as a source of energy instead of 'absording' it in the process.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Some thoughts about your theory, in no particular order. Ever since the end of [chapter 50](http://mangafox.me/manga/shingeki_no_kyojin/v12/c050/47.html), I've always wondered if the entire story so far hasn't been the past history of humanity narrated from the perspective of one of members of the 104th Training Corps, possibly Eren or Historia. First, 'At the time, we didn't understand the course of action that Ymir undertook...' sounds a lot like something that either one of those characters would say, and it implies that the events of that chapter were taking place in the past. Second, 'Historia' is an ancient word that means 'inquiry' in Ancient Greek and 'written account of past events' in Latin, so it would make sense for her to be the narrator. Finally, you could argue that almost all the events that have taken place in the story were from the perspective of either Eren, Historia or both characters at the same time. I don't know if the story is taking place literally 2000 years into the past, but there's some hints that it's a story that takes place into the past and that's being narrated by someone who was there most of the time and who has knowledge of many of the important past events. About the First King's motivation and the true history, I think the creation of the walled world was at least in part motivated by a desire to end the constant warfare between the races. We know that the old continent from which humanity came was already torn by war before people started being turned into titans. We also know that the 'First Reiss King' also came from the 'Hometown' a long time ago and took the 'Coordinate power' away from them somehow. Since he had that power, the man who became the first king of the walled world must have been an important member of the warriors' society. Grisha implied that their people were also decimated by war, and it's possible that the First King and other members of that society were in disagreement on how to end war and on what to do with the 'race of slaves' that's also the majority race within the walls. So because he had envisioned a different world, the First King turned his back on his people in order to create the society that would best fit his own ideals, that is, the society that would eventually become the walled world in the current story. I don't know what the origins and nature of the 'titan's power' are, but I'm pretty sure that the ending of the story, 'the truth' as Isayama has called it, has to do with racism, warfare and religion. We know from the [graphic novels](http://calorescence.tumblr.com/post/51450703198/did-you-know-the-inside-covers-of-the-japanese) that the First King had envisioned a world 'free of war and free of sins'. We also know that most humans within the walls, who are regarded as inferior by other races, all came from the same enslaved race. It's also hinted that this race became enslaved due to having a history of 'being evil', that is, of committing all sorts of atrocities against others. It's possible that the First King wanted to humanity to live in fear of the titans simply because he believed that they shouldn't be allowed to live freely. In one of the more recent chapters, Berthold says that they must all die as it's 'way too late'. This was ambiguous as usual, but to me this suggests that in the past the warriors' society might have had a different idea of how to 'save' the 'evil race', but that it's way too late to save them now, since they've been manipulated by the power of the king for multiple generations.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In my opinion, Eren's and Annie's titans are the most suited for small scale warfare and solo missions. Berthold's titan is enormous but very slow, which means that a much smaller but also much faster titan like Ymir's could easily defeat him in the right environment. Also, a group of fast-moving humans (i.e. the members of the Survey Corps who use the 3D maneuvering gear) can simply stall him to the point of exhaustion, as we've already seen. Inversely, like I said, Ymir's titan thrives in specific situations (for example in aerial combat, such as in a dense forest with lots of tall trees to jump on), but can be defeated even by mindless titans in most environments. Reiner's titan is well proportioned in terms of size like Eren and Annie, but the fact that it's covered with hardened skin makes it heavier and thus slower and harder to maneuver, which explains in part why Eren can beat him in single combat. It also explains why the fast-moving members of the Survey Corps could get him out of his titan using the 'thunder spears'. In short, Berthold is slow because of its size, and can therefore be stalled indefinitely by smaller but faster opponents. Reiner is also slow (albeit still much faster than Berthold), and therefore struggles in single combat and against fast-moving opponents. And Ymir can probably defeat anyone with sheer speed alone, but only in specific environments. All of them have glaring weaknesses that explain why they emphasize the importance of working as a team. On the other hand, Annie's and Eren's titans are well proportioned, not too big to the point that it drastically reduces their speed and maneuverability, unlike Berthold, but also not too small to the point that they can be defeated by larger mindless titans, unlike Ymir. And unlike Reiner, they're also not burdened by weight. They have the potential to excel at single combat, they can be fast enough to defeat fast-moving human opponents, and they could theoretically simply run away from much bigger and much slower titans like Berthold's. In other words, they aren't disadvantaged in any situation. So which of the two is superior? As of right now, I'd put my money on Annie any day of the week, even if Eren now also has the hardening ability. Like Annie herself said, the fighting techniques she uses do not rely mainly on strength, and Annie's abilities in single combat are far superior to Eren's. In fact, she made quick work of him every time they fought. She was also fast enough to easily deal with fast-moving veteran members of the Survey Corps, and we have yet to see Eren do something like that. Eren and Annie might have a 'student and master' relationship, but in this case, Eren hasn't given us any reason to believe that he, as the student, is anywhere close to the level of his master just yet. Regarding Zeke, it's hard for me to evaluate his 'power level', because I feel like we have yet to see the full extent of his abilities. But I would say that he's more of a 'long range' type. He appears to be very strong and his aim when throwing projectiles is ridiculously good, but he doesn't seem particularly fast or adept at using single combat techniques. A single combat expert like Annie could probably beat him in a one-versus-one fight. Also, more importantly, he doesn't fight 'fair' at all. He can summon a horde of mindless titans from seemingly out of nowhere (like we see [here](http://mangafox.me/manga/shingeki_no_kyojin/v18/c074/35.html)), and more importantly, his 'mount/cargo titan' helper guy is actually a formidable opponent on his own, as he has both human intelligence and the physical abilities and features of a non-human animal at the same time (and in our world, other animals have physical abilities that are far superior to those of humans... we're just superior to them due to our vastly superior intelligence). Obviously, since Eren has the power that is supposed to stand above all other titan's powers, he might be the strongest titan shifter. But he doesn't know to use it, so we can't take it into consideration.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Honestly, I don't know what to think about this. On one hand, I agree with you that it would be pretty shitty for the remainder of Levi's storyline to be about obsessing over killing Zeke, especially considering that the character has so much potential as you pointed out. Also, I want Levi to kill him because he legitimately believes that he should die, not just because he made a promise to Erwin that he would do so. But on the other, I'm asking myself, how much character development can we realistically expect from Isayama? It's my understanding that he hadn't planned to do very much of it until the story started really taking off in terms of popularity. From where we are right now, considering that there might be less than thirty chapters left, can we really expect Isayama to extensively develop all eight remaining members of the 104th Training Corps along with Armin, Levi and Hange? We love all of these characters and we'd also love to learn more about them, but I think that's the expectations that you should have if you want to end up being sorely disappointed. In my view, there's no way that characters outside of the main trio are going to get as much development as we, as readers, feel that they deserve. It just isn't the focus of the story. So I'm torn between two different types of expectations. I don't want Levi's entire character development from now on to be related to this promise he made to Erwin, but I'm also wondering if expecting any more than that isn't simply being unrealistic. However, five years ago I also would've never thought that supporting characters such as Levi, Erwin and Historia would end up getting as much development as they did, so like you said, sometimes Isayama does surprise us in good ways. There's also the problem of the potential Mist ending. We know that this was the original ending planned by Isayama, and we're not quite sure that he has moved away from that ending, even though at some point he did say very explicitly that he would. It's possible that the vast majority of the main characters will die by the end. The Mist ending would also be very fitting, as the SnK universe is heavily based on Norse mythology, and in the Norse conception of the universe, one of the central concepts is Ragnar #246;k, the cyclical end of the world. Basically, every once in a while, the world is literally destroyed and then reborn. It's implied that this has actually already happened at least once in the SnK universe, as Ymir said that she had 'died' and been given a second chance. In Norse mythology, this is exactly what happens: Ymir is sacrificed by the gods to create the world, and then reborn as a human after Ragnar #246;k. There's many other hints that some kind of 'end' is coming as well. One of the most notable ones is in one of Kenny's flashbacks, when Uri says that they're at 'the twilight of humanity'. Ragnar #246;k means 'Twilight of the Gods', so it's very possible that whatever major disaster is about to happen in the story is a reference to that. In all cases, like I said, it would be very fitting for most people in the story to die, and then for the few survivors (which would probably include Eren) to rebuild a new world using the titan's power. I'm not saying that it's what's going to happen, but we should definitely avoid getting too attached to any of the characters, as it's not too unlikely that they'll all bite the dust by the end.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I would say that's not the case, simply because this guy doesn't look like he's new to being a titan at all.

    <TEXT>You should re-read [chapter 44](http://mangafox.me/manga/shingeki_no_kyojin/v11/c044/4.html). The submission technique that he uses to corner Reiner before Berthold blows himself up on them is the exact same technique as the one that Annie teaches him in the flashback scene that we see in that same chapter. We don't see her teach him ALL of the moves he knows, but it's implied that he learned all of them by training with her during the training corps days, as in that same chapter he also says 'you guys taught me how to fight'. Also, that was the only real submission technique that Eren has used successfully so far. In his second fight with Reiner, he throws a hardened punch at him and he holds his leg on the ground for a while, but he doesn't corner him like he did in chapter 44. Their second one-on-one fight never finishes, as the rest of the Survey Corps eventually strikes him with the thunder spears. Honestly, I think Isayama has made it clear that Eren's success against Reiner is ironically mainly thanks to Annie.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Since we know so little about Ymir, I like to rely on Norse stories where Ymir is one of the most important characters and has a similar story to Ymir in SnK at least based on what we know so far. - Ymir's physical appearance makes her gender a little ambiguous, although we do know that she's a girl - gt; Ymir was a hermaphroditic giant who reproduced asexually. - Ymir said that she 'died' for the happiness of many people - gt; Ymir was slain by its own grandchildren, the first generation of gods, who used its body to make the world (literally). - Ymir said that she had been given a second chance, and she regained her human form after eating Marcel - gt; After Ragnar #246;k, the cyclical end of the world, Ymir was reborn as a human. And that's only the most obvious similarities, but there are many others as well. Overall, the events that take place in SnK prior to the start of the story are almost identical, in a metaphorical sense, to the events that lead up to Ragnar #246;k, the 'Twilight of the Gods', in Norse mythology. Like I said, Ymir comes back as a human after the cyclical end of the world. One of those 'ends' occurs after Surtr, the leader of the fire giants, rides from the south with his hordes of giants to invade Asgard, the walled realm of the gods. There, he fights and kills the gods Freyr and Freya and is also killed by Freyr in the process. At some point, he literally engulfs the world in flames with his blazing sword, which is how the physical end of the world occurs. In SnK, the physical appearance of Grisha's titan closely resembles that of the giant Surtr (see [here](http://i.imgur.com/2qBuZYa.jpg)). We also know that he was an important member of the shifters' society, and that those shifters come from the south, due to the fact that they attack the southern part of the walls. When RBA first attack the walls, Grisha goes to the Reiss family and kills Freya and then takes her power. Shortly after, he dies by giving that power to his own son. At the same time, the world inside the walls becomes a 'living hell' and Ymir regains her human form. You can see the parallels. This is definitely not a coincidence. Based on that, we can assume that the story of Ymir will end up being very similar to the story of Ymir in Norse folklore. I believe that the story of how Ymir itself is created will end up being represented metaphorically in SnK. The Norse creation myth states that, at the beginning of time, there are three entities: Muspelheim, the world of elemental fire (from where Surtr and the giants of fire come from), Niflheim, the world of elemental ice, and in the middle, Ginnungagap, a giant abyss of nothingness. Ymir, the first giants, is formed when the two elemental worlds meet, and from Ymir's sweat, the first giants are born. Ymir's grandchildren use its body to create the world, and this is how the eternal feud between giants and gods begins. In SnK, we know that many of the titan's powers, including the 'Coordinate', originate from the shifters' society, in the south. It's possible that, in the past, the shifters combined their knowledge with another group from the north in order to create what would become the first titan's power. And Ymir would have somehow been involved in that creation process. At this point, there are already too many parallels between the Norse creation myth and the story in SnK. In my opinion, the creation story of Ymir will undoubtedly be represented in some way by the end of the story, and it's probably what is referred to as 'the truth' by Isayama in interviews.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The short answer to that question is that we don't know yet. The titan's physical appearance seems to be in part based on the person's phenotype (observable physical characteristics), meaning that when a person turns into a titan, they become a titanized lookalike of themselves. This is obvious, as all titan shifters so far look somewhat like themselves as humans when they turn into a titan. But other physical characteristics, like body hair, height, hardened skin, etc., as well as 'special abilities' (for lack of a better term), like the ability to control certain titans, seem to be based on something else that we can't explain yet. For example, yes Berthold is slightly taller than the other main characters, but that alone can't explain why he is five times taller than the average titan when Ymir, who is only slightly shorter than him as a human, is half the size of an average titan. There's also the case of Zeke... why is his titan covered with hair like a non-human primate? There's no explanation for that. It's possible that there are different types of 'titan shifting powers', or that the original shifting power can be upgraded through various means. An example of the upgrade idea is when Eren got the ability to harden his titan like Annie after ingesting the 'Braun - Armor' bottle in the Reiss compound. One important question is: do these additional powers or upgrades become integrated with the titan's power itself? We will find out when we see Armine turn into a titan for the first time. If he is as tall as Berthold, then it will be an indication that whatever made Berthold's titan unusually tall was a part of the shifting power that can be passed to another person by ingesting the shifter's spinal cord fluid as a 'mindless titan'.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Isayama said that Ymir's life is one of the story's biggest mysteries. It's part of what he calls 'the truth' and which will probably only be revealed at the end of the story. It wouldn't be possible for someone to spoil you even if they wanted to, since nobody knows the answers to your questions. Even manga readers don't know a whole lot about Ymir. We might have already figured it all out by looking at Norse stories (since the story of Ymir in mythology is so similar to that of Ymir in SnK based on what we know so far), but that's just speculation.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I can explain why it's like this. As we know, the story of Shingeki no Kyojin is mainly based on Norse mythology. The 'Hometown' society is a reference to the fire giants from Muspelheim, the world of fire, which explains why their titans have this 'fire red-ish' look and release a lot of heat. Grisha Yeager is based on Surtr, the leader of the fire giants. His titan's physical appearance is very similar to him, as you can see [here](http://i.imgur.com/2qBuZYa.jpg). Also, his story is almost identical to that of Surtr as well. In one Norse tale, Surt and his horde of giants ride from the south (which symbolically represents heat and fire) to the walled world of the gods in order to wave war on them. Surtr fights the gods Freyr and Freya in the center of the world. He both kills and is killed by Freyr. After the war, the world is destroyed and then reborn, and the progenitor titan Ymir is reincarnated as a human. Similarly, in SnK, the warriors invade the walled world from the south (which we know from the fact that they attack the southern part of Wall Maria). Grisha goes to the center of the city and kills Freya and most of the Reiss family. Not long after, he dies by giving Freya's power to his own son. Around the same time, the 'mindless titan' Ymir regains control of her human form by eating the warrior Marcel. The concept of heat, as it related to titan's powers, has a double meaning. First, like I already mentioned, it's symbolism for the fire giants which wage war on the gods in Norse mythology. Second, it represents the chemical nature of that power. As we've seen, an individual is turned into a titan when a substance of unknown nature is injected into their body in its liquid state. When the person 'becomes' the titan, the substance undergoes solidification and the titan itself is the result of that substance's solid state. Now one basic chemical principle is that, in order for any substance (except helium) to go from a liquid state to a solid one, its temperature must be lowered enough to reach its freezing point. As temperature goes down, heat is released, and when the freezing point is reached, the molecules start becoming more and more compact until the attractive forces between them can no longer be overcome and they start forming 'clusters' that will grow in size until the entire substance has an orderly structure. This is just an oversimplification of how it works, but you get the point. This is what gives the solid-state substance (i.e. the titan body itself) its fixed shape. In the case of the titan transformation, you can tell that the state change takes place extremely rapidly due to the large amount of heat that is released. By deduction, it's very likely that all of the titan's powers come from the 'Hometown' society, since heat is a concept that unifies all titans in the story so far, and like I've already mentioned it symbolically represents the Norse fire giants, which that society is inspired from. We also know that all the 'shifting powers' come from them as well, since Eren, Ymir and the 'First Reiss King' all took their powers from them. In the case of Eren and Ymir, it's explicitly stated, and in the case of the king, it's heavily implied that he also took it from them, as the warriors keep talking about 'taking back' the Coordinate power, implying that it once belonged to them.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I looked at the statistics for all characters and realized that the categories that were ubiquitous to all of them were combat, initiative, wits and teamwork. I wanted to know: if you add up the score for each of these categories for every one of the 'main characters' (the three higher-ups of the Survey Corps, the 10 members of the 104th Training Corps, and Armin and Ymir), how do the characters rank? This is the result. Other interesting stats include - 'Intelligence' or 'Smart', for which Hange and Zeke rank the highest, both at 11/10. - 'Ruthless' for Erwin, at 10/10, hence why he was called a 'demon' by Levi. Some quick thoughts on each character: - Erwin: the highest ranking character, it makes sense that he was the commander. - Hange Zo #235;: a close second to Erwin overall, it makes sense that he named her his replacement. - Mikasa: one of the strongest overall characters, but not a very good teammate. - Reiner: slightly inferior to a lot of aspects, but a far better teammate. - Marco: same thing as Reiner. - Levi: held back immensely by his inability to work with others. - Jean: kind of the same thing as Levi, he's held back by his lack of ability to work with others. Possibly the most underrated character. - Bertold: held back by his lack of initiative. - Annie: the female equivalent of Levi. - Eren: An excellent fighter, but I wouldn't have given the Coordinate power to someone who lacks wit and teamwork. - Ymir: also held back by her inability to work with others, but she should have been in the top 10. - Armin Arlert: if he learns how to fight, he will become a monster. - Historia: also one of the most underrated characters, she's just as good of a fighter as Connie and Sasha and ranks higher in everything else. Probably should be on the battlefield, not in a castle working as a puppet for the Survey Corps. - Connie and Sasha: their stats are average, I don't have much to say about them at the moment. I guess they complete each other well, since Connie makes up for Sasha's lack of initiative and she makes up for his lack of wit.</TEXT>

They'll bring some of their more experienced warriors, and if they're as powerful as Ymir hinted, then Eren needs to get to the basement ASAP so he can learn how to use the Coordinate power. Another thing to keep in mind is that the Reiner we've seen so far was the Reiner who hesitated to actually kill any of his former teammates and who didn't even want to kill Eren. A Reiner who's angry because of Bertold's death and who's actually intending to kill people could be a very, very different opponent. He's supposed to be as strong as Mikasa, but he hasn't given us any reasons to believe that so far, and I speculate that it's due to the fact that he was unconsciously hesitating to kill anyone up until now.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My theory is that the power to turn humans into titans and then control them is not that uncommon, but that the 'Coordinate' is the most potent version of that power. Let's assume that the walls are in fact filled with titans, and that these titans are actually shifters who used their titan's power to make the walls. Do you think that these people would have willingly encased themselves within the walls for centuries? I don't think so. What's more likely is that the First King had the power to not only control mindless titans but also titan shifters as well. He ordered those people to use their power and raise the walls, and when they come out of their slumber and find out that they've been stuck in there for over a century, they're going to be pretty pissed.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Just because she went along with Reiner and Bertold doesn't mean she betrayed humanity. In fact, she saved Erwin's life even though she was angry at him for ruining her plans. She also saved Historia's life multiple times and Connie's life at least once back at Castle Utgard. Nobody understands why she took that course of action, but she never really did anything that directly caused harm to humanity. In the end, I think she just did what she thought was best for Historia and herself. It's true that she withheld a lot of information about the titans from humanity, but it's not like she did that out of malice, it was simply to protect herself. I see her more as a 'neutral third party', and as someone with motivations that neither the main characters nor the reader can currently understand due to a lack of knowledge about the story's universe. And I think that even Eren was smart enough to realize that he lacked the knowledge to understand why she did what she did, which is why he refrained from judging her, like you said. Eren's current mindset must be that, since he sees Historia as a friend, he's going to see Ymir in a positive light for her sake until he has clear evidence that she's not a 'good' person.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Realistically, there's only two possible scenarios. The first one is that she sides with humanity. From there on, I don't know what happens, but Eren and Armin are influential enough within the Survey Corps that she would be spared if they make a case for it. The second one is that she doesn't side with humanity, in which case she probably gets killed somehow down the road. Maybe the warriors save her and she manages to escape, meaning she doesn't die right away, but regardless I don't see a happy ending for Annie unless she has a change of heart. I do hope that we'll get to see one last Annie vs. Eren showdown before the end though. edit: Isayama said in a recent interview in the 'Answers' data book that he would be writing about the warriors soon. If Annie's going to be reintroduced into the story, it would make sense if it was during that arc of the story, possibly at the end of it once we've learned more information about her past.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For those who are wondering, the title of that fan drawing is a reference to the title of chapter 47, titled Children. The title itself is a reference to the fact that the chapter's main characters are the five titan shifters at the time: Berthold, Reiner, Annie (not present but she's one of the main topics of discussion of the chapter), Eren and Ymir.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I can't wait to see [this one](http://imgur.com/a/wLdR1). Easily one of my favorite scenes in the story, as it showcases Reiner's mental issues really well. First, he casually blows his own cover at the worst time possible and while being deep in enemy territory. Even Eren, who's not the sharpest tool in the shed, is like 'dude, you're either joking or batshit crazy'. Then, a few pages later, we find out that it's the latter, and it's a really epic moment because as the reader you go from 'wait, what?' to 'holy sh-t!' in a few seconds, and instantly you know that it's a turning point in the story and that a big battle is about to go down. At the time, I also felt bad for Eren because of this. I thought that Reiner and Bertold were probably not the only shifters hiding within the military and that Eren would end up having to slaughter most of his own comrades. I was wrong, but he was still deeply shaken by Annie's and Reiner's betrayal. He's probably going to kill all of them, or at least he'll kill Reiner too at some point. Still not sure about Annie though, because he never explicitly stated that he wanted to kill her as well, he only said that he'd kill Reiner  amp; Bertold.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Interesting theory, but I don't think that each of the factions has a 'Coordinate power' like you say. What's more likely is that all the titan's powers, including the Coordinate power, originate from the warriors' society. One direct evidence is that it's been repeatedly hinted that this power once belonged to their people. First, both [Reiner](http://mangafox.me/manga/shingeki_no_kyojin/v12/c050/41.html) and [Zeke](http://mangafox.me/manga/shingeki_no_kyojin/v19/c077/23.html) have talked about 'retrieving' the Coordinate power, implying that it their people used to have that power. Secondly, how does Zeke [know the name Reiss itself](http://mangafox.me/manga/shingeki_no_kyojin/vTBD/c081/7.html) even though he had never been in contact with humanity prior to the start of the story? Reiner and Berthold could have given him that information, but as far as we know, they didn't know of that name, in fact, they didn't even know Christa's real name. What's more likely is that he knows that name because the First King also came from that society. Furthermore, Reiner wants to save Historia, implying that he knows she's from a family that's not from the 'evil' majority race within the walls that his people want to annihilate. But there's more than that. We've seen many different titans so far. Most of them are mindless, with no control over their own body. And we've also seen the 'shifters', some of which are vastly different from each other. But the one thing that's ubiquitous to all titans is the concept of heat. As you may know, the story of SnK is widely based on the pre-Christian Germanic conception of the world. In our world, heat is a merely a measure of energy that is spontaneously transferred from a hotter body to a colder one. But for ancient Germanic peoples, it was symbolism for the fire giants from Muspelheim, one of the nine worlds in Norse mythology. In the old Germanic tale of the end of the world, the fire giants ride from the south (which metaphorically represents fire and heat) to the walled world of the gods in order to wage war on them. The leader of the fire giants, Surtr, goes to the center of the world to fight the gods Freyr and Freya. Surtr and Freyr ultimately kill each other. After the end, the world is 'reborn' and the progenitor giant Ymir is reincarnated as a human. In SnK, all titans always [attack from the south](http://attackontitan.wikia.com/wiki/Walls#Trivia), which is symbolism for the Norse fire giants. And when the warriors (RBA) launch the attack on humanity, they also attack from the southern part of Wall Maria (see [here](http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/shingekinokyojin/images/c/c5/Map_of_the_Walls.png/revision/latest?cb=20160618141643); as you can see, Shinganshina District is the southernmost district). And when they do, Grisha Yeager, whose titan [resembles](http://i.imgur.com/2qBuZYa.jpg) the giant Surtr in physical appearance, goes to the inner city to fight Freya and Reiss family. He kills Freya, and then dies by giving her power to his own son. Around the same time, the 'mindless titan' Ymir regains her human form by eating Marcel. As you can see, the story of the warriors' society is definitely based on the tale of the fire giants in Norse mythology. And just like heat is symbolism for those fire giants in Norse mythology, it's very likely that the concept of heat that is ubiquitous to all titans in SnK represents the fact that the titan's power originates from the warriors' society.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's definitely my favorite fictional view of the universe. And it must have been Isayama's too, since the story is absolutely full of Norse references. I can give you a mini-list of the biggest ones to give you a starting point for your readings: - The walls as the walls of Asgard that were built by a giant - The division between humanity and the world of the titans as the innangard ('inside the fence')/utangard ('outside the fence') division between the orderly world of humans and the other worlds - Historia and [the fence](http://mangafox.me/manga/shingeki_no_kyojin/v16/c066/5.html) - Ymir's [sacrifice](http://mangafox.me/manga/shingeki_no_kyojin/v10/c040/39.html) - Ymir on the concept of [fate] (http://mangafox.me/manga/shingeki_no_kyojin/v10/c040/28.html) and how it can be changed (ancient Germanic peoples saw fate as changeable) - The events that take place at Castle Utgard - Grisha Yeager and the warriors as Surtr and the fire giants - The Ackerman as the warriors of the god king Odin - Blood rituals and self-sacrifice - Many others that go beyond the scope of this thread. In general, many of the Norse themes are recurring within the story. Most of the main characters' last names are Germanic. The world within the walls is situated in a place that is geographically similar to Central Europe, the birthplace of Norse mythology. The titan shifters and titans are all humans, a reference to the fact that both the giants and gods are descendants of Ymir. Most of the story at the beginning is based on the tale of the fire giants during the cyclical end of the universe, Ragnar #246;k (literally: Twilight of the Gods). The First King is seen as evil by the warriors, because he broke the balance between the innangard and utangard worlds, which in Norse mythology is what precipitates Ragnar #246;k. The concept of attainment of power and knowledge through self-sacrifice. The idea that destiny is not set in stone. A form of magic (the whole memory-wipe thing) that can forcefully change people's destiny. Etc. Like I said, there's just so many things that it goes beyond the scope of my comment here. But hopefully this gives you a starting point. :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>We don't know how memories and the titan's power are related just yet, so it's all speculation at this point. But, even without any memories, what I suspect is that Armin will become scared and somewhat paranoid in the same way that Ymir was. She said that their power was 'absolute' and that whether she was inside or outside of the walls, there was no where for her to hide. The entire Survey Corps got nearly wiped out by their warchief and two of their less experienced warriors, so I'd say Ymir's fear was justified. Armin is probably aware of that and will also understand that he's now a target, since he took their weapon just like Ymir did in the past. He also has the titan's power, but he's different from people like Eren and Historia whom the warriors won't kill for unknown reasons.</TEXT>

The names of the Norns are really fitting for Germanic culture for a number of reasons, but the names of the Walls in SnK don't appear anywhere in Germanic tales. The only similarities is that there's three names and that all of them are feminine. edit: also, some crazy thought I've had: what if the mysterious writing that only Ymir could read is related to the magic runes?</TEXT>

In all cases, I guess we'll find out in the year to come. I'll try to dig up more information in the meantime.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I said this in another thread, but I think there's only two possibilities. 1. She decides for some reasons to side with humanity. Eren and Armin are probably influential enough within the Survey Corps to convince the others to spare her life if the circumstances allow for it. 2. She doesn't side with humanity. In that case, she will fight Eren again and possibly be killed at some point. Regardless of what happens, we will definitely see her again and we will definitely also learn more about her past as Isayama starts writing about the 'warriors'. But I personally see scenario 2 as more likely. In the interview from the 'ANSWERS' data book, Isayama says that there are fundamental ideological differences between the soldiers and the warriors. The soldiers are fighting for their leader, whereas the warriors are fighting for some greater purpose that has to do with their ideology and how they view the world. Based on what we know so far, I can't see how they could ever be allies. Regardless of how she feels, in the end Annie will never side with the 'race of slaves' inside the walls.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>What I liked most about this episode is that it stayed true to the story's Germanic roots. The titan calls the girl 'Ymir-sama'. 'Sama's is an honorific used when referring to someone of a higher rank than oneself. This is a reference to the fact that Ymir is the progenitor of all giants in the Norse creation myth. Also, the titan buries the girl in a tree. Here's, there's two references. First, the tree itself is a reference to Yggdrasil, the world tree that holds and connects the nine worlds together. But it's also a reference to the Norse conception of time. Unlike Roman languages, Germanic languages have no future tense, only a past and a present tenses. In Norse mythology, Yggdrasil, which represents the present, grows out of the Well of Destiny, which represents the past. And everything is cyclical rather linear, including time itself. Figuratively, this is represented by the flowing of water: water flows out of the well and into the tree, and then returns to the well as dew from the tree's dripping leaves, and so on. When the gods and the giants face off in one final battle, the world will be destroyed and then reborn, and Ymir will be reincarnated as a human in the process. Based on that, you can say that the titan is burying 'Ymir-sama' in a tree so that she can return to the well and then come back to life when the cycle of life restarts.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Something to keep in mind is that they are teenagers. You can't expect people their age to act consistently or rationally all the time. In fact, you can't expect that from human beings period, but when people are young and inexperienced, that tends to be even more true. They made a lot of mistakes that older and more experienced fighters would have most likely never made. They had the power to swiftly annihilate the entirety of humanity within the walls, but they never did. Like I said, it's because they made a lot of mistakes, but is it also because they couldn't bring themselves to do it? I've re-read all of the chapters recently, and I've sure noticed like you that Berthold always makes concerned facial expressions when Reiner acts like a 'soldier'. We obviously can't tell what he's thinking, but it's clear that he's noticing Reiner's increasingly strange behavior and thinking that it's not right. While Reiner is clearly experiencing guilt and all that, Annie is a weirder case. There are times when she seems to genuinely care for others and to experience guilt over their actions as well, and she even makes friends with some people within the walls (like Eren). But there are other times like you said when she seems to also genuinely enjoy killing people and being a warrior. Even though in the long term it was Annie's mistakes that cost them the most (she trained Eren and spared Armin's life), at the time that they started messing up it's probably Berthold who was the most at fault. He saw that Reiner and Annie were starting to have an emotional breakdown of some sort. He seemed to be the least emotionally affected of them, and yet he did nothing. What happened with Marco should have been his wake-up call that something has gone wrong with their collective state of mind and that they need to retreat before they actually make a costly mistake. Did he do nothing because of his own lack of assertiveness? Maybe. It seems like all he ever did for most of the story was just following Reiner around. Or is it because he, too, found himself wishing that this was actually their life? It's probably a bit of both. In all cases, they were clearly not mentally prepared for the mission they had to carry out, even though they did have the power to do it. Infiltrating the walls and acting as 'soldiers' was a huge mistake. For what you said about Annie being like the walled people, we can only speculate once again. What Reiner said suggests that she's more closely related to the race within the walls than the rest of them. It's possible that she's even actually a member of that race but that her father joined the warriors a long time ago. But we don't know, and in spite of that Reiner still seems to care about her, so it might be a complex situation. We really need more information before we can talk about that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Even though SnK is widely based on Norse mythology, this seems to be the exception. 'A perfect game' is definitely a reference to baseball, and baseball definitely isn't mentioned in Norse mythology. But it's hinted that there are multiple worlds (whatever that may mean), so it's possible that the other worlds are vastly different from this fabricated world in which humanity lives. We know that the walled world has been 'stuck in time' for at least 100 years, since that's when the walls were raised and things haven't changed at all since then. Things can have changed a lot in the 'real world' over a period of 100 years. The warriors' society might merely be the result of people being allowed to progress socially and technologically in the SnK universe. They drastically improved the 'titan's power' technology and invented some new sports. That's plausible. It's hinted that the way people live within the walls isn't actually the way other people live in the story's universe.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; A theory I'm thinking of is that the Reiss family had some sort of connection with the warriors for some time. This could even be older than the walls history though. And after sometime, things got bad between them and thus cutting off their supply of serums. So if this is true, the Reiss (or atleast the coordinate) knew that at some point Wall Maria could be attacked, and yet they chose not to do anything about it. This is more or less the most prevalent theory among the community at the current time.. And there's good reasons to believe that. Why do you think that Reiner wants to save Historia? Likely, it has to do with the fact that she's not from the same race as the other humans within the walls. Also, more importantly, the story of the warriors in SnK is based on the story of the fire giants in Norse mythology. What do all titans have in common in the story so far? They rely on heat as a source of chemical energy. And heat is also one of the main symbols for the Norse fire giants. This is also why titans always attack from the south in SnK. In my mind at least, there is no doubt that the Reiss family is somehow related to the warriors.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Based on what we've seen so far, this chapter seems to only confirm what we already know. There is definitely a society outside the walls, and their technology is far more advanced than within the walls where the advancement of science has been suppressed for over a century by those in power. Grisha knew all of this, because he himself came from outside the walls and never forgot those things. This still doesn't answer any of the important questions. This is basically Isayama making the main characters become aware of many things that he's been hinting at for the past couple years, which is great for the progression of the story, but still no 'big reveal'. I'm going to enjoy this chapter, but it'll be because we get to see the characters' individual reactions to this information, not because there's anything new. Also, based on what we know about Grisha's life, this is other information that you can expect to be revealed in his writings found in the basement: - Their society doesn't use actual money as a currency - Humans were at war long before the walls were made (we know this from the secret history from the inside cover of the graphic novels), and the titans started appearing as a result of the endless warfare - The walled society was made in part to end that endless warfare</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well, it makes sense. We've seen that the titan substance is highly chemically efficient. When it undergoes solidification(which results in the individual becoming a titan), the phase change happens in less than a second and releases a large amount of heat. The substance can also undergo sublimation, meaning that in a closed environment it has such high vapor pressure that it vaporizes before its melting point is reached, and it evaporates really easily, meaning that its molecules have a high escaping tendency. If I was to make a wild guess as to why this particular titan(which is unusually big) causes its user to sweat constantly, I would say that it's simply because the substance's boiling point is so low that heat has to constantly be released from the body in order to prevent it from becoming a gas.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't think there is a single theory. It's just that a lot of the story is based on Norse mythology. The concepts of oath, attainment of power thru self sacrifice, destiny, moral ambiguity, the fence, the fire giants, the twilight of the gods; the stories of Odin and the runes, Ragnar #246;k, the Norse creation myth, Utgard-Loki at Castle Utgard, the fortification of Asgard, etc... All of these things served as inspiration to SnK.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Some speculative information about the Ackerman family: we know from Kenny's grandfather that the Ackerman used to be a group of warriors close to the royal family. As I speculated in [another thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShingekiNoKyojin/comments/4zqzaa/manga_spoilerstheory_on_the_origins_of_the_three/), the story of the first Reiss king is very similar to that of the king of the gods Odin in Norse mythology. Similarly, it's possible that the Ackerman warriors are based on the Norse berserkers. The berserkers were shamanistic warriors who served Odin, and some of them were said to enter a trance-like state that granted them superhuman physical abilities when going into battle. I've always thought that either the Ackerman warriors or the titan shifters were based on the Norse berserkers, as there is evidence for both. Also, we know that there is possibly another group of warriors who served the Reiss king and who went on to become the 'titans within the walls'. But the story of the Ackerman warriors is very similar to that of Odin's warriors in certain aspects.</TEXT>

If none of those geographical features are within the territory, then that places the walled world in a region that is geographically similar to Central Europe.

    <TEXT>It depends what you mean by 'strict'. Weight and body composition are in large part a function of kilocalorie intake from food. It's a big misconception that you can achieve a lean and muscular body by eating specific foods. Of course what you eat has an impact on overall health and it also regulates appetite, hunger and all that, but gaining muscular mass and losing fat are mainly directly regulated by *how much* you eat when it comes to diet. Having more testosterone in your body changes the game, because it increases energy expenditure and makes the body invest a bigger percentage of said expenditure in building and repairing muscle tissue. In other words, you can, for the same number of calories, gain more muscular mass while also gaining less fat at the same time. To directly answer your questions, yes she uses exogenous testosterone and yes this physique takes years to build. But you're mistaken if you think that she's on a stereotypically strict diet of chicken, brown rice and broccoli everyday. What's way more likely is that she's on a calorie surplus when she wants to gain mass, and then goes on a deficit to lose the newly gained fat sometime before her competitions, like most bodybuilders do. The steroids allow her to gain more muscular mass than is naturally possible, and to maintain more of that mass while she's on a deficit afterwards.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You're talking about sex, a biological phenomenon. Our species has males and females, and both are necessary to create offspring, that's something everyone knows. But gender is a social construct. It has deep evolutionary roots, but it's becoming less and less relevant in the world of today. Technological progress makes it so that you don't need a 'man' and a 'woman' to produce offspring anymore. So I think it's time for us to come to terms with the fact that it was never as simple as that. Why do so many people identify as 'transgender' or 'gender-nonconforming'? It's because it's a complex system that isn't so binary that you can simply put people into either one of two categories and just call it a day. What do you think is more accurate, a series of texts that were written thousands of years ago, or what we can observe in the environment today? I think the answer is obvious...</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't have a lot of time right now, but from skimming through the leaks quickly, it seems that the war that happened before the walls were made (and which is mentioned on the inside of the graphic novels) was between two societies, Mare and Erdia. The Fritz family is apparently the one from which the titans originate, but they were discriminated against by the people of Erdia for 1700 years. When the last Fritz king died, the people of Erdia used his power to make a new society. But the people of Erdia were 'evil' and they regarded the other races as inferior and forced them to make kids. At some point, the people of Mare fought the people of Erdia and ended up winning and taking most of the titan's powers that the members of Erdia had themselves taken from the Fritz family. But the war lasted over 80 years, and most people died and most of the land was destroyed. The king of Erdia and other surviving members of that society left the destroyed land for an island called 'Paradise' where the king built walls for his people, and the surviving members of Mare were left behind (this is Grisha  amp; friends). Here's where it gets unclear, though. It seems that the people of Mare have rebuilt since then and now they want something on that Paradise island. The leaks refer to it as 'fossil fuel for their machinery', though I think this might be a metaphor for something else. Overall, this matches what we knew about the story already from the graphic novels. A big war involving the titans, a lot of people dying, etc..</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So now that I have more time, here's some more information that I have uncovered. Don't know how accurate this is, but a lot of people are saying that these leaks are legitimate. It's up to you to decide whether this is true or not for now. Even though the Reiss family has been ruling within the walls in recent times, we know that the Fritz family had been ruling humanity for thousands of years before that. The chapter reveals that, 1800 years prior to the start of the story, the first Fritz king, apparently named Ymir Fritz, made a pact with some being that is referred to as 'the Devil'. In exchange, his family received what we know as the 'titan's powers'. It's not explained what he actually did, but this may explain the title of the first chapter, 'To you 2000 years from now', as well as why Berthold called the Survey Corps 'the descendants of the Devil'. The Fritz family (and the people they ruled) lived in a place called 'Balati' which was said to be 'the base of the titans'. At some point, Grisha's father helped the Fritz family, and in exchange he also received 'the power of the Devil'. Because of that, his children Grisha and Faye (who was indeed Grisha's sister) also had that power as well. The Fritz family was also at war with another people known as 'Mir' and, in order to defeat them, they had to revive an being known as 'Elodia', who was also called 'the original titan'. Faye was sacrificed in order to revive that being. At some point after that, Elodia was resurrected and then sent to Balati, and there was a war between 'Fritz's people' and 'Mir's people' that lasted over 80 years. This may explain why Grisha said something along the lines of 'at least you guys aren't fighting constantly' when he first met Keith Shadis. At the end of that war, most of the land had been destroyed and most people were dead. The surviving members of Fritz's people left Balati and settled on a new island called 'Paradise' where some king (unclear from which family he was) built walls to protect his people. Also, during that war, the people from the Mir had stolen most of the titan's powers from the Fritz family and the surviving members were left behind with that power. The descendants of these surviving members are presumably RBA. Since that time, Mir's people have apparently rebuilt and they want to use the vast amounts of natural resources (or 'fossil fuel', this might actually be a metaphor for something else) hidden under the Paradise island in order to improve and expand their war machinery. Grisha's books found in the basement contain the history of the Fritz family, the history of the being Elodia and the history of the Mir. There's some other important information about Grisha as well. His first wife, Donna, was also a Fritz. And it's unclear how he and Zeke are related, but Zeke is said to be of royal blood as well (implying that Donna was his mother). When he was 7 year old, he went to the government and revealed a secret of Grisha and Donna. Because of that, they had to flee. It's not mentioned what happened to Grisha's wife after that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't know what happened to Grisha's first wife, but I'm starting to believe Zeke really was her son. The translations I've read state explicitly that 'Grisha married Donna Fritz' and that 'Donna had Zeke'. It's possible that Grisha spent a long time as a mindless titan like Ymir did, hence why Zeke appears to be the same age group as him.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Looks like the leaks were mostly true. Grisha's sister was taken away by the military guys from the Mare. His first wife was Donna Fritz and his first son was Zeke. His own father was a sympathizer of the Fritz family, he didn't discriminate against them like the Mare. Also, this original titan, Elodia, did exist, and that base of the titans also existed as well, but all this stuff happened long before Grisha's time. That was a story told to Grisha and he chose to believe it. If I was to take a guess, I'd say Grisha's first wife, as well as his parents and comrades, were all eventually killed by the Mare. He's had a tough life. Now it's easier to see why he did the things he did. Also, on a side note, in [those panels](http://yonkouprod.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/snk_86_31.jpg) we see Berthold's and Reiner's dads.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So I knew that it would end up being a story of racism and discrimination. I also knew that the world within the walls was based on Central Europe in terms of geographical features. But I never thought that Isayama would draw so many historical parallels with Nazi Germany and the Stalin regime. The story just took a somewhat unexpected turn for me. Is it possible that RBA have been calling them 'the descendants of evil' in a similar way as to how the Nazis used to call all jews evil? Also, Zeke being a snitch on his parents reminds me of how children used to be encouraged to report their own parents' crimes to the police in Germany... There's too many parallels for this to be a coincidence.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So I have thought of something. We learned that, after the death of Eldia, the Original Titan, his 'soul' was split into nine titan powers. What if the way to revive Eldia is to gather the nine titan powers into the same 'vessel'? Is that what Grisha had intended to do with his son? By giving the royal family's titan power to Eren along with his own, he would already have two of the nine powers. And with these two powers, he might have thought that he would be powerful enough to get the other seven and revive Eldia. I wonder if that could have been Grisha's ultimate goal?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I understand Grisha's actions now... Zeke was not the son he had hoped for, so he entrusted in hopes and dreams to Eren instead. Come to think of it, why did he Grisha give his own titan power to Eren along with the King's? As we know, the original titan, Ymir, split her power into nine different titans when she died. I've already said this in another post, but I think that Grisha's ultimate goal was for his son to acquire all nine titan powers. With such power, he would become unstoppable, even in the face of technological advancement, and he would be able to reclaim the glory of Ymir's people. Does anyone else think that?</TEXT>

What if Ymir is the only living person who can read the content of that book and uncover the truth? The Mare is saying that the Elodians were monsters when they had the powers of the titans, and Grisha and the other Elodians are saying that this is a lie, that the Mare made up this story in order to justify taking their powers and prosecuting them. Someone has to be lying here.</TEXT>

And I can tell you, there are many aspects of the titan's power that don't follow the laws which govern our universe, so a scientific explanation just isn't possible. Like you said, if Isayama attempts to give us the typical sci-fi explanation, it will probably be disappointing. I would much prefer either a fantastic explanation or no definitive explanation at all.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My prediction is that there is another big war coming in the story. We know that the Mare expect to be in competition over natural resources in the near future. But in competition with who? Certainly not the Elodians. It seems that there are other societies like the Mare in the SnK universe and which we have yet to hear about. A bit far-fetched of an idea, but what if Isayama has decided to push the Nazi Germany parallel even further and the story ends in a world war due to the competition over fossil fuel and the Mare's expansionist ideology?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah but it's implied that the power of the progenitor titan can control all other titans, which means that the Mare would be at risk of losing the titan powers in the face of someone who can use that power effectively. Also, Ymir might be one of the only people alive who can still read those ancient texts in a mysterious language and which apparently tell the true history of Elodia.

    <TEXT>The more I think about it and the more you're right. In the modern 'Hollywoodian' times Odin is usually portrayed as a warrior, but the Norse Odin was nothing like that. He was, like you said, a gender-ambiguous magician who led powerful warriors into battle and thirsted for knowledge (even going as far as to giving up an eye in his quest for the runes). And yes, 'the Hanged' is reference to the nine days he spent hanging from the branches of the ash tree. Odin was also said to be immensely intelligent, and at times a tad cunning and sadistic. I can definitely see Hange's character being based on him, especially now that she's leading the Survey Corps. But in Norse mythology Odin is also eaten by the wolf Fenrir, I wonder if Hange will meet a similar fate?</TEXT>

They are massively behind in terms of scientific knowledge and military power. And there's no guarantee that Eren can save anyone. So if there has to be any kind of happy ending for the Survey Corps, something major needs to happen in the story. Some kind of power-up needs to be given not just for Eren but to the military within the walls as a whole. Like the thunder spear technology but an order of magnitude more powerful. Even if Annie somehow changed sides, I don't feel like it would make a significant difference.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think you're right about Reiner. It's more likely to be for personal reasons, no matter what the connection between the Reiss and the Fritz families is. But when it comes to those two families, I still feel like we're missing some important piece of information. Rod Reiss said that only those who are of the Reiss family can use the progenitor titan's power to its fullest potential. We can't tell for sure whether he was right or not, but even if he was wrong, we've also been told explicitly by Isayama that the one who raised the walls and erased the memories of the first generation to live within them was King Reiss. Furthermore, like you pointed out, Zeke himself knew of the surname 'Reiss' and referred to the king as 'King Reiss' and also knew of the memory wiping he had done. And now, in last chapter, we're told that the royal family is the Fritz, not the Reiss, and that the king who left Elodia to raise the walls on Paradi island was the Fritz king. How do you reconcile those two versions of the story? Clearly something doesn't add up. Are the Reiss and the Fritz two names for the same family? Or are the Reiss a family closely related to the Fritz family? Or is it that something else entirely is going on? There's no way to tell.</TEXT>

Eren (Freya+Grisha) + Annie + Reiner + Armin + Ymir + Zeke + 'Quad Titan' = 8. I would be disappointed if the last one has just been lost somehow. Here's to hoping we'll see another unique titan before the end of the story, that would be much more exciting.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've already said this, but I think now would be a good time for Annie to be reintroduced into the story. We need a different, fresher perspective on what's going on out there. I'm sure she thinks no better of the Mare than Grisha did, but Grisha's vision was also shaped by a long life of hardships.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well, to be honest, I only said that what Grisha's intentions. I don't think the SC would necessarily do it even if Grisha said that it was the only solution. I guess it comes down to whether Isayama wants the main characters to die or not.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Some key points about this chapter: - This is probably the most important point, **we still don't know the truth.** Were Elodians really evil when they were powerful, or did the Mare twist history after winning the war? Impossible to tell for sure at this point. - Mikasa came from another society that is also an enemy of the Mare and some members of this society sided with the Elodian king because they thought the 'Coordinate' power thought would be enough to defeat the Mare. - The 'Female Titan' was indeed Dina Fritz, as we suspected. Also, that Elodian friend of Grisha's who got eaten by mindless titans looked a hell of a lot like Reiner to me. His father perhaps? - Kruger is also the guy who let Grisha watch the zeppelin as a kid and who told him how his sister had died. - If Kruger was 'The Owl', then he is also the one who gave Grisha that ancient Elodian book written in another alphabet and which supposedly tells the true history of the Elodian empire. If he did give him that book, it's possible that he could read it and therefore actually knows the truth. If he revealed that truth to Grisha before dying, then Grisha also knew of the world's true history and if he did, then I'm guessing we'll find out about it relatively soon, as it'l be in one of the books that he wrote. This is purely speculation but if I'm right, the implications are huge: whatever this 'truth' is, it would have motivated all of his actions from that point. On the other hand, it's also possible that Kruger couldn't decipher that book himself and gave it to Grisha hoping that he would do it for him. In that case, the truth will have to come from somewhere else, because Grisha obviously didn't know any better than him. - It seems that Kruger didn't want the other Marleys to know that Dina Fritz was of royal blood, even though he knew that she was about to be turned into a mindless titan and had no intention of stopping that from happening. By deduction, there is two possible reasons for this. First, he knew that royal Elodians can use the 'Coordinate' power and was hoping that mindless titan Dina would somehow be turned back into a human/titan-shifter by the Elodians within the walls. If that's the case, well, that obviously failed. The second more likely scenario is that he didn't want them to realize that her son, Zeke, is also of royal blood. I wonder what Kruger had planned for Zeke, there's no way to tell right now.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You're right, thanks for pointing it out, I fixed that. 'From the east' likely only refers to Mikasa's people, not Levi's. The Ackerman people probably also came from another place as well, but I'm pretty sure there's no mention of that in that chapter. But I'm also pretty damn sure that 'the people from the east' is the people she's descended from from her mother's side.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Given what we know now, I don't see how the manga could end on a positive note. The Marleys in power are never gonna change their views. Even if they did twist history and the Elodian empire wasn't really 'evil'... there is no going back from this lie they've created. And even if the Survey Corps retrieve more of the titan's powers and Eren ends up being able to control the titans inside the walls, then they might decide to attack the Mare and in that case, countless innocents will die. No matter how you look at it, regardless of who comes out victorious, this will end in a bloodshed.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>But Isayama stated in the past that the story would end tragically. It shouldn't come as a surprise that it might actually end this way. I think it would fit the story's 'cruel' universe as well. Also, from a literary perspective, it makes sense for titans to have at least this shortened lifespan weakness. They are so overwhelmingly strong compared to humans, it's only fair that there's a price to pay for that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So it turns out that the 'Coordinate' has a literal meaning. The titan powers are connected to each other in some kind of invisible Euclidean space, and the entities that connect them travel as lines on the x, y and z axes of that space, or as invisible 'paths' as Kruger calls them. And the Coordinate is named as such because it's a point in that 3-d space where all the 'paths' meet. It's a point in an invisible coordinate system that none of the characters seem to understand, not even the Marleyan scientists. That's pretty cool. Didn't expect this from Isayama.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm sorry if you already came up with this theory, I haven't kept up too much with what's going on in the community lately. To me it seemed logical, as soon as the term 'physical space' came up, that there was some time travelling involved. But I wanted to wait for more evidence because I know that the community is skeptical about time travelling stuff. I think people still are, even despite this new evidence.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The one thing I'm wondering is whether there was something more 'special' about her that made her be used by her master in the first place. In the letter, I felt like she was simplifying her explanations, like she knew more than she was letting on but wasn't allowed to give more detail because Reiner wouldn't let her. I'm still suspecting that she was used for more than just her Eldian origin, though, like I said, she didn't give any detail regarding how exactly she was used as a 'public attraction'. After all, Isayama said a while back that she supposedly 'held the key to the story', so I don't think that it's the last we've heard of her or that what she wrote in the letter is the whole story. I could be wrong though. Like some people pointed out, it's also possible that she was a perfectly regular Eldian and that would be fine too.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, I don't think it works like that. Most drivers probably don't have the educational background necessary to become an engineer overnight. It would take years of re-education, and that's assuming that all of them would be willing to go back to school, which seems even less likely.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, that's possible. Or maybe she did exist, but even her original story has been highly romanticized. She could have been a titan shifter, but neither the first person to have the power of the titans nor anyone special aside from the fact that she had that power.</TEXT>

To quote the article: "Though it has the potential to transform life on Earth, metallic hydrogen could also play a key role in helping humans explore the far reaches of space, as the most powerful rocket propellant yet discovered. "It takes a tremendous amount of energy to make metallic hydrogen," Silvera explained. "And if you convert it back to molecular hydrogen, all that energy is released, so it would make it the most powerful rocket propellant known to man, and could revolutionize rocketry."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For me this chapter was dark and frustrating. It's basically the calm before the ultimate storm. Like some people have pointed out, the fact that Marley isn't sending 'mindless titans' anymore means that the game has definitely changed. The Survey Corps should be worried right now. Eren is playing an extremely dangerous game. In all that time, he never revealed the truth about the Coordinate and Dina Fritz, Historia and Eldians of royal descent in general, which means that he may never gain the ability to fully use his powers either. And as much as Historia has always been my favorite character, his decision to protect her life potentially at the expense of the entire Eldian race is about as selfish as it can get. After one year, there's still no mention of Annie. This means that they still haven't figured out what's up with her being in a titan crystal. No mention of the 'wall titans' either. Furthermore, it looks like Armin still hasn't used his titan for the first time. So they've made no progress at all in a year when it comes to understanding titans, and on top of that they can now tentatively conclude that the enemy is preparing for some kind of full-blown assault. That's why I'm saying they should be worried right now. The most frustrating part for me was Eren casually talking about crossing the ocean to crush Marley. He knows that they're an entire civilization with vastly more advanced technology, and unlike his own teammates (whom he's been lying to), he knows very well that he can't even use the Coordinate in his own current state, like I've also said. So how can he be saying something like that?! Like with Historia, I really like Armin as a character, but I think that if Erwin would have been there, things would have gone completely differently. There's no way he would have let a whole year pass without doing anything. At this point, even though they are obviously unaware of Eren's lies, the Survey Corps is wasting the most valuable resource that they have, that is, time. I like to think that Erwin's strategic foresight would have prevented such a thing from happening. And so I'm saying that, in the end, they will only get what they deserve. If they get a happy ending then I'm happy, but if we get the Stephen King ending I would also not be surprised at all.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Here's their backstory, for those who are interested. It's the girl who wrote this: "We met on World of Warcraft in an LFG on January 29th, 2010 and were best friends instantly. I (the tank and the ginger) was from Canada and he (the healer and beard owner) lives in Minnesota so it took us four years before we met in person. Fast forward another three years, a dozen trips to see each other, and countless paperwork for a K1 Visa to immigrate to the US permanently, I moved to Minnesota last month on the 6th of January. And on the 29th, after seven years exactly, I married my best friend. Still feels so surreal."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Some info about this mod: As far as I know, this is by far the most demanding graphical mod in existence for Minecraft. Don't expect to be able to run your game at the highest settings and at a decent FPS (i.e. around 60 FPS) unless you have multiple high-end GPUs (like the Geforce GTX 1080) and a high-end CPU. The Continuum Shaders mod is actually a more powerful version of the Sonic Ether's Unbelievable Shaders (SEUS) mod, and it's stunning but it's definitely not for everyone. More info and downloads can be found on the mod's [website](https://continuum.graphics/).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm sorry dude, but saying publicly that someone on the team doesn't want to play with you was a bad idea. It creates drama in the eyes of the community, and it makes the fans lose confidence in your team. Also, a lot of people, who have obviously no insight into what's going on in P1, are now going to take sides, with some supporting you and others blaming you for any potential problems the team is facing. That in itself will create even more drama.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Actually, it's never implied that he did not find her attractive. My understanding is that he didn't see women as 'attractive' in general until he got older. At some point he probably did start finding her attractive (like you said, who wouldn't, she's obviously pretty), but what made him fall for her was that he realized how she had always believed in him since they were kids and even before he started becoming 'famous', unlike a lot of characters in the story. Or at least that's what I've come to believe, maybe I'm wrong. Also, by that point he had gotten over his crush on Sakura, which certainly helped as well.</TEXT>

However, for those who are interested, I can give the list of world gen mods I've used: -Biomes O' Plenty 5.0.0.2162 -Realistic Terrain Generation 4.1.2.4 -Alternate Terrain Generation 0.12.0 -GeographiCraft 0.7.6 -RecurrentComplex 1.2.10 -Natura 4.1.0.24 -Placemod 1.10.2 -Ruins 1.10.2 -BetterFoliage 2.1.3 -WTF's Expedition 1.4.1 There are others, but they are not as useful if you're not making a modpack. These are the main ones. Most of these are heavily configurable.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>She did look particularly gorgeous, but the reason no one is talking about it is because Hinata pretty much [always looked good](http://i.imgur.com/w47zdVq.jpg).

    <TEXT>Yeah, I tend to agree with that. Surely I'm not the only one who thinks Mitsuki is even a little on the OP side? According to his Narutopedia [page](http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Mitsuki), he can do senjutsu, kenjutsu, medical ninjutsu and summoning techniques, and he also has an insanely high chakra level. He's basically the real deal lol.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I must say, Sakura's character has really grown on me over the years, especially since the end of the Fourth War arc. In all honesty, when I was a teenager, I hated her character, and I wasn't very mature so I saw her as a 'cheap hoe' who served no purpose other than to have a cute girl in the story and who did nothing but yell and cry constantly. But now that I'm older I see things very differently. I particularly like how she slowly moved away from the stereotypical 'whiny manga girl' character and turned into a much more mature, considerate and open-minded woman. Also, her character grew up and matured at the same time as I did myself, and this has a really powerful meaning to me. I know this sub likes to love Hinata and loves to hate Sakura, and I can understand that, since I was like that myself for a long time. But I think the author deserves a lot of credit for sort of 'turning around' the character, for making her a much better adult woman than many of us might have anticipated she would become, say, seven years ago.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The mods involved in world generation: -Botania -Animania -Biomes O' Plenty -RecurrentComplex -Forestry -BetterFoliage -RailCraft -Tinker's Construct -Applied Energistics 2 -HarvestCraft -ActuallyAdditions -AgriCraft -Quark -Natura -WTF's Expedition -Roguelike Dungeons -Coral Reef -ReptileMod -GeographiCraft -Plants -Waddles -Essential Additions -StructPro -OceanFloor -Realistic Terrain Generation -Alternate Terrain Generation -Streams -Cyclic All with a lot of config modifications. The modpack will also come with integration for the Continuum Graphics mod's Cinematic mode (since it's a cinematic-making modpack), which is used in those screenshots. Other mods that affect the environment also include DynamicsSurroundings, AmbientSounds and Sound Physics (obviously not shown here). Finally, the resource packs used are: -WTFExpedition -Sound Physics (goes with the Sound Physics mod) -Faithful 32 Modded -Ragecraft Faithful (RCF) 64x64 -RCF - CGA -RCF - Clear Glass Addon -RCF - Random Mobs With this modpack, I'm not making performance a priority; I'm currently running this modpack at less than 120 fps with the highest graphical settings myself, and it will likely drop lower when I start actually making short movies with it. The aim is to create the most visually pleasing and most complete modded Minecraft experience at the cost of performance.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is the Continuum Graphics shader mod, which is a modified version of the more well-known Sonic Ether's Unbelievable Shaders (SEUS) mod. Continuum Graphics has a Cinematic setting made specifically for Minecraft movie-making, this is what I'm using in those screenshots. With this mod I've modified basically everything: water animation speed, water wave speed, water refraction animation speed, volumetric cloud speed, cloud shadow speed, cloud plane speed, waving leaves speed, grass movement speed, blur distance, blur intensity, flare settings, bloom effects, etc... You can have highly personalized graphical settings. This is also what I mean by shaders integration: the modpack will come with the Continuum Graphics mod and with the Cinematic settings that I believe give the most visually pleasing experience.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sildur's shaders mod is very good, no doubt about it. But the difference between Continuum shaders and the other shaders is that the former is simply more powerful and more customizable by a wide margin. But then again it's also more demanding on your hardware, so everything comes at a cost. Furthermore, Continuum Shaders is unfortunately not very well optimized yet, the developers themselves said that it has currently about 13,000 lines of code that are either useless or unoptimized.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey guys, Thought I'd share my modpack with you, since people seemed to show interest last time I shared my progress. Download it [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0Bxl1ykwAoXN2UTFlQUdZQzV1b0U) (Google Drive). It's in early development and I'm an inexperienced modpack maker, so expect a lot of bugs/crashes/things that don't make sense. If you see anything that could be improved, please let me know, I love to learn new things. I also have a private test server to play the modpack on, send me a PM if you're interested. Some more info about what this modpack features: - shader integration and custom shader settings (using Continuum and Ebin shaders, which were built with the intent of making shaders for Minecraft movie-making without compromises, hence the name of this modpack 'Limitless Machinima'). - lots of other client-side enhancements: better vegetation, better water, better sky, better weather, better ambient sounds, better sound, item and sound physics, custom music, etc. - heavily customized world generation, using various mods (BoP, RTG, StructPro, RecurrentComplex, etc.). - an all-purpose modpack: it has mods for role-playing, adventure, exploration, technology and automation, magic, etc.. The mod is not aimed at one playstyle or theme in particular, rather, it has a bit of everything (see the mod list or config files for more info, or you can also just ask me by PM). This modpack is a large expansion of the FoolCraft modpack. In general, it is aimed at Minecraft content-makers, youtubers, map-makers, etc., in other words, people with high-end hardware. It has a LOT of mods (some of which are probably currently unstable), and a ton of graphical and acoustic enhancements. Unless you know for sure that your computer can handle it, I would advise you to be cautious with using this modpack. It's definitely not for the average computer. In the future I want to make a light version of this modpack, but this will obviously take a long time. Let me know if you have any questions. :)</TEXT>

For more info you can just check my [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/feedthebeast/comments/632s75/progress_on_the_limitless_machinima_modpack_world/) on the ftb subreddit. Like I said it's in early development so expect crashes. Also the shader settings are for high-end hardware, so you should remove/edit the optionsof and optionsshader files before launching the game if you don't think your PC can handle it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>RTG is compatible with BoP and ATG, the configs for BoP are already documented and I made the configs for ATG. WTF's Expedition and GeographiCraft have built-in compatibility with RTG, and GeographiCraft also has built-in compatibility with BoP. BiomeTweaker and MineTweaker 3 are compatible with most mods. StructPro, Ruins and RecurrentComplex are also compatible with a lot of mods. I wrote a bunch of config tweaks to make this work. I used MTUtils, FTB Utilities and Wawla to help with the tweaks. I used Scanner and Simpleretrogen to test the world gen features. I also did a lot of biome gen tweaks with myBiomes, but it has more limited compatibility so I didn't do as much. That's about it. This took close to a month so far. Edit: and for Quark and DoomLike Dungeons, I only edited the already-existing configs. I mostly removed stuff but also added a few things. I did some slight tweaks to Coral Reefs and Plants Megapack, once again also editing the configs that are already there. For Plants Megapack, all I did was increasing the plant spawn spread and disabling a few items. That didn't take long.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>[Picture comparison](http://imgur.com/a/8v41O). Just to make sure that I understand correctly, this is the same person right? Isayama just casually revealed the identity of the 'Quadrupedal Titan', right? The Eldian who has its powers is this girl named Pieck. Just making sure that I'm not going insane. I love how this character has been part of the story for a few years now and one day Isayama just tells us its identity like it's no big deal. I guess it really isn't.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Am I the only one who feels like this may be the most casual reveal of an important character's identity that Isayama has ever done? I'm thinking that this contrast is actually intentional, no? Her identity is revealed in a casual manner to show how in the story's universe she's not really anyone important, just another Marleyan warrior who will die in a few years. But from the readers' perspective she's pretty important, since she's one of the only antagonistic characters of the last couple years (along with RBZ), hence this contrast.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2017-05-04 17:04:14</DATE>
    <TEXT>We used to think that Historia was 'useless' because she didn't have the power of the Coordinate titan within her, but since the latest chapter we now know that this is definitely not true. Zeke, who obviously never had the Coordinate titan, is considerably more powerful than other titan shifters due to his royal heritage. In fact, I would go as far as to say that the ability to control other titans who have been injected with one's own spinal fluid is inherent to all Eldians of royal heritage who receive the power of a titan. This is as-of-yet-unconfirmed, but if it's true, then it's definitely in the Survey Corps' best interest to turn Historia into a shifter. "But whose titan is she going to inherit?" you might ask. Well, you might dislike me for saying this, but the one I'm thinking of is **Annie**. I think that Historia is a prime candidate for inheriting the Female Titan, and I would go as far as to bet that this is actually what's going to happen as soon as they find a way to get Annie out of her 'crystallized form'. Sadly for a lot of SnK fans, this means that Annie's return would be pretty short-lived. But there are two other important reasons why I believe Historia will inherit the Female Titan. First, it's been confirmed by Zeke himself that the Reiss family is in fact the true royal family, and that they simply underwent a name change after going into hiding on Paradi island, as we predicted. This means that Historia and Zeke are the last two living Eldians of royal heritage, and more important that Historia is the only royal Eldian on Paradi. Second, she might have a personal motive for accepting to inherit the Female Titan, since it's the only way she could personally make Marley pay for killing Ymir. I'm not going to give my opinion about this. I know that there are people who have been big fans of both Annie and Historia for years now, so I will stay neutral. I'm just saying that at this point this looks like a very plausible theory.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Also a possibility, but I'm thinking that it would be more beneficial for the SC if Historia eats Annie, because if Galliard is on Paradi island it means that Marley is invading and in that case it's a bit late for Historia to start getting used to being a shifter.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>What was the reason for making Mitsuki OP compared to all the other new characters?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-05-11 23:08:51</DATE>
    <TEXT>My takeaway, after both reading the manga and watching the anime, is that Mitsuki was made to be on a whole different level than the other new generation kids. His nature transformation jutsu (lightning, wind, etc) is more advanced, his taijutsu is more advanced, his summoning jutsu is more advanced, and he can also use healing jutsu and kenjutsu (from the manga). Basically, he has it all. Even his understanding of mathematical and scientific concepts is more advanced, as we saw in the anime. And on top of that, he can also use Senjutsu (a first for someone his age in the Narutoverse, as far as I know), and even though he can't control it, I'm pretty sure that this would allow him to actually beat adult shinobi. I understand that he's far superior to the others because he was made using genetic engineering, but from a literary perspective, why did they create a support character that's far stronger than the others? Is it to have someone that Boruto and Sarada can eventually surpass? Or some other reason? I like Mitsuki's design, I think he's a cool character, but I'm not sure why they would make him as strong as he seems to be right now. In the anime, it's like everything that's been happening so far has been a joke to him.</TEXT>

Does this mean that Zeke turned against everyone in Marley, even his fellow warriors? I didn't expect that at all. Zeke is one cold blooded guy if that's the case. I also wonder what caused such a drastic change in his mind.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Maybe the agreement between Eren and Zeke was that the Eldian warriors would be spared by the trap, because they are like Eren, some kids who were turned into titans because they had no choice and who were manipulated by Marley. So yeah, like it's been said, maybe they're being trapped away both to protect them and so they won't try to stop whatever is about to happen. That would make sense.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Did you guys notice how Porco, Pieck, Reiner and Zeke are all, one way or another, getting away from the main scene? Yeah, something nasty is definitely about to go down near that scene, and I think that these people are not being made a part of it because of their titan power. It can't be a coincidence that only the current warriors are leaving. I can tell that this will be bloody. At least all of our beloved warriors are most likely gonna make it out alive, so we've got that going for us, which is nice. edit: Also, now that I think of it, Pieck probably somehow knows what is about to happen as well. I'm willing to bet the message she gave was a warning that they need to get away now.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It might also be that he has a better idea of who the "real enemy" is with all that he's learned, so now his anger is more targeted at a specific individual / group of individuals rather than at everyone that gets in his way.

He knows that we're expecting a blood bath, so the encounter will happen relatively calmly, with some people being taken away but no one getting killed on the spot. No one will turn into a titan either, it will be people talking and making threats but no actual fight breaking out. Maybe those thoughts are unfounded though.

To be able to go from spewing BS about how the wall people are descended from the "Devil", to actually siding with them and lying to his comrades that he grew up with and even helping the Survey Corps trap them, and all of this while maintaining a calm demeanor and not raising anyone's suspicions. I guess this is not that surprising, coming from a guy who as a kid blew his own parents' cover and turned them in to Marley, and who made everyone believe that he was "special" while knowing full well that in reality he's just a pure blooded Eldian. But still, you've got to be at least a little bit sociopath-like to be able to pull off all of that IMO.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Eren has forgiven Reiner for the past and doesn't see everyone beyond the ocean as an enemy anymore. Yet he still believes that he must move forward and wipe out the enemy. So to borrow Erwin's words, who do you think the real enemy is, Eren? Just what is he fighting for now? Assuming that he did manage to obtain the Warhammer titan just now, what does this change if the entire world unifies against the Eldians as a result? Last time this happened, Eldia won against the rest of the world, but at what cost? Entire societies were supposedly wiped out. Is Eren trying to just undo King Fritz's work and repeat history? Because if Eldia reclaims all of the titans and tramples the world, this does look like repeating history to me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have a few. My main one is that this statement came to Eren's mind from one the previous individuals who had the control of the Attack Titan and who was once in the same place (in Marley), through one of the "paths" that appear to transcend time. This titan is supposed to be "the one that always moves ahead", so a statement about advancing makes perfect sense for an owner of the Attack Titan to say.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If you've been reading the sub for a long time and you remember me, you may also remember how I used to believe that the different worlds in Shingeki no Kyojin were connected through some kind of "world tree", just like the nine worlds are connected through Yggdrasil in Norse mythology (which Isayama, at times, heavily draws upon for inspiration). But since then we've learned that the world in the story is much more like our own than we may have initially imagined, with large masses of land being separated by bodies of water and people travelling by boat. In light of that, I no longer believe that the world of SnK has different worlds connected by a magical tree. What I now believe symbolically represents Yggdrasil is the so-called "paths" that seem to connect all Eldians in a way that transcends physical notions of space and time. What if the indivudal consciousnesses of all Eldians are connected through some kind of world tree, with each main branch leading to one of the original nine titan's lineages, and then further branching out into all of their relatives? In other words, what if the "paths" are actually some kind of magical family tree of all of Eldia? When a titan holder dies and passes on his titan power, his consciousness is transferred to the new holder of said power. But what happens when a titan dies and does not pass on his power? I believe that his consciousness is then automatically sent back to the tree and fragmented into pieces that are sent to all the branches found along the way, starting with the branches that lead to the closest relatives and previous holders of the titan, and then to those that lead to more distant relatives, and so on, until all of the consciousness "fragments" have been passed to Eldians. And this happens independently of the notions of time and space, so the memories can be passed on to Eldians all over the world or even in times that represent some point in the past or the future. Now here's where I apply this theory to the current story. As we know, Eren has just a few years left to live. I believe that when he dies, he does not get eaten by another Eldian, but rather, he dies without passing on his many titan powers. The bad dream that he has at the very beginning of the story, at the start of the first chapter, are actually some of his own memories of a future past that he gets to re-live. And when he dies, Krueger, who previously had the Attack Titan, also receives memories that command him to protect his friends Mikasa and Armin. Furthermore, this idea that the Attack Titan "keeps moving forward" may have been invented by the original holder of this titan and passed on to every other holder of the titan ever since, just like the desire of King Fritz was passed on to every holder of the Founding Titan from the Reiss family afterwards. So in other words, Eldian memories of titan power holders are never lost: they are either passed on to the next holder of the power, or if the transfer doesn't happen, they are passed to other Eldians by order of how closely related they are to the person by blood. And the same thing happens with the titan power itself; we know that when some titan holder dies without passing on their power, some other seemingly random Eldian receives their power and memories instead. What do you guys think? Plausible or not? Let me know!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The only question that matters right now: has Zeke actually been with the Survey Corps all along like we suspect? Because Pieck and Porko look like they're about to head out to fight them, so if we've been wrong about Zeke, we might be in for one hell of a titan battle in the next chapter. If not, and we're right about Zeke having changed sides, then... I really don't know what's gonna happen. Will he try and convince Pieck and Porko to not go? I'm assuming he doesn't want them to die and believe the Survey Corps to be far more well organized, if he's really sided with them. Either way, should be interesting.</TEXT>

About the guy who has been making everyone believe that he's a "prodigy" while knowing full well himself that he's just an Eldian of royal blood. It's absolutely not surprising if he just coldly changed sides just like that and left his comrades to die.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As the title states, this is very much WIP. This started as a Baron build with Dead Reckoning Summon Skeleton and Iron Will, and turned into a mish mash of different new 3.1 items that's hard to describe. The idea is to constantly summon minions as Soul's Wick spectres, but to more often than not summon bone archers with Unearth linked to Spell Totem - Spell Echo - GMP. For the Raise Spectre setup, I use Minion Damage - Added Lightning Damage - Increase Critical Strike Chance - Iron Grip - GMP. I also added two The Poet's Pen that I proc with Kinetic Blast linked to GMP - CoH - Proj. Weakness. The Poet's Pens have Summon Skeletons - GMP - Iron Will and Animate Weapon - Melee splash - Bone Offering. Let me know what you all think!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>One thing that Eren must absolutely do before he leaves Marley is to tell the full story to Falco. Otherwise he's absolutely going to end up like Eren when he was young, that is, as a boy who lost people he cared about to the titans and who is hell bent on revenge. In other words, there's a chance that the cycle of hatred that has plagued their world will just perpetuate itself. Falco needs to see the truth about how complex the world actually is and what has been going on, so that he changes at a younger age than Eren did. What do you guys think?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think Zeke really did betray Marley. First of all, he showed up with no titans or objects to throw at them. Zeke's not a close-range fighter, that's why he usually relies on his strategy of killing most of them from faraway while he causes chaos at close range with his mindless titans. He didn't do any of that this time. Second of all, notice Pieck's facial expression? She isn't happy or relieved to see him. It's like she realized that Zeke is acting weirdly and that there is something fishy that is going on.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Here's what I think, to summarize. Zeke is betraying Marley and Pieck can tell, that's why she doesn't look happy to see him. The Survey Corps is setting up a trap in Liberio. They're waiting for all the 30,000 soldiers to come in, at which point Armin will drop from the sky as the Colossal Titan and kill all the Marleyans. Then Zeke will help Eren activate the Coordinate's power to neutralize the titans that are left after that. Also, these lights that they are turning on everywhere are precisely so that Armin can know where to jump, and Zeke showed up pretty much unarmed (wthout any projectiles to throw/mindless titans to use), with Levi not even looking at him, which means that he's not here to really fight and that Levi knows that he is now an undercover ally Finally, when Levi said survive, I'm pretty sure he really meant "Survive until Armin shows up."</TEXT>

He's willing to kill a bunch of innocent people, even children, just to put his own plan in motion. I want to ask him the same question that he wanted to ask Annie years ago... Eren, what greater purpose are *you* fighting for? Clearly his time on Marley has transformed him in some way, but I wonder what kind of world he wishes for now? He says that he will continue to move forward until the enemy is wiped out, but if he doesn't want to kill all titans anymore, then *who* is the enemy exactly?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Surely I'm not the only one who saw at the end how the girl somehow casually reattached her crystallized self to the titan and regained control of it that way and then proceeded to impale Eren's titan with an instantly materialized enormous tree-like structure of spikes. So you can disconnect the crystal from the titan but it can reconnect itself, and even if you do disconnect it for a while, there's no saying that you can actually break through that crystal and kill the human inside of it. And it can instantly materialize any kind of solid object and use it as a deadly weapon. I wonder if that material is powerful enough to break through Reiner's armour. Either way, this is bordeline overpowered IMO. This WH titan really is the real deal. No apparent weaknesses, and its actual fighting power is far greater than that of any other titan. Sure, it can't use fighting moves like Annie, but who needs to use a fighting move when you can just impale your enemy by making a spike come out of the ground?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I see your point but I don't think it's that simple. It can *reattach* itself. Even if you break the link, it can reform it and instantly neutralize you with a bunch of spikes. Just think for a second how powerful that is. The only reason Eren even got to the crystal to begin with was because it didn't expect him to figure it out. I would think that if the girl knows you're trying to get the crystal, she would be able to protect herself and it would be very difficult to even get to it to begin with. You would have to somehow be able to dodge spikes coming out of the ground and perhaps a super long and flexible hammer that can literally crush you, among other things. Honestly I think the Jaw titan and the Cart titan are detail compared to such a thing. The WH will be the real big battle if I have to make a prediction.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm predicting that the WH Titan will be the real final battle. Honestly, the titans of Zeke, Pieck and Porco are nothing compared to this monster. It looks to me like the SC are underestimating it and I'm not sure why. I don't think they realize just how ridiculously overpowered it is. Its human seemingly cannot be killed, as we have seen nothing to date that can break through this crystal *and* it can reattach itself to the titan somehow even if you disconnect it. It also shouldn't be affected even if Armin drops and makes a big explosion, as there's no evidence that the explosion would destroy the crystal, AND it can hide it underground anyway to shelter it from the blast.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm starting to wonder whether Zeke was ever really on Marley's side. Maybe Zeke has always just picked the side that was most beneficial for himself. After the battle on Paradi he must have realized that the Survey Corps had far more potential than any fighting force from Marley. So whenever he had the opportunity after that, he sided with his brother. From that point on it wasn't a difficult choice, I would think. I never personally thought that he believed any of this "children of the Devil" stuff, so I can see it, him changing sides and betraying Marley and all that. It's not too far-fetched to be true.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2018-02-08 13:27:01</DATE>
    <TEXT>The modpack has a lot of mods, but most of them are utility / UI improvement / graphics, sound and performance improvement mods. There's very few mods that actually add content (the goal is to keep it "vanilla-enhanced" only), but the main ones are Animalia, Bibliocraft and MrCray's Furniture Mod. For now the modpack is private. You can download it and view the modlist [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/vz8mvm68abpshnh/mods4.zip?dl=1). I've updated this list pretty much everyday to date since I've started working on it, so expect changes as well. You can view a screenshot of the world [here](https://i.imgur.com/BAYkL7C.png). The shaders used in this screenshot are Continuum Graphics 2.0. This map is a modified version of Astavie's [Skyblock 3](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/skyblock-3) map. The floating islands were made using schematics by user [OldNag](https://www.minecraft-schematics.com/user/oldnag/) on minecraft-schematics.com. PM me if you would like to know which ones exactly. It also has a bunch of custom recipes using the MineTweaker RecipeMaker mod, as well as [custom loot tables](https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/maps/2795915-nine-islands-skyblock-obtain-every-block-and-item) that were made for another Skyblock Survival map by TheDeviantCrafter (ign Ajrei on reddit). This project is currently a work in progress and I'm learning along the way, so let me know if there is any interest. I also have a small (4-5 people) hosted server that I use to test the modpack.</TEXT>

I will also remove Hwyla and try out TOP Addons; you're right that it's unecessary to have both TOP and Hwyla. Finally, Optifine being in there is mistake, and it's the reason why I stressed that this is a private modpack and that I'm still learning; Optifine shouldn't have been in the zip file and if I ever make this into an actual mod pack I will ensure that it's 100% legal and that I have received permission from all the mod makers beforehand!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Deleted and reposted because the link was broken in the original post. Sorry about that! Also a few more things I should add. The shader pack used is Continuum Graphics 2.0 and the resource packs used are Faithful 32x, Modded Faithful 32x 1.12.2, and Modded Faithful 32x 1.11.2. There's a few zones I haven't shown because they don't look good, like a basement with some chests and a nether portal. If anyone wants the modpack, tell me about it here and I could provide a Dropbox download link. However I add and remove new mods everyday just fyi so you might not get the exact same thing as what you see in those screenshots in terms of mod content.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Some cool mods for 1.12 that I haven't seen too many people use (in no particular order)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-02-11 14:40:08</DATE>
    <TEXT>[Soviet Abandoned Lab Mod](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/soviet-abandoned-lab-mod-1-12-2). A purely cosmetic Russian mod that adds Soviet era-style decoration blocks based on the game 'STALKER'. The blocks are really well made and can be used for a wide range of decorative purposes, not just the one they're intended for. [Stupid Things](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/stupid-things). Despite the name, this mod adds a bunch of random items and blocks that are not stupid at all. Most of them are quite useful and unique, like a water balloon that actually drops water when it explodes, googles that allow you to see the world upside down, and an anvil backpack that allows you to deal damage to mobs by jumping on them Super Mario-style. [Better Placement](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/better-placement). A small mod that makes a huge difference in gameplay. It has been game-changing for me. What it does is it improves the vanilla block placement logic, preventing the game from trying to make you place a block every 4 ticks, which in turn prevents annoying results like double placed blocks or block gaps. Instead, blocks are placed instantly whenever the cursor is looking at a new block. If you don't think this makes a significant difference, try it and see for yourself. [Carry On](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/carry-on). Another small mod that makes a huge difference. It allows you to pick up and carry any tile entity or mob by using Shift + Right-Click while your hand is empty. I've found this especially useful for moving chests that have gotten in the way of building or moving around passive animals and villagers in Survival. [Additional Ender Blocks](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/additional-ender-blocks). Another purely cosmetic mod that adds new building blocks to The End. I find that the textures are really well made and can be used for a wide range of decorative purposes, not just End-themed buildings. [Amidst for Forge](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/amidst-for-forge). If you're a big AMIDST user like me, this mod will really make your life easier. It integrates all of your Minecraft folder's mods into the AMIDST application, and also allows you to launch AMIDST by simply entering the command /amidst in game. Furthermore, it not only adds modded biomes, but also modded world generation that gets added to already-existing biomes by mods such as GeographiCraft. [Primitive Mobs](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/primitive-mobs). This is my favorite mob mod, because none of the mobs feel "over the top", all of them retain a vanilla feel, and a lot of them have a unique look and some interesting mechanics. It just feels like a really well made mod overall. [Combustive Fishing](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/combustive-fishing). A pretty neat mod that adds some content to fishing without attempting to completely overhaul the fishing system like some other mods do. It just adds lava-fishing so you can also fish in the Nether. There's a special fishing rod and a few new fish. I like that it retains a very vanilla-ish feel and that nothing is over the top. [Extended Item Information](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/extended-item-information). A purely utility-focused mod that adds many item properties that you normally can't see in game, like the maximum durability of items, the items involved in making specific potions, the repair cost of enchanted items, the slipperiness, explosion resistance and harvest level of blocks, etc. There's much more than that and it's just overall very useful. [Torch Arrows](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/torch-arrows). Simple mod that does exactly what it says: it adds arrows that will place a torch at the location where they land. They can be crafted with coal, stick and feather. Quite cheap and adds some usefulness to chickens. Really nice for Survival, especially in the early game. edit: fixed a bunch of spelling errors.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'd like to know which ones you find game-breaking, because they all seem pretty vanilla-friendly to me. Carry On is the only one I can think of, because carrying mobs around completely defeats the purpose of leashing passive animals and using rails and minecarts to move villagers, but that's it I think.</TEXT>

I still think Carry On is nice if balance is not something you're concerned it, but Chest Transporter is definitely more aligned with what I'm looking for.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Vanilla hostile mob natural spawning has stopped completely in my single player survival world. Can't figure out why.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-02-12 02:56:55</DATE>
    <TEXT>I have a mod that adds mobs, Primitive Mobs, and for some reason the mobs from that mod are still spawning normally. Vanilla hostile mobs will also still spawn from a creative spawn egg and a monster spawner. Passive mobs also still spawn naturally, both those from vanilla and from mods (Animalia to be specific). But vanilla hostile mobs (zombies, skeletons, creepers) no longer spawn naturally in the world. Does anyone have any idea why? If it comes to it, I will start with a new Minecraft folder and add every single mod in my modpack one by one until I figure out which one caused that, but if someone has another way to figure it out, it would be awesome.</TEXT>

Covered in a second layer of skin, can instantly materialize seemingly any kind of object, the user is protected by a crystal that no other titan can chew through. This is possibly the strongest of all titans in terms of actual fighting power, although that's arguable. Literally its only clear weakness is that it has to pick up its own crystallized user in order to move across a longer distance but that's a weakness that can be covered by its other abilities.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2018-03-06 20:57:59</DATE>
    <TEXT>The Tybur family, and more specifically, Willy Tybur. In my view they really made this entire story. Let me explain why. For a very long time Marley believed that the Eldian King was a threat, and that's why they wanted to invade Paradi and also why they mistreated the Eldians living in Marley: because they were essentially seeing them as their enemy. But Willy knew from his sister that this was a lie, that all the King wanted was peace and that this is why he had brought the Eldians to an isolated island, and that he had no intention of getting his titans to "flatten the world". And yet, he never told anyone until very recently. You saw how surprised all of the high-ranking Marleyans were when he said the King had never wanted war, you could tell they had just learned something new. They were even wondering why he would tell them this now of all times. And they were right to wonder. Because if they had known this earlier, maybe they would have stopped oppressing the Eldians years ago, and then maybe the whole "Grisha going to Paradi to take the Progenitor Titan" thing would have never happened either. They probably would have still wanted to invade Paradi for its natural resources eventually, sure, but if Grisha never happens, Eren never happens and the Survey Corps attacking Marley probably never happens either. So when Willy says in his speech that the King just wanted peace and that Eren Yeager is the real enemy that must be stopped, I find that funny because his inaction is basically what "made" Eren. He could have spoken up against oppressing the other Eldians and against invading Paradi, knowing that they were not a threat, but he never did. And the rest is history. I'm not defending Marley at all, but if they had known the truth, there's a good chance that they would have acted differently. So in the end almost all of this is the Tybur family's fault.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I just realized from seeing the WHT again that there's a slight chance that Annie has been conscious while stuck inside of her own crystal for all these years. That sounds like a fate worse than death, honestly. If she really was conscious, I hope for her that they managed to get her out of the crystal and had someone from the SC eat her or something. At least that would have put an end to her mental suffering from being stuck alive in a crystal. I wonder if we'll learn anything else about her in this chapter, or if it'll just be Eren bringing up her crystal and that's it.</TEXT>

Also I'm pretty sure Levi didn't kill him, when he easily could have. I think you've almost convinced me that he's really on their side! edit: after further thinking, no it still seems too far-fetched, I don't think Levi would put this many soldiers' lives at risk for this like someone else pointed out. Maybe they do have something else planned for Zeke (like kidnapping him), which would explain why Levi didn't make sure that he was really dead, but I highly, highly doubt that Zeke is on their side.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Damn it Isayama. I really don't know what to think anymore. Is Zeke on Paradi's side or not? Initially I thought yes, because of the baseball stuff and other hints, but then after reading the chapter I initially thought there's no way, Zeke just got sliced and then blown up by Levi, and also Levi would never put all these soldiers' lives at risk for such a masquerade. But then someone else pointed out that Zeke seems to be in on the whole 'time' thing that the SC seems to have been planning... Zeke yells 'Levi, time is running out' and then Levi looks at his watch and shortly after jumps on him out of nowhere and cuts his nape with his sword. Now I don't know what to think anymore. I'll say this, if Zeke is not on Paradi's side, then Isayama has gone really far to troll us with this one. Almost every chapter since the Marley arc started, there's been some subtle clues that arguably suggest Zeke being a double-agent. So if turns out to be all BS and Zeke just gets killed by the SC, I think I'll be a little disappointed at this point.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm obviously talking about Zeke here. Since there's now a lot of community support behind the theory that he's a double agent, I've been thinking about what might have caused him to change sides. I think one big reason is simply Eren. We don't know if Eren convinced him to side with him or if he just wanted to be on the same side as his half-brother or if it's some other completely different scenario, but either way discovering the existence of Eren played a big part in why he changed sides. The second reason is, and this is very speculative, but he realized that people within the walls were not just 'fools' controlled by the Eldian king. One thing I recall about Zeke is that he used to despise the people within the walls for being ignorant fools who were controlled by the royalty in place there and who just kept getting their memories erased over and over again. When he found out that the Survey Corps had taken the founding titan from the king, gotten rid of the nobles and that they were now trying to rebuild their society around a more fair power hierarchy, it's possible that his opinion of them completely changed. Maybe he even started thinking that they were, in fact, smarter and more skilled than their Marleyan counterparts, and he saw working with them as an opportunity to defeat the Tyburs, who had been oppressing his own people for years through their control of the Marleyan government. It's also possible that Zeke has known (or suspected) for a very long time that the Marleyan government was just a pawn of the Tyburs, and he came to secretly despise them because of that. This, combined with a desire to side with his half-brother and with the realization that the Eldians within the walls are not really the ignorant fools he once thought they were, might have been enough to make him change sides. It's just quick thoughts that I wanted to share with you all and there's still a chance that he's not a double agent after all and that Isayama has been trolling us all along. So please take everything I just wrote with a grain of salt, but I'd love to have a discussion about this.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I forgot to mention that, but I theorized that he eventually started communicating with Eren, and even possibly met with him at some point while the latter was infiltrating Marley, and that it's how he received all this information about life within the walls: because Eren told him.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm having mixed feelings about this chapter. On one hand, I'm disappointed that the death of the WHT was so anti-climatic, but on the other, the way Eren killed her was really cool and unexpected. Also, I'm disappointed that we didn't see Zeke at all, but at the same time his 'death' in the last chapter looked suspiciously staged and his sudden disappearance makes me believe that he wanted to go into hiding and therefore that his storyline is far from over, which I'm excited about. Overall, feeling mixed about this chapter but I still enjoyed it as always. Isayama is a genius.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I just realized that Eren talking to Reiner to get him into an unstable state of mind was probably intentional. He knew that coming face to face with him would destabilize him emotionally and he wanted him to be a non-factor during the battle. Same reason why Pieck and Porco were supposed to sit in a hole. Eren has become one evil genius.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Like everything, it's a combination of many factors, including genetic makeup, physical exercise regimen, and diet. If you do resistance training exercises regularly and eat sufficiently, you will surely grow your own lower body muscles over time. But because of genetic variations amongst individuals, even if you exercise and eat just like her, you are unlikely to ever achieve the same results as her, i.e., your butt, quadriceps muscles and hamstrings will still never look exactly like hers. That shouldn't deter you from wanting to improve yourself, though. But don't compare yourself to someone else, that won't take you anywhere.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Build concept idea: Trap-Based Minion Army Summoner</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-05-17 22:34:31</DATE>
    <TEXT>First, here's the [PoE pastebin link](https://pastebin.com/FF6TcKJ8) with the lvl 100 skill tree, items, and skill gem setups, for those who don't want to read anything and would rather just look at the build right away. Note that my character is only lvl 77 right now so the skill gems are not lvl 20 / 21 yet. **The idea** With the Cheap Construction unique jewel, the Sunblast unique belt and the Cluster Traps Support skill gem, you can spawn a lot of mobs really quickly. On this character I'm using 10 Cheap Construction jewels, but you could probably use more. **Skill gem setup** - Blink Arrow in a 6L with Pierce, Minion Damage, Elemental Damage with Attacks, Cluster Traps and Trap. - Summon Raging Spirits in a 6L with Minion Damage, Melee Splash, Elemental Damage with Attacks, Cluster Traps and Trap. - Mirrow Arrow in a pseudo 6L with Elemental Damage with Attacks, Cluster Traps, Pierce, and lvl 18 Slower Projectiles and lvl 18 Trap. - Summon Skeleton in a pseudo 5L with Elemental Damage with Attacks, Multiple Traps, Trap and level 16 Minion Damage. - A 4L with Anger, Wrath, Vaal Haste and Generosity. - Flesh Offering and lvl 1 Clarity each in an Unset Ring socket slot. Note: with Summon Skeleton, I'm using Multiple Traps instead of Cluster Traps, because the former is enough to summon all the skeletons at once with the Bone Sculptor Ascendency skill. **Pros** - Lots of fun to play, especially if you like to summon a crapload of minions. - All monster disappear pretty much instantly, including Map bosses and red Beasts. **Cons** - Keybind-intensive build, this is not a build you can play with the mousepad only while watching Netflix on another screen. - Relatively cheap to make, but it will suck to play unless you use a lot of currency to improve the build's quality of life (more info about this below). - Very squishy, definitely not hardcore-viable, you will have about 5k5 EHP at lvl 99. - If you're playing on a crappy computer, this build is probably too laggy for you to play. **Suggested items** - Lioneye's Glare: really good bow for your Blink Arrow and Minion Arrow minions to use, but a good rare bow would potentially be better. - Bone Helmet: I'm using a Bone Helmet with Minion Damage Support to make this build even more damage-y, but you could use any rare helmet or even some unique helmets. - Tinkerskin: This body armour will really improve the build's quality of life thanks to Phasing, the sustain and the increased cooldown recovery speed for throwing traps. But you could use a Tabula Rasa or a lot of other different body armours and the build would still work. - Sunblast: As previously mentioned, this item is the most important for the build and arguably the only mandatory one. Combined with Cheap Construction jewels, it makes your traps detonate instantly and allows you to spawn minions very quickly without having to throw your traps on monsters specifically. - Rings: You could use anything here, I'm using two Unset Rings for extra gem socket slots. - Amulet: You could use anything here as well, I'm using a high-strength, high-dexterity Onyx Amulet to meet skill gem requirements. - Gloves: I'm using a pseudo 6L here, but what is the most important thing to get here is the explicit global mod "Skills which Throw Traps throw an additional Trap." Like Tinkerskin, this will also drastically improve the build's quality of life. - Boots: You could use anything here as well, I'm using rare boots with the explicit mod "X% increased Cooldown Recovery Speed" to further improve the build's quality of life. - Quiver: You could use anything here as well, I'm using a Drillneck with the implicit Vaal mod "Bow Attacks fire an additional Arrow". This also improves the build's quality of life but is quite expensive and / or difficult to find. On the other hand, a regular Drillneck is very affordable and still suits the build nicely, since it uses Pierce for both Blink Arrow and Mirrow Arrow. **Ascendency** The three most important Ascendency skills are Puppet Master, Invoker and Commander of Darkness. Puppet Master and Invoker are both straight up boosts to our minions, while Commander of Darkness is also a boost to your character as well, thanks to the fact that we run lvl 1 Clarity. This is important, since getting capped elemental resistances is difficult with this build, due to the fact that it uses a lot of unique items. As the final Ascendency skill, I'm using Bone Sculptor, but if you don't wish to use Skeletons, you can take Mistress of Sacrifice, which is also a really good option. **Final comments** There are a lot of ways you could tweak this build. It might even be possible to make it HC viable, although I haven't tried that myself. This is just my take on the concept of Trap-based Summoner, and hopefully it inspires some of you who will read this to try your own variation of the build concept. Thanks for reading if you've made it this far! Edit: fixed some spelling mistakes.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You're right. I actually removed the Skeletons and changed the 4L in my Bone Helmet for Raise Zombie and Vaal Summon Skeletons with Minion Speed and Elemental Damage with Attacks. I also removed Bone Scupltor and took Mistress of Sacrifice instead. It's much better, the SRS last longer and I never had enough time to use the skeletons anyway, like you pointed out.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>[Pastebin of the skilltree](https://pastebin.com/jVNKLLzy). The skill tree is pretty straightforward: almost all the minion nodes, 208% Inc Life, curse nodes, and some elem resist nodes. Two goals: 1. Using Dark Pact, Vaal Summon Skeletons and Minion Instability as primary sources of damage. 2. Relying on no particular unique items (duh, obviously, since it's SSF) Skill gems: - Vaal Summon Skeletons, Minion Damage, Minion Life, Minion Speed, Elemental Focus, Concentrated Effect - Dark Pact, Spell Echo, Controlled Destruction, Void Manipulation, Added Chaos Damage, Increased Aoe/Conc Effect - Blasphemy, Temp Chains, Enfeeble/Elem Weakness (haven't decided yet), lvl17 Vaal Clarity - Raise Zombie, Summon Chaos Golem, Animate Guardian, Minion Life - Flesh Offering/Bone Offering, Desecrate, Vaal Haste, Convocation OR a CWDT setup with Offering, Desecrate, Immortal Call and Phase Run, haven't decided yet - Could put Vaal Haste and Vaal Clarity in Unset Rings if I find good ones. Then I would modify the 4l setups in some ways. Some items that would be nice to find: - Femurs of the Saints for Vaal Summon Skeletons - Bloodbond - Earendel's Embrace (for Vaal Summon Skeletons, in which case I would switch to EE and probably run an Orb of Storms setup to trigger it, and also use Temp Chains and Flammability as curses) or The Scourge (for Dark Pact) - A pseudo-6l Elder/Shaped Bone Helmet That's it!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Just wanted to show my appreciation to GGG for revamping Dominating Blow. I tried to make this skill work for a very long time, but never got quite the result I was hoping for. I only play the Necromancy ascendency in the SSF HC league, which is a very small niche, so I am extremely thankful that GGG added a new toy that happens to fit the way I personally enjoy playing the game. Thank you GGG! Already bought my supporter pack. :)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[Manga Spoilers]A theory on Asta, Licht and demons</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-08-12 02:43:37</DATE>
    <TEXT>We know that Licht created various anti-magic weapons. We also know that the demon within the sword (or within the grimoire) of Asta seems to be anti-magic as well, as when Asta enters his "black form", he seems to channel some of the demon's lifeform out of the sword and onto his own body, which makes said body become anti-magic as well. Since both Licht's weapons and the demon appear to be anti-magic, is it possible that Licht and the Elf tribe also created demons, using some kind of forbidden magic and an enormous amount of magic power? If the demon is also a creation of the Elves, after Licht "died" (he didn't physically die but became incapacitated for centuries), it's possible that the demon was able to get into Licht's grimoire and modify it to suit his own purposes (this could be why the grimoire's clover now has five leaves instead of four, because the fifth leaf represents the demon). As we know, one of the demon's goals was to re-gain access to the physical world. So the second step of his plan was to find a host body that would be able to use Licht's grimoire and that he would be able to possess. But that required someone with an enormous amount of magic power that no human has and all the Elves were dead. At some point he must have come across Asta and figured out that someone with no magic would also work, as the weapons and demon himself cannot suck magic out of someone who doesn't have any. Just a theory that I came up with. In short, the demon needed someone with the magic reserve of a powerful Elf, as both the demon and the anti-magic weapons suck magic out of their user, but he discovered a magic loophole and figured out that someone with no magic would also work, hence why he came to possess Asta and to give him the modified grimoire that had previously belonged to Licht.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As a Summoner main, I'm scratching my head right now trying to figure out how viable Herald of Agony will be for the Necromancer Ascendency. I'm also wondering how good the minion will be as a standalone skill gem. I could easily see some Poet's Pen Necro build having an easy time applying the poison stacks on mobs, so that's not really the issue. But the question is whether or not the Mana Reservation will be worth it. And also whether or not it will be good on its own without any support gems. Cause I don't really see myself running this in a 4l in too many builds, unless it's so insanely good that it's worth using as a main skill even for Necromancer, in which case I'd run it as a 5l or 6l anyway.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Wizard King? How about Demon King instead?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-08-26 23:15:41</DATE>
    <TEXT>Ok, I just had this crazy idea. What if Asta actually shares his body with the demon that we've seen, in the same way that Patri and William are two souls that share the same body? And that demon is not just any demon, but the most powerful of them all, hence why he would worthy of the unofficial title of "Demon King". At some point, this demon will completely overtake the body and he and Asta share, similarly to how Patri has completely overtaken the body he shares with William following the completion of the reincarnation spell. And Yuno will be the one to defeat the most powerful demon (Asta) and become the Wizard King, just like the wizard who defeated a powerful demon and became the first Wizard King, like we always see in the intro. And in the end Asta will regain control of his body and become the leader of the other demons. Regarding the demon's motives, I think he took Licht's grimoire and mana for himself because he needed to be inside of a grimoire in order to gain control of a being in the physical world, that being being Asta. This might have been possible because Licht was completely incapacitated and yet not dead. He never died (because otherwise his grimoire would have disintegrated), but because he used such powerful forbidden magic, he wasn't really alive anymore either; in other words he got trapped in some kind of magic loophole and the demon used this loophole to his advantage. What do you guys think? I know this would be a twist to the common shonen trope, as Asta is supposed to be the main protagonist, and Yuno and Noelle are supposed to be the secondary protagonists that serve as catalyst for Asta's character growth, but I don't think my theory is that far-fetched.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Don't get me wrong, every league basically being a mini-expansion now is awesome. I'm loving all this new content and it's even more awesome knowing that it's probably going to get added to the core game too at some point down the road. But the reason why I'm scared is because GGG keeps raising the bar higher and higher in terms of new content releases. I feel like when they do actually announce a new expansion, which they will as they have stated their intention to release PoE 4.0 in 2019, it will be incredibly hard to meet people's expectations. We have been spoiled by all this new content every league, and it makes me wonder what the future of PoE looks like. I would personally prefer that GGG work on improving/reworking the older stuff, but with all this new content that they're pumping out, it feels like they have no intention of stopping to focus on the new rather than the old, even if they are also doing some reworking here and there. What do you guys think? Am I the only one who's scared that GGG is trying too hard to produce new content too quickly?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Since Minion builds are going to be trendy in Delve, here's some tips about Minions in general that you may not know, from someone who exclusively plays Minion builds.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-08-29 01:38:42</DATE>
    <TEXT>This is for people who don't know anything about Minions. If you are knowledgeable about the game in general, you probably already know all of these. - Skill gem level provides by far the biggest overall stat boost to Minions. And the stat boost becomes greater the higher you go in levels, meaning for example that going from lvl 20 to 21 will provide a far bigger boost than going from lvl 10 to 11. Animate Weapon in particular is notable for scaling massively with skill gem levels. Skill gems like Raise Zombie and Animate Guardian absolutely need to be at least lvl 21 if you want them to survive Red map bosses. On the other hand, the exception to this rule is Raise Spectre, since minions that you raise as Spectres scale with monster level and not much with skill gem level. - With the exception of Support skill gems, Minion Damage is the only stat that actually increases the damage of your Minions. So, for example, Melee Physical Damage Support will increase the melee physical damage of your Minions, but increases in melee physical damage on items will not. It is also the biggest damage multiplier for Minions (skill gem levels will give the biggest overall boost but not the biggest damage boost). All other damage stat will have no effect, including "Damage" and "global damage". - Other stats that affect Minions include "x to y Minion damage to attacks", "% Minion damage", "%Minion movement speed", etc., generally any stat that has "Minion" in it somewhere will affect Minions. - Minions count as allies but not as party members. However, the Minions of your party members do count as allies as well. Effects that provide buffs to allies, such as war cries, will therefore work with Minions. On the other hand, the keystone Conduit, which shares charges with nearby party members, will not share charges with Minions. - On melee Minions, accuracy is the second biggest damage multiplier after Minion Damage Support. The easiest way to get Minion accuracy is either through the new Minion accuracy nodes that will be in the skill tree in 3.4, or with Additional Accuracy Support. Summon Skeleton doesn't need extra accuracy thanks to the "Bone Sculptor" Ascendency. If you run the keystone Necromantic Aegis with Lycosidae, you also do not need to care about accuracy either. - Starting with red maps, you need to run Bone Offering if you want your Minions to survive in most cases. Otherwise they may die to bosses, Abyss monsters or certain Unique and Rare mobs. This may not be true if you have stacked a lot of % Minion life. Also, I would like to point out that this is based on my personal experience only, and some people are saying in the comments that Bone Offering is not necessary at all, and rather, that it's better to run Flesh Offering to kill monsters faster and get more % damage leeched as life from doing more damage. This is a good argument and I would agree with it. - With the "Soul Weaver" Ascendency and enough % Minion life, your high level Spectres can run maps with damage reflection mods without dying. Using Convocation for the health regen and to get your Minions out of harm's way will also help greatly. - When it comes to Minion defensive stats, after a certain point % life regen and % damage leeched as life will help your Minions survive more than % Minion life. This is because Minions have really high base HP, especially at higher levels. A great way to boost your Minion's survivability, as mentioned by u/Tsevion, is to run a Sulphur flask. The consecrated ground will heal a percentage of your Minions' life every second, which, for the reason mentioned above, will boost their survivability a lot. - Faster Attacks Support on melee Minions is a noob trap. If you want to clear faster, use Minion Speed Support and for boss killing, even this is not needed at all. An exception to this rule is when you are using melee Summon Skeleton in a Femurs of the Saints, in that case Minion Speed Supports get +2 levels which makes it worth using. - When it comes to Ghastly Eye jewels, flat minion damage is also generally a noob trap. You need to invest heavily in elemental damage in order to make it good, otherwise % minion damage is always going to be better. For these jewels, what you are actually looking for the most is "Minions have % chance to blind on hit" and "Minions have % chance to taunt on hit". These two jewel modifiers will greatly improve your own survival. - Due to a bug that GGG currently can't be bothered fixing, your Animate Guardian can benefit from both The Bringer of Rain and a chest armour. This is a small thing, but it's pretty nice if you're playing a Chains of Command build. - If you run a Baron build with Summon Skeleton and the Dead Reckoning Unique jewel, your Skeletons will actually benefit from Iron Will support. This wasn't the case before but GGG changed this in 3.1. Based on my recent calculations through PoB, you need about 700 Strength to get the same DPS as a regular non-Baron setup. Iron Will Support also seems to work with golems but it's unclear whether it works with all Spectre Minions or not. More testing needed. - Since 3.1, Dark Pact counts as a Minion skill gem. This means that if you put Dark Pact in Cloak of Tawm'r Isley, which has the Unique modifier "Socketed Minion Gems are Supported by Level 16 Life Leech", it will be affected by the life leech and you will get healed from using Dark Pact. As a side note, Cloak of Tawm'r Isley is also a damage boost for Animate Weapon, as it allows you to use Magic weapons which have a higher base damage than Normal ones. - Monsters killed by your Minions will not count as your kills, meaning that on-kill effects, such as getting a charge on kill, will not work on you. However, Minion kills will give you flask charges and also be affected by your %IQ and %IR stats. Effects from Unique items such as Headhunter and The Gull will also benefit you from your Minion kills. - As pointed out by u/happymeal79, charges affect Minions differently than players, in fact they affect them the same way as monsters. You can see the [wiki](https://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/Charge#Effects_on_Monsters_and_Minions) for the details, but basically this means that charges are more powerful with little investment on Minions than on players. This is why a Victario's Charity + Necromantic Aegis setup is really good. That's it for now. If I remember more tips I will edit this post. Edit: a lot of people in the comments have provided great advice that is sometimes more detailed and more useful than what I have provided myself in my OP. So if you read this post you should definitely scroll through the comments as well.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is true but that's why I said "generally". It's also probably possible to make flat elemental damage good by investing heavily in an elemental damage setup with high level auras, Elemental Damage with Attacks Support, and items like Grip of the Council. But in a lot of cases where you are limited in what you can do, % Minion damage is the better option.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I actually only play SSFHC myself, but this isn't really a SSF HC Summoner thread, that's why I didn't say anything about SSF specifically. If you are playing a melee Minion setup I highly recommend running a 4l setup with Hatred - Generosity Support - Temporal Chains - Blasphemy. You have to get fairly close to enemies to cast Summon Skeleton, so Temporal Chains will help make it a lot safer, especially if you also run the keystone Hex Master in the skill tree. And Hatred is a massive damage boost for melee Minions even if you don't invest in elemental damage and aura effects. For which items to get early, I would start by saying that Tabula Rasa is not as necessary as some people believe because as a Summoner you can get by just fine with a 5L. In HC I prefer a Rare 5l with a lot of HP to a Tabula Rasa. The easiest and most useful Unique items to get, well, there's a few. Mon'tregul's Grasp can be farmed easily with the divination card "Death" which drops in Marshes and Flooded Mine. This is probably going to be the biggest single boost to the damage and surviability of your Zombies. Queen's Decree is a common random drop but getting the prophecy to upgrade it is very unlikely. Bones of Ullr is also a common random drop but now that you can get +1 Spectre on rare boots, it's not as mandatory anymore. Femurs of the Saints is also relatively common and is a solid choice for a melee Skeleton build. Victario's Charity is also a relatively common drop and this + Necromantic Aegis and Mon'tregul's Grasp is probably the go-to choice for HC map farming. Belt of the Deceiver is BiS IMO because of the reduced extra damage from critical strikes. It's your go-to choice until you can find a good rare Abyss belt with a good Abyss jewel. Baron is not that hard to find, and neither are the other Unique items that you need to make a Baron build (Meginord's Vise, Alberon's Warpath, etc), but the biggest issue is finding the Unique jewels, Brawn and Efficient Training. These are hard to find in SSF and unless you find them I wouldn't make a Baron build. Finally, personally I don't like to rely on chancing items. Early in the league I actually prefer to use my Orbs of Chance to buy maps from Zana. Later in the league though you can always try to chance items, I would probably try to chance a Vis Mortis as it's not a common Unique to find randomly and it's a big damage boost.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's just a personal choice. I'm not saying that Tabula is not a solid choice, it is. I just find that lately my RNG is good enough that I get a 5L early on most of the time, and I feel that I can get by with that while enjoying the extra defensive stats that a Rare chest armour provides. A Tabula is also fine though.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's very hard to say what will be good for the HoA Minion. My tips are based on my personal experience and knowledge of the currently existing minions. But they might not apply at all to new Minions, so I'd be patient and just wait till people get more on-hands experience and info on them.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Since some people asked, here's a quick Necromancer Summoner starter guide for 3.4. Made for SSFHC, no Unique items required.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-08-29 23:21:43</DATE>
    <TEXT>As requested, here's the league starter that I will be using in Delve SSFHC. [Link to the skill tree pastebin](https://pastebin.com/whENg8KD). This is the final skill tree, made while keeping in mind that you might want to temporarily get Elemental resistances, Dexterity and Strength along the way until you find better gear: - You can get Elemental resistances with Faith and Steel, Holy Dominion and Sentinel. - There are only two jewel slots for Violent Dead x2, but you can get more jewel sockets if you do find some good Rare jewels. - You can get more Dexterity and Strength with Agility and Might, Alacrity and Physique, Precision and Practical Application. - You also get more Mana and Mana Regeneration with Deep Thoughts and Arcane Will. **Skill gem setup**: - 6L: Vaal Summon Skeleton, Minion Damage, Melee Splash, Minion Speed, Multistrike, Melee Physical Damage. - 4L: Raise Zombie, Minion Damage, Multistrike, Melee Physical Damage (you can use Melee Splash till you find Mon'tregul's Grasp). - 4L: Dark Pact, Curse on Hit, Temporal Chains, Enfeeble. - 4L: Flesh Offering, Convocation, Summon Chaos Golem, Animate Guardian - 3L: Shield Charge, Fortify, Faster Attacks - 3L: Hatred, Generosity, Vaal Haste/Vaal Lightning Trap/Vaal Immortal Call **Some skill gem choices explained:** - With Vaal Summon Skeletons, Dark Pact makes it easy to apply curses on enemies. Dark Pact also deals high base damage so if you spam it on bosses it will be noticeable, especially as your Skeletons get more % Life from the skill tree. - Temporal Chains and Enfeeble are really good defensively, especially for this build since you get relatively close to monsters to cast Summon Skeleton. - Hatred is a really good aura for melee Minions even with little investment in Elemental damage and aura effects. - That's all I can think of for now, might add more here later. **Quick leveling guide**: - Use Freezing Pulse until you get to The Lower Prison. - Use Summon Raging Spirits from The Lower Prison to lvl 55, when you can do Cruel Lab. - Use Vaal Summon Skeleton from lvl 55 until the end. - I like to get all the offensive Minion nodes in the skill tree until act 5, at which point I get the MoM nodes, and then I start getting % Life and Elemental resistances and also working towards Whispers of Doom. - I like to do the Library in act 3 to get Temporal Chains and start leveling it as early as possible. - The skill points to the right of Deep Wisdom should be obtained last. The defensive Minion skill points should also be obtained at the very end when you've gotten everytihng else. - For the Ascendency, I get Bone Sculptor as soon as possible and then Flesh Binder and Mistress of Sacrifice last, but you could make the argument that getting Mistress of Sacrifice before Flesh Binder is better. **Some itemization tips for mapping** - You can farm Blood Aqueduct for Tabula Rasa but you can also be fine with a 5L rare chest armour. - Early on it's good to farm Marshes and Flooded Mine to get the divination card Death for Mon'tregul's Grasp. - If you find a Doedre's Damning you can forgo Whispers of Doom completely and get more defensive stats instead. **Other comments:** See my other post on Minions in general [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/9b41sx/since_minion_builds_are_going_to_be_trendy_in/). It's from yesterday and in the comments section you will find a lot of excellent advice from other people. Don't just read my original post you'll be missing out on a lot of info if you do that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>[Pastebin link](https://pastebin.com/a50e1yEt).

    <DATE>2018-08-30 03:29:04</DATE>
    <TEXT>[Pastebin link](https://pastebin.com/2Q7QacYA). **The main idea:** - Get a massive amount of ES and Armour using Memory Vault, Chaber Cairn and 4 Healthy Mind jewels. - Reserve mana with Hatred (linked to Generosity) and Discipline. - Increase Minion damage by scaling Elemental damage with Hatred and Grip of the Council. - Use Shavronne's Wrappings to disregard HP. **Experimental skill gem setup:** - Chaber Cairn 6L: Dominating Blow, Minion Damage, Melee Splash, Melee Physical Damage, Multistrike, Minion Speed. - Shavronne's 6L: Herald of Purity, Raise Spectre, Vaal Summon Skeletons, Minion Damage, Minion Speed, Elemental Damage with Attacks. - 4L: Generosity, Vaal Haste, Hatred, and Vaal Discipline not linked. - 4L: Raise Zombie, Summon Chaos Golem/Summon Stone Golem, Animate Guardian, Summon Holy Relic. - 4L: Flesh Offering, Desecrate/Faster Casting, Convocation/Vaal Lightning Trap/Vaal Immortal Call, Flame Dash. **Items that are either required or useful:** - Memory Vault - Chaber Cairn - Shavronne's Wrappings - Atziri's Foible - Healthy Mind x4 - Kiara's Determination Let me know what you guys think!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Personally I'm not even asking for that much. Getting all the base stats and stat scaling would be downright AMAZING but what I would like to know at the very least is: - How well do they scale with skill gem levels? Right now, almost all Minions skill gems minus Raise Spectre scale really well with skill gem levels. But what about those new Minion gems? What does their level scaling look like? - What is their base speed? This alone could decide whether they're viable for map-clearing or not. No one wants slow-as-fuck Minions that can't even be made efficient with Minion Speed because their base speed is garbage. - What is their base HP? This will let us know whether or not their life could be scaled with Minion % Life from the skill tree to make a build with Minion Instability. If GGG tells us those three things I'll be happy.</TEXT>
