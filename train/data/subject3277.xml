    <TEXT>I felt a wave of force go over me at night. It started at the edge of the bed and I thought it was my sister getting into bed, until I remembered I haven't been sharing a bed with her for years. As soon as I had that thought, this force just starts moving across the bed and pushing down so hard I thought it was going to break. Then it goes over me and I couldn't move or breathe as it pushed down on me and it did that twice. Probably sleep paralysis tho.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I went to a water park yesterday, and a little kid, (around 4 years old) started crying when he was about to go down a slide with his dad because he got scared. And as they're passing us going back down the stairs the dad says "come on, let's go you little baby girl" as this kid is sobbing :( it broke my heart. He's just a child you don't need to put him down for crying.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Idk if this is just me but floating down a river with friends on rafts. Every time people get shit faced to the point of passing out and we're babysitting them while trying to survive ourselves. We float for way too long. This one time ended up being 6 hours. There's alcohol but no water so we're all drunk, dehydrated and hungry. It's always miserable but I end up going every summer. Edit: to clarify we don't go floating without water or snacks. They'll grab some water but there's usually never enough by the time we're a couple hours in. I would prefer to float for 2 hours max, but I go with a big group and they decide where to start/end so I just go with it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Totally agree! Also, even if you feel like a worthless piece of shit, keep reminding yourself, no matter how hard it is, that you're not. Try standing in front of a mirror and say to yourself "I am awesome. I am NOT a piece of shit." Eventually you'll start believing it :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think your happiness and self-worth relied too much on her. Get into some hobbies, or spend time with friends to get your mind off of her. Just realize she's a person, just like everybody else, and there are so many other women out there. You can't tie yourself up to one person and just expect them to bring you happiness. You can love someone, but you need to love yourself. Don't feel like you're nothing without her and life is nothing without her. You have so much ahead of you and life can be just as good without her if you make it that way. I'm saying this cuz I'm in the same boat. I get so attached to my boyfriend that I can't imagine losing him, but I need to remind myself that he shouldn't be the sole purpose of my happiness.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I am so sorry you had to go through this. And I think this might have to do with why you have this sort of  #8220;attachment #8221; to your classmate. You #8217;re looking for something in her that feels like your ex took from you. Maybe even that comfort you once had with your ex, you wonder if this girl can give you. One thing I learned from having shitty exes, is to find happiness from within yourself instead of someone else. And I say that to myself too. It #8217;s so important to be content with who we are, and love ourselves, and not let our happiness rely on others. Be so in love with who you are, that when you think of your ex, think  #8220;thank God she showed her true colors before we were married/had kids/ etc. #8221; instead of thinking  #8220;damn how could she do this to me. #8221; Be grateful you didn #8217;t waste more time with her because you need to know you deserve better than that. Love who you are and be content with YOU before finding that in another person.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A lady was once bargaining with the worker at REI. She was standing at the register and asking him if she can buy a jacket for $30 instead of $50. He kept explaining to her that he can #8217;t just sell it for cheaper. I almost chimed in and told her this wasn #8217;t a garage sale. Then she acted all dramatic about not buying it, probably thinking he will cave in and the dude gave 0 shits.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>He cried a lot. And i mean sobbing when i got mad at him for lying. And then the other guy when he told me he #8217;d kill himself if i stopped talking to him. Then told me he popped pills and pretended to go throw them up when I threatened to call his sister and tell her what he did. So maybe what i really mean is when they were emotionally unstable, that killed the crush.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think Love is a choice not a feeling. We choose to love someone. After being with someone for years, the butterflies die, the excitement isn #8217;t really there anymore, but you love that person because of who they are, not because of how they make you feel. You choose to love them even when you #8217;re angry or annoyed. You may not feel like the high school sweethearts you once were but you choose to continue to love them and put effort into the relationship. Look at all their good qualities, the things that made you fall for them in the first place. Sometimes people may change but it doesn #8217;t mean our decision to love them should. If you #8217;re committed to that person, look past their faults and continue showing love.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>When i was little, it burned when i peed. So my mom told me to start washing myself down there more often. One of the downstairs bathrooms had a sink that was between two walls and had about half a foot of space between the sink and walls. Instead of using my hands to wash myself, i thought why not just get naked, sit on the sink with my legs on both sides (between the wall and sink) and just turn on the faucet and have the water run and do the vagina washing for me. So i try and realize the water doesn #8217;t reach my vagina and it didn #8217;t work. As I #8217;m trying to get off the sink, i realize my legs are stuck. For some reason, i start panicking hard. I start crying and screaming with my legs spread, stuck between the sink and walls. My dad and cousin #8217;s husband were in the living room, they run over and since they hear me bawling, my cousin #8217;s husband just starts breaking down the door. My mom ran downstairs as fast as she could with the bathroom key to find our bathroom door broken, and me crying naked with my legs stuck around the sink.</TEXT>

I thought the world was a loving place UNTIL I WORKED AT STARBUCKS THAT IS. Damn people were hella mean! I got yelled at for not pronouncing a French pastry correctly. Got yelled at for pretty much anything honestly. But 99% of the yelling came from middle aged women. I blame starbucks for making me dislike strangers.</TEXT>

My fianc #233; said when he #8217;s at the drive thru window, a female coworker will take the order and when the girls drive up, they always have a bitchy look on their face until they see him. Then they #8217;re all smiles and super sweet. Working at Starbucks made me realize that sometimes girls/women aren #8217;t very nice to other girls for no reason. My coworkers and I would always be polite to everyone, but girls/women would have attitude and be mean back.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Pretty sure I was judged for my choice of snack before. I made the horrible horrible mistake of bringing beef jerky onto a plane. I forgot how strong it smells so I ripped a tiny part of it open and the smell punched me in the face. The lady next to me looked vegan so I was panicking on the inside cuz I was hungry but didn #8217;t wanna disgust her. I would slowly open it little by little and just sit there until the smell of a brutal burp would finally leave. Finally decided to go to the bathroom and ripped it open and waved my hands over, grabbed it and swung it around to air it out.</TEXT>
