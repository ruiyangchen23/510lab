    <TEXT>I have been itching for a "blueprint mode" since the early days of SimCity. It would be absolutely invaluable, and should be almost trivial to implement. I can think of no good reason not to include it. This is an urban planning game. Let me do some actual planning. Real urban planners don't design streets with a cement truck: they use pencils.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>On average I could play the beta for 15 minutes before losing the server</TITLE>
    <DATE>2013-01-28 01:42:37</DATE>
    <TEXT>After two days of on-and-off play, I was never able to complete the tutorial. My entire experience of this beta was 1) try to start (can't start, no server), 2) eventually get started 3) play for a few minutes 4) get interrupted when the server goes down or loses connectivity. Whenever the server would eventually come back up, various menus would be blank or invisible, preventing me from resuming without a force-quit. I am not a regular Reddit user, and this problem may have been answered or explained elsewhere. I am not complaining about the beta, the game looks beautiful, the music is charming, the menus seem intuitive, and it is a privilege to participate. But clearly, either I am having a severe technical issue on my end that the game is not able to respond to or else the servers/network system for this game is not anywhere near ready for prime time. EA wanted a network dependent game. Nay, insisted upon one in the face of overwhelming fan distaste. Well, in my experience it is an unplayable disaster: This is not a game I could possibly buy. So, EA, show us what you've got: You appear to have a lot of work to do to get this thing playable before launch. If we have to be online to play, the online experience has to be seamless and reliable. I'm curious to hear if anyone else out there had as miserable a time getting the network to stay up as I did. For what it's worth, I have a wireless cable router and I am paying Cox for their premium 50-MbPS down, 12-MbPS up connection (though actual rates certainly vary and rarely meet the as-advertised). So, in short, the problem was not low bandwidth or any known problems on my side.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have no explanation for it; I would really like to be able to play the game. I used the bug report form to explain what my experience is. I have no idea if I'm a typical case or an extreme outlier; I just know the server keeps cutting me off and that causes the game to wig out and menus to stop working. I really hope they work these issues out or issue some sort of FAQ guidance for troubleshooting this before the game is launched, or I think they're going to have a significant problem.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>How will EA write down the free game giveaway losses? How do they calculate losses from piracy?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2013-03-19 02:11:17</DATE>
    <TEXT>EA is giving everyone who buys Simcity by March 25 a free game, with a retail value of $20-30. Since it's been reported that they've sold something like 1.1 million copies of Simcity, that's a giveaway with a retail value of something like $25 million. Of course, accountants would rightly argue that many of the people getting the free games wouldn't have bought the retail versions at their current price, and the out-of-pocket loss to EA is just the upkeep on the download servers and related infrastructure, since only digital product is being dispensed. There's no loss to physical inventory. I would think the same argument would apply to people pirating EA's games--no physical product is lost, and if the buyer wouldn't have bought the game at any price legitimately, it is hard to put a dollar value on the "cost" of piracy. So when they calculate their losses to piracy, do they take the number of copies they estimate have been pirated and multiply by the retail value, or do they compute the value in a rational way, as I expect they will with the free game write off? I'm not justifying piracy; I'm honestly just curious if they will treat these two situations where free games are dispensed digitally with the same math. Does anyone know?

    <TEXT>Idea 0. Fix the agent system so everything works properly. Really no reason to make any other suggestions if this remains broken. I was in on the Beta and I enjoyed it, but the big problems with the model (not to mention the servers) did not appear in the one hour we were allotted. I won #8217;t buy the game until most players agree that the simulation works. If any of my suggestions have been encompassed by changes added subsequent to the Beta (and not mentioned in any of the reviews), please let me know. Idea 1. A Simulation About Urban Planning Should Have More Urban Planning. For a game that #8217;s ostensibly about simulating a city, Simcity versions have been curiously literal about the act of building things. In SimCity 4, if you screwed up a road, airport, or bridge placement, you had to reload to fix it. Now you don #8217;t even have THAT option! Ideally, in SimCity 5 I would like them to add the ability to enter a planning-mode, where I can sandbox different options before committing to them. And once I have what I want planned out, I #8217;d like to be able to get feedback from my citizens or advisers about what will or won #8217;t work out for the plan. That is, after all, how real cities operate.  #8220;Erasers are cheaper than jackhammers #8221;, as an architect once told me. More important than simple realism, this approach would encourage players to consciously think about planning their city growth, comparing the costs and benefits of different approaches, instead of just expanding, sprawling, and populating, which is how the games often played out. And, by removing some of the penalty for trying something new and daring that could fail (like, I don #8217;t know, a neighborhood with no cars, or a mixed-income subdivision), it would encourage experimentation. Of course, forcing players to build an endless stream of tiny, specialized micro-cities is another way to encourage experimentation. The wrong way. Idea 2. Regional Meddling Should Be Contentious, Like in Real Life In previous editions of the game, the Sim Nation would sometimes come calling with an offer, for example, to accept a monthly stipend in return for hosting a prison or a military base. This is realistic, as far as it goes. Cities really do get offers from the feds to build certain facilities, and often there is money in play. But the implementation was curiously unrealistic, and missed the way these incentives usually play out. For example, when the feds wanted to build an Interstate expressway along the Mississippi River in downtown New Orleans 40 years ago, city officials had very little control over the proposed route, leading to huge controversy. Eventually (thank god) the proposal was rejected, and so we still have a downtown riverfront. THIS is the drama and tragedy of federal construction projects! When major Sim Nation propositions come up (and they should), they should be heart-rending for the player: Accept a major interstate right through your historic downtown, or turn it down and miss out on millions of possible new residents? Or, for that matter, accept a federal highway subsidy but tick off your residents by increasing the legal drinking age from 18 to 21 and adding DUI checkpoints on weekends? It would be interesting to see some federal meddling that forced regions to band together or compete, as the various winds may blow. Idea 3. The Mayor Should be Corruptible As far as I know, among simulation-type games, only Tropico ever embraced the idea that what #8217;s good for the people and what #8217;s good for the omnipotent ruler are not always perfectly aligned. Tropico rewarded you for building a successful economy, but it also rewarded you for stealing money from the treasury, making back room deals, imprisoning your rivals, and otherwise enriching yourself at the polity #8217;s expense. This is a hugely important point for any realistic city simulation (or any study of human governance), and one that could make playing SimCity much more compelling. Moreover, it #8217;s a topic that SimCity 4 broached, but they got the moral calculus almost completely wrong. In SimCity 4, you would occasionally get two competing offers, one  #8220;good #8221; and one  #8220;evil #8221; (take a job skywriting  #8220;I love you Janet #8221; in a stunt plane, or you crop-dust  #8220;zombie powder #8221; over cemeteries to raise an army of the dead for the local mad scientist). If you did the  #8220;good #8221; mission, you got a boost to your approval rating. If you did the  #8220;bad #8221; mission, your approval was hurt but money was placed in the city treasury. So, let #8217;s get this straight: When a politician does a good deed, she is personally rewarded (with popularity), but when she does an evil deed, the city benefits (via new revenue). That #8217;s exactly the opposite of how corruption works! Moreover, previous versions of SimCity would reward the mayor with a new, bigger house based on the growth of the city, which was pretty much the mayor's only personal reward and was also pretty unrealistic. SimCity 5 would have been more interesting if, as mayor, you chose whether decisions will benefit you personally at a COST to the city, and make some parts of the game only available to a  #8220;corrupt #8221; mayor. For example, perhaps you get a bigger house if you choose to build a project with contractor willing to give you kickbacks (and who will then go on to do an inferior or more expensive job). Or perhaps you have to bribe someone to get a sports team to relocate to the city, but doing so risks a scandal and accompanying loss of popularity. As a New Orleanian, I #8217;d like to see the effect of adding an inspector general or getting a top-notch federal prosecutor appointed, but let #8217;s not take it too far. Idea 4. The Game Should Ask Deeper Questions of Environmental Consequence In general, SimCity has never asked any questions about what the land was like before your city took root. Empty space contained trees, it #8217;s true, but otherwise very little was lost when you built a giant new highway interchange or industrial park. Meanwhile, although pollution has existed, there are only two kinds of pollution:  #8220;air #8221; and  #8220;water". In today #8217;s world of environmental controversies and citizen activism, the standard SimCity approach seems more and more dated and simplistic. It would be better, and socially responsible, if the game could ask and answer mature questions about greenhouse gas emissions, light pollution, noise pollution, and other forms of city-impact. Also, it would make the game more dynamic if the city planner had to occasionally fight environmentalists to gain access to new land, or on the flip side, to restore wetlands to protect against storm surges, or battle deforestation to prevent landslides. For that matter, previous versions of the game made natural disasters totally random. In reality, the city planner should have a pretty good sense of whether an earthquake or a hurricane is a more likely threat, and this should inform municipal disaster preparations. These are extremely relevant issues, and ones SimCity is uniquely positioned to address for a popular audience. The game designers have a responsibility to create a relationship between the city and the natural environment that is meaningful and instructive. Idea 5. There Should Be More (and More-Interesting) Minigames I am not aware, strictly speaking, of any minigames in the new SimCity. What a missed opportunity with a whole city to play with! Here are just a few possible minigames, off the top of my head, which SimCity could add using the existing game engine. a. Dabbling in managing a university, trying to match degree programs with student interest to get enrollment up without busting the budget b. Doing research at a medical center, perhaps by assigning specific doctors to specific tasks. This could also create an opportunity to try to lure a specific expert from a different facility (or a competing player #8217;s city) to increase the effectiveness and prestige of your center. c. Solving a crime, perhaps by identifying a location from witness testimony or looking for clues at a crime scene. d. Organizing a rail schedule, perhaps one linking several regional cities together based on local demand (there is an entire game, Railroad Tycoon, based on this premise, so it is clearly something that can be made both fun and instructive). e. Laying out an amusement park (again, there is an entire game, Roller Coaster Tycoon, based on this premise, so it clearly could be made into a workable minigame). f. Learning to sail or pilot a hot air balloon would require learning about local wind and water patterns, and would tie the player more closely to the landscape of the game world. g. Similarly, hunting, fishing, farming or birdwatching could allow the player to experience local flora and fauna in an intimate and instructive way. Instead, they axed farming all together. Good job, Maxis. Idea 6. While we #8217;re dreaming, I #8217;d LOVE it if SimCity actually worked</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks for this very enlightening reply. And this would be a very sensible way to calculate the cost of giving away free or discounted games AND the cost of pirated games. But my question is: How does EA actually do it? Do they divvy up nevers-mights-haves when deciding what they are losing to piracy? Do they tally rebound-DLC sales when writing off a free game giveaway? It would make sense to do it this way. But I sort of suspect they over-count piracy losses.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think you've identified a really great metric. Tie the ability to do certain things to approval rating. If it drops below, let's say, 30%, pop up a note that says "protesting citizens have blocked eminent domain" and take away the ability to bulldoze anything. Or if it goes above above 80%, you could alert the player that "overjoyed sims are volunteering at city facilities" and knock down the daily cost of buildings.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't know, I think a blueprint mode or an undo would be really feasible and it's something a lot of people are asking for. Regional challenges that could force cooperation or competition among cities is not only possible, I understand it is supposed to happen (whenever, you know, they get regions to work). The other changes are more speculative, but I don't think they'd be very hard to implement in some form. Anyway, as you said, it's a good exercise.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Some Thoughts on the Science in "Gravity" Several things about this trailer are hard to explain from a space science point of view. Someone brought up several criticisms in comments on Wired, and I responded basically as below. I'd like to reproduce that discussion here (the original can be read at: http://www.wired.com/underwire/2013/05/first-gravity-movie-trailer/) Curiosities: *Why are there explosions? Things in space aren't made of dynamite. *Why is the ISS shown burning up in the atmosphere? Even if you ripped ISS to pieces, it would take months for them to reenter. *Wouldn't it be really hard to make something heavy like the Space Shuttle Orbiter spin around like that? You'd have to hit it with a bus. *Why is there sound in space? Trailers like this are a great opportunity to discuss how science and engineering are presented in film, so it's good people are getting that discussion started. Of course, the writers and director should be taken to task for anything that proves to be inaccurate in the released film, but I think most of these issues can be, hypothetically, explained. On the explosions: I only see one explosion, and it appears to be the explosive decompression (with an orange combustion flame) of an ISS module. I can't explain why that would happen, but it does appear that there is a Soyuz reentry chute already tangled up around the station by that point in the plot, so it is possible something has already gone very wrong on the station. If (speculation) there were a fire in a contained module, and the pressure ran away (why? I dunno, movie reasons), it doesn't seem totally implausible that it could detonate. Would it look like that, or would it just unzip and stop with no swarm of debris? I don't know. Are there emergency pressure release valves on the modules to prevent that? I don't know. I do see a LOT of collisions, as well as some things being torn off by reentry drag forces, which are all reasonable. ISS reentry: Would reentry take months for the ISS? It would, all things being equal. Perhaps for reasons not yet clear, they intentionally try to de-orbit some or most of the ISS. Perhaps the ISS is already in danger of reentering when the movie starts. Or maybe the reentry scene takes place weeks after the rest of the action in the movie timeline. Tossing an orbiter around: In order to spin out an orbiter like that, you'd need to hit it with something huge. Perhaps that is what is proposed to have happened. Note that this orbiter was named "Explorer" so this is clearly a fictional universe. Perhaps in this universe, there are weapons on board. Or even a war underway. Orbital kinetic kill vehicles (spacecraft that ram other things at very high speed) are designed to create mayhem just like the kind shown here, and the United States has built working prototypes for use against enemy spacecraft. Look closely at the scene where the orbiter's Canadarm is severed by something very big, very black, and very very fast passing across the reference trajectory of the orbiter much faster than any part of the ISS could be going. Space rock? Enemy impactor? Remember, the Cuar #243;n #8217;s last movie was Children of Men, so he's known to work with dystopian futures where humans make life miserable for each other. Sound in space: Well, sure, that's a little dumb. In fairness, some of the "sounds" of impacts and what-not appear to be soundtrack hits, not Foley work. In other words, it could be for the trailer only. Perhaps in the actual movie, the sound will be handled more realistically. Also note that some actions should be heard inside the suit of the astronaut performing them (I am thinking of Bullock's character detaching from the Canadarm with an audible "click"), and it would not be unrealistic to portray those; but clearly anything not in physical contact with the astronaut would be completely inaudible. Also, as people have pointed out, Soyuz spacecraft (which the stars are seen climbing around on at various points) have a history of bizarre reentries. Accidentally remaining attached to the service module until it burns off, reentering wrong-side-first, reentering out of control; if you can think of it, a Soyuz has done it, and the people aboard probably survived. If everything went haywire on ISS, you would still have a pretty good shot of surviving if you could just get into a Soyuz descent module: Those things are as close to invincible as space engineering comes. I'm pretty sure that's something the screenwriters are counting on, here. In short, the weightless dynamics seem spot-on, the hardware depicted is extremely realistic, and the general scenario, a catastrophic hardware failure in low Earth orbit, is both plausible and terrifying. I will withhold judgement on any inaccuracies until we have some additional information about the premise and until we know why that ISS module exploded in an orange fireball, which is admittedly very peculiar.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Gravity Plot Speculation (by a Former Rocket Scientist)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2013-05-14 07:18:50</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've probably thought about this more than is reasonable. Oh well. Here is the closest theory I can come up with for this movie that is physically plausible (perhaps not quite possible) and explains the various scenes shown in the trailer. Warning: I was a propulsion person--and not even a particularly bright one--not an orbital dynamics person or an EVA person, so I am speculating a LOT on the orbital and EVA plot points. If anyone has better information, correct away. 1. The story takes place in a Children of Men-style dystopia where the US and China are engaged in extreme brinkmanship. Either the movie takes place in the fictional past or a fictionalized present because there are still shuttle missions and one orbiter is called "Explorer". 2. One of the two Soyuz spacecraft docked at ISS undergoes some bizarre catastrophic failure causing its reentry chute to deploy in space while making some sort of uncontrolled attitude adjustments, putting ISS into an unstable orbit. The chute tangled up on the station prevents whatever contingency plan NASA would have had for this. 3. Astronauts Clooney et al are sent on a crash shuttle mission to remove the chute or do whatever else is needed to save ISS (I hear Bullock is supposed to be a bio engineer of some kind; perhaps she is station science crew, but is drafted to do a spacewalk because of the gravity of the emergency--I figure normally a life sciences mission specialist would not be on a repair spacewalk). The situation is so dire that Explorer doesn't even dock. ISS is only hours away from reentry. 4. But at a crucial junction, Chinese hardliners launch multiple kinetic kill vehicles at ISS (hit by meteors? Come on, how likely is THAT?). Explorer is destroyed, the station is crippled. Bullock is hurled into space. All contact with ground control is lost. 5. Heroically, Clooney uses a Simplified Aid for EVA Rescue (SAFER) unit and pursues Bullock. They connect via tether but are far from the station and on an unconnected trajectory. Also, everything is going to reenter in hours. The SAFER is nearly out of fuel. 6. Clooney and Bullock spend some time peacefully in orbit: "Beautiful, don't you think?" "What?" "The sunrise." They take the opportunity to go over their Oscar speeches. 7. Bullock uses that big PhD brain and calculates their trajectory will bring them closer to the station debris on the final pass before reentry. The second Soyuz may still be functional, and we all know a Soyuz reentry module can survive almost anything. They use the last of the SAFER fuel to set up the rendezvous. 8. With atmospheric effects becoming noticeable, they realize their burn was not enough; they will miss the Soyuz. But Clooney uses the tether as a slingshot, sacrificing himself to hurl Bullock toward Soyuz. An action scene ensues while Bullock bounces off stuff. Clooney drifts off into space, never to be heard from again, until SAG nominations. 9. Bullock makes it aboard Soyuz as the last of her oxygen expires (or, more plausibly, her CO2 scrubber is expiring or her suit circulation system is failing). She seals and presses the crew compartment, de-suits (we skip what must be a tremendously satisfying bathroom break), and is able to raise Mission Control on the radio. She's the only survivor of the catastrophe. 10. She has to get the Soyuz undocked and untangled from the parachute and who knows what else. Bullock dons a Russian spacesuit, and goes out the hatch. Somehow this involves blowing up a module of the ISS and a very expensive 17 minute continuous cut of harrowing space violence. But the Soyuz is freed. 11. She spends a calm moment, watching the aurora borealis as the sun sets. The tiny light of her cabin is the only sign of mankind's troubled attempt to dominate space. The words "For Your Consideration" appear tastefully on the screen in Futura Narrow. 12. But there's more bad news; ground telemetry indicates there is a malfunction on the Soyuz service module, and Bullock must complete ANOTHER spacewalk to make repairs or she will not survive reentry. I have no idea what this could be; just about everything imaginable has gone wrong on Soyuz at some point and they always seem to make it. Maybe it's something wrong with the chute, as the Russians are having pretty regular trouble with chutes by this point in the movie. Or maybe they know the service module won't separate, a la Soyuz 5 and Soyuz TMA-11. Both those missions survived but landed off course. In this case, landing off course will put Bullock in the Pacific ocean right in the middle of Super Typhoon Stanley. She has to manually fiddle with something to get the module free. Reentry in 30 minutes. 13. Back out the hatch she goes, and she almost drifts off again, but gets a Hollywood assist and survives by grabbing onto the last possible (not actually existent on a real Soyuz) handrail. All sorts of parts of the Soyuz are ripping off due to reentry effects by now. Against all odds, she completes the repair and makes it back into the descent vehicle, which tumbles into a brilliant fireball but does that whole Soyuz thing and somehow survives. 14. Bullock lands on Earth amid a staggering shower of ISS debris. As she crawls out of the smoldering wreckage at regular Earth gravity, you realize this is the first non-CGI scene in the entire movie. You also have the vague feeling a different director will feature Bullock in an inferior sequel called "Buoyancy," set on a disintegrating cruise ship. Credits.</TEXT>

But unless the movie is not actually about astronauts, shuttles, space stations, and reentry problems, then I have a hard time believing I am 100% wrong... perhaps 80%.

    <TEXT>Your face won't melt off in direct sunlight, even direct sunlight in space. I think you would develop a sunburn if you persisted in leaving the visor up, and the sun is about 20% brighter in space, so it will injure your retinas faster than on Earth if you looked right at it, but chilling out with your sun visor open would not cause immediate injury. Here is a picture of astronauts Jerry Ross and James Newman during the very first ISS construction mission. You can see that Ross has his sun visor partially open, and direct sunlight is falling on his face. No melting. He's keeping his eyes shaded, which is good practice, but if it were possible for a mere glint of sunlight to blind him, I doubt NASA would allow operation in daylight with the sun visor even partly retracted. http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/gallery/images/shuttle/sts-88/hires/sts088-702-024.jpg And here is ESA astronaut Christer Fuglesang, hard at work in daylight with his sun visor fully retracted.

    <TEXT>The Guardian and the Washington Post both broke the story simultaneously, and both show portions of the "41-slide" Powerpoint that explains PRISM. But neither has published the entire Powerpoint. I wonder if there is more information forthcoming, or if they chose to self-edit to protect some particular state secret.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I appreciate your nuanced response, but I don't think it makes any sense, because it hinges on the claim that "privacy doesn't come in degrees" and therefore since it is theoretically possible for your information to be compromised, your expectation of privacy is zero. That's not at ALL congruent with the real world. Let me give you three quick case studies: 1. I tell my wife of many years that I have inoperable cancer. I ask her not to tell my parents yet because I don't want to ruin their anniversary. She is the only one I tell. 2. I write about my thoughts about my cancer, using a secure browser, into an email on Gmail, but don't send it. It is saved on the Google servers. 3. I post about my cancer on Facebook using a laptop over an unsecured WIFI network, but with the security setting on "Friends Only." In each of these cases, I have a plausible expectation of a MEASURE of privacy. Specifically, in the first case, I have a high expectation of privacy based on personal trust. Can I be absolutely certain that my longtime spouse won't betray me and write a letter about my cancer to the New York Times? No: However unlikely, it is not totally impossible. But the fact that betrayal is POSSIBLE does not make my expectation of privacy zero, as you postulate. It's silly to even claim this. In the second case, I might reasonably assume (or even legally believe after studying the law), that my unsent Gmail is secure and private unless I am the subject of a search warrant by the government. Knowing I have committed no crime, I may judge the odds of my information being intercepted by the government as being very low, and the odds of Google sharing my unsent email with the government as slim to non-existent. In the third case, I have to contend with the possibility of my transmission being intercepted by an unscrupulous signal hacker, or of any of my friends reposting or otherwise sharing my information. My expectation of privacy is therefore very low, but I still might expect SOME measure of privacy, specifically, that Facebook will not allow anyone who visits my site to read this status; only friends. You say "Privacy doesn't come in degrees, you either have it or you don't". In that case, everything you've ever told anyone in a dark room EVER is compromised and you have, by your own rationale, ZERO expectation of privacy of it, as if you had posted it to your public blog. You say "that information you request is being held securely in my head." Of course it isn't. You've told SOMEONE your social security number. SOMEONE knows your name and birthday. So why not just tell us all right now? Is it because you realize you are unprepared to deal with a world where Reddit knows all that information? How does that gel with your claim that you live with an expectation of zero privacy? Why aren't you PREPARED for the world to find out all your secrets? Of course we all know the answer: Because between zero and infinity, there are degrees of privacy. The entire function of social society depends on this fundamental fact. And this week's Verizon and PRISM revelations demonstrate that our public expectations of privacy are being hugely, radically violated. Specifically, item 2 on my list is now officially NOT private. It is (perhaps) immediately redirected to an NSA server, which is not bound by Google's terms and conditions and whose policies and practices with that data are secret. You seem inclined to try to shrug this off, but I don't see how you can make the claims you make and remain internally consistent.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Here is the world David Simon is living in. The government has: *A precedent that allows the president to kill citizens in secret without prior judicial or legislative review *The power to detain prisoners indefinitely without charges or trial *Ongoing warrantless surveillance on millions of Americans accused of no wrongdoing, converted into a permanent database so that data of innocents spied upon in 2007 can be accessed in 2027 *Using ethnic profiling to choose the targets of secret spying, as the NYPD did with John Brennan's blessing *Normalizing situations in which the law itself is secret -- and whatever mischief is hiding in those secret interpretations *The permissibility of droning to death people whose identities are not even known to those doing the killing *The ability to collect DNA swabs of people who have been arrested even if they haven't been convicted of anything *A torture program that could be restarted with an executive order (list borrowed from Conor Friedersdorf) Moreover, as David Simon HIMSELF has pointed out, the US imprisons a larger part of its population than any other nation, in the midst of a massive, multi-decade and world spanning "War on Drugs" that HE HIMSELF has called a "holocaust in slow motion." "The war is about the disposal of what Simon called, in his most unforgiving but cogent term, "excess Americans": once a labour force, but no longer of use to capitalism." (from the Guardian) And THIS GUY, who thinks the government is trying to dissolve its own citizenry, and has all the powers laid out above, has the COMPLETE IDIOTIC BALLS to call critics of a MASSIVE GOVERNMENT SURVEILLANCE STATE "self-righteous bloviators" for finding this worrisome? He is calling US that? Seriously? What world is he living in? Then he has the head-up-assedness to say: "For us, now  #8212; years into this war-footing and this legal dynamic  #8212; to loudly proclaim our indignation at the maintenance of an essential and comprehensive investigative database while at the same time insisting on a proactive response to the inevitable attempts at terrorism is as childish as it is obtuse. We want cake, we want to eat it, and we want to stay skinny and never puke up a thing. Of course we do." What an idiotic strawman unworthy of response! As I've said a dozen times, terrorism kills less Americans than furniture. This is an imaginary war against a non-threat, and he's tut-tutting as if there's an actual tug of war between security and privacy here. There isn't. We faced down the Soviets for 50 years with nuclear arsenals ready to blow up the world, and he thinks there's a serious existential risk from a few idiots with pressure cooker bombs? Or does he just think everyone else believes that? I don't know which is worse. Moreover, he says this isn't a scandal because there's no proof of any misuse of data. Except we can't KNOW whether there's misuse, because the entire project has been kept totally secret. THAT'S the scandal! He's acting as if the government has been totally transparent, and people are being unreasonable for reacting badly to something we've asked for. Nonsense. People are reacting badly because the government has gone haywire and Congress/the White House literally don't think we even have the right to know what they're doing. Apparently he's very comfortable with this, because he says "I #8217;m a bit amazed that the NSA and FBI have their shit together enough to be consistently doing what they should be doing with the vast big-data stream of electronic communication." Yeah, and I'm sure none of that will ever be abused. For example, to target people in the drug war Simon somehow just managed to totally forget about. Or in the Occupy movement. Or in the civil rights movement (as the FBI did to MLK). Or by corrupt Baltimore cops. What a complete, naive hypocritical IMBECILE.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Again, I appreciate the careful response. By your definition, the only private information on Earth consists of things people have thought of but never told anyone or written anywhere. If that's your definition of privacy, I suppose you're not being inconsistent, but it's not the definition of privacy that ANYONE else uses. For example, most people would call their favorite sex position "private information" even though at least one other person knows it. Also, and I have to keep harping on this, you seem to have difficulty differentiating between something that isn't 100% guaranteed and something that doesn't EXIST. Private information I have shared with close friends is not 100% guaranteed to remain private, but it IS private, at least for now and probably for the foreseeable future. Similarly, my bank account is not guaranteed not to be hacked and cleaned out tomorrow (there is a non-zero chance of this), but I do have a bank account. Since you argue that anything that isn't guaranteed doesn't exist, and that privacy cannot be guaranteed in pretty much any case, what you're actually saying is that privacy doesn't exist, never existed, and never can exist. That strikes me as a cop out answer to the question "what should the government be able to learn about its citizens"? There are real, practical differences between societies where the government is constrained against digging up dirt on its populace, and societies with runaway surveillance states. I would rather live in New Zealand than North Korea, for example. If we postulate that privacy never exists and is meaningless, we lose an important ability to differentiate between REAL and SIGNIFICANT policies that make a practical difference in people's lives. Saying "what's the big deal? Privacy is a myth anyway" would have been small consolation to Martin Luther King when the FBI was bugging his hotel, or to Vaclav Havel when the Czechoslovakian secret police came in the night and carted him back to prison. It's as if we were trying to decide how to feed the hungry, and someone said "well, we all die anyway so why bother to feed anyone?" It sounds blase and cynical, and it doesn't really advance the debate or offer a meaningful policy to govern by. In fact, it seems like a good way to make sure the worst possible outcomes are realized.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>"Nothing has changed legally" Except the Patriot Act (passed in 2001, modified and extended in 2011). And the FISA amendments, which expanded the FISA scope in 2006 and 2007. And the telecom immunity bills in 2008, making it legal, retroactively, for telecom companies to break laws on illegal wiretaps. And that's just off the very top of my head. NSA insiders have SAID, on the RECORD, that their domestic spying only took off after September 11. So right there, THEY disagree with you that "nothing has changed". (http://video.pbs.org/video/1051968443/) DaRizat, domestic surveillance has been changing legally, technologically, and practically for the past 10 years, and has been doing so RAPIDLY. Today, nearly every American carries around a sophisticated voice, location, and digital communication tracker (with a camera). That was almost unthinkable 20 years ago. And the legal basis for massively harvesting this data has been expanded again and again, sometimes on the basis of debate, and sometimes in complete secret. Those are just facts. Moreover, YES, a small group of powerful individuals can leverage data of that sort to create "a massive government surveillance state". Why would I dismiss that possibility? It HAPPENS. Over and over. In Russia (with lesser technology, no less), in the various Arab states, in Korea, and yes, in the United States. Do you think, for a moment, that these technologies weren't employed against Occupy and other dissident groups? They aren't just for identifying terrorists. Anyway, you toss out the "small group" term without really thinking about it. The US intelligence community has about a hundred thousand employees, being VERY conservative (actual numbers are classified). That's not counting the US military and non-intelligence bureaucracies. (see a very quick estimate here; I've seen better descriptions in books but I can't link to them http://askville.amazon.com/people-analysts-intelligence-community/AnswerViewer.do?requestId=5894012) I'm not some paranoid conspiracy theorist. I'm just reacting to the facts we know, and a little historical perspective. I don't feel like you have any historical information, perspective, or research behind you here. You either don't know anything or aren't thinking before you post. And I find your "before I deign to debate you, start by admitting you're wrong and I'm right" strategy more than a little patronizing, given how totally wrong your factual claims have been. Oh, and by the way, you said we "haven't been converted to a military state". You know we spend more on the military than any other government by 500%, right? If you mean "we have a civilian commander in chief", yes, but if you mean "we haven't tossed out basic human services in the name of building the largest military behemoth the Earth has ever known" then you are again, factually, wrong.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think I now completely understand your position. I find it peculiar, but since I get it, I won't further challenge it. Your distinction between "personal" and "private" is useful. I might have used the words "private" and "secret" instead, respectively. (For the record, do you recognize any distinction between "private" information and "secret" information?) I would like to ask you a few questions, though, to understand how your perspective shapes your life. You can answer hypothetically, if you think literal answers are too personal. Let's say you were trying to open a restaurant, and had done some market research to identify where best to open the restaurant. A competitor stands by your window every night, listening to you talk to your bank about securing a lease to the building in the perfect place. The competitor swoops in and buys the building, thwarting your plan. Has she done anything wrong? Are you particularly surprised? Your doctor tells you about a medical condition that could increase your future insurance rates. What do you do with this information? What should you do, in a perfect world? Now say you run an insurance company, and doctors perfect a new tool that can better predict who will need expensive care in the future. You know you should raise these people's rates. What do you do? What should you do, in a perfect world? Finally, say someone perfects FMRI technology that is so good that it can actually predict, with 99% certainty, what you are thinking about. Does the government have the right to use this technology on 1) suspects of crimes 2) people who may have information about suspects of crimes 3) everyone else</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Also of interest to this story, an [interview](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/war_stories/2013/06/brian_jenkins_fears_nsa_overreach_a_top_terrorism_expert_thinks_government.html) between Fred Kaplan and counterterrorism expert Brian Jenkins, and a [Foriegn Affairs piece](http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/137279/micah-zenko-and-michael-a-cohen/clear-and-present-safety) on the United State's relative safety. Jenkins says there have been 42 attempted terrorist plots in the United States since September 11. 38 have been thwarted. The other four resulted in 17 deaths. If all 38 were thwarted by NSA surveillance (which is obviously the best case for the NSA's justification for doing what they're doing), then the absence of NSA surveillance would have caused something like an additional 161 deaths over the past 12 years, if the successful plots were "average". Let's be really conservative and assume the thwarted plots were ALL 5 times more deadly than the successful ones! That would mean the NSA prevented 807 deaths in the past 12 years. Over that span, there were about 186,000 regular murders in the United States. Thus, the NSA plan can, at ABSOLUTE BEST, claim to have reduced the chance of an American being murdered (which is already very unlikely) by 0.4%. And for *that* we're going to give up any hope of privacy? [edited to fix the links]</TEXT>

And again, just so I understand you: we should live our lives under the assumption that emails and texts are not private, "no excuses". And anyone NOT willing to have their emails exposed to the world "shouldn't be using the internet at all." Am I characterizing your views fairly?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ok, let's recap the claims you've made. 1. "Nothing has changed legally." Factually inaccurate, as you have admitted. Things have changed just in the past 2 years when the patriot act was amended in 2011. 2. A "massive government surveillance state" is impossible because there aren't enough government people do pull it off. Factually inaccurate--in fact, hilariously inaccurate. See the world's largest population in China. See also Russia. See also the Church Committee report that showed, beyond any doubt, that the FBI was abusing surveillance programs and using them to intimidate Civil Rights leaders here in the United States in living memory. They tried to induce Martin Luther King to kill himself, among other transgressions. The error of your claim that surveillance states are impossible because of the small number of government employees needed to run them is so glaring that I was tempted not even to further respond to you, but you have kept digging, so here we are. In any event, I pointed out the actual magnitude of the surveillance force employed by the US government, (on the order of a hundred thousand people, not counting the military, and outside contractors) a fact you simply ignored. 3. You used a straw man, asking "how a database of an estimated 900 billion cell phone calls per year (remember we are talking phone numbers and GPS data only) in the US will result in some sort of audio or video surveillance effort on a single innocent individual or group of individuals". Since I never made the absurd claim that a telephone metadata database could be used to create "video surveillance" on anyone (what does that even mean? Printing it out like the matrix and animating it? What are you thinking?), I simply ignored this particular bit of bad reasoning. However, we now know that PRISM could indeed intercept Skype, so the US DOES INDEED do audio and video surveillance on single individuals, including US citizens. Are they "innocent"? I don't know. Ed Snowden says yes, they often were. If you know more than he does, perhaps you should talk to the Washington Post about it. In any event, you created a strawman argument and still managed to be wrong. 4. You point out, as if it proves YOUR point, that "Simon has detailed how this has nothing to do with terrorism and how law enforcement has been allowed to perform this level of data collection without probable cause on individuals who are not suspects and who have a *reasonable expectation of privacy* for decades." And then you used the fact that law enforcement has been abusing people's rights for decades as evidence that worrying about the NSA having access to all your records is paranoid. No: Years of police abuse are a PRIME reason to recognize that governments abuse their power and, as you said, that this is NOT JUST ABOUT TERRORISM. Interestingly, you yourself said the people having information gathered had a "reasonable expectation of privacy". Humorously, you later denied that any such thing really exists. 5. "If you want my honest opinion, I don't really feel like digital communications such as text and email should fall under reasonable expectation of privacy." That's total BS, and you know it. If someone stole all your email and posted it online, you'd be furious and fearful against identity theft, and rightfully so. You do NOT, day to day, act as if none of that material has no expectation of privacy (the way you do, for example, when you post material to your Facebook page, something that ACTUALLY has no expectation of privacy). What I suspect you MEANT to say was "I sort of vaguely know the government might be watching my email, but I am pretty confident that I'm a needle in a haystack, and any obscure crimes or bad behavior that I ever might have revealed this way are so minor, that no analyst will ever flag me for investigation. I can live with a person I've never met in a cubicle far away seeing an embarrassing chat transcript, if they even ever got around to me, which I doubt they never will." The fact is that people DO communicate on email with an expectation of privacy. Not paranoid people, not internet n00bs, or anyone else you want to tarnish with dismissive ad hominem attacks. Regular people use email every day to discuss medical diagnoses, financial problems, business strategies, and all the other things that are synonymous with "expectation of privacy." And you do it too, unless you're a no-email, no-online-banking, all transactions by self-hosted bit-coin, no social media, no cell phones Luddite. And if you are, why are you accusing ME of being paranoid? 6. "Show me when they illegally monitor a phone conversation or wiretap a home." Define "illegally". It's tricky in this case, because the government has always blocked legal challenges of these programs. The ACLU and EFF have tried, repeatedly, to force the NSA in court to explain and justify what they're doing, and the government shuts down the cases with claims of national security or lack of standing. The fact is, we don't KNOW whether they are illegally monitoring phone conversations. We know they're monitoring phone conversations, that's obvious. But whether it is legal is not at all clear. I will show you the proof when someone reveals it. If no one does, we can't resolve this point. 7. "...explain to me why the would do that to a 20 something student who organized an occupy protest. Then I'll jump on board and maybe even exercise my 2nd amendment rights." [Of course](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/05/fbi-occupy-wall-street_n_2410783.html) they were surveilling Occupy protests. It's not even secret that the FBI was heavily tracking them. But look, now that you know the truth, *please don't do anything violent*. Maybe I'm nuts, but it sounds like you just publicly threatened to "exercise my 2nd amendment rights", which could be interpreted as a threat against a federal agent. I must make perfectly clear that **just making a threat against a federal agent** is a FELONY punishable by 10 years in prison. I would never condone violence toward anyone, seriously. Please, let's keep this discussion civil and not toss around incitements to violence, even in jest.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I feel like we got off to a bad start. Here you are, talking about "exercising your second amendment rights" and admitting to sexting and using the f-word a lot, and you sound a little dangerous. I'm sorry if I was provoking you. So let's start over, because clearly there's no reason to get this agitated about what you have repeatedly stated is essentially a non-story. No reason to threaten anyone or get all bent out of shape or say anything we regret, because as you say, these posts are public and permanent. I will happily give you back your points 1-4. Because David Simon says so, we can pretend that the security state is static. Because we are limiting ourselves to only talking about what David Simon says, we will just forget about the Church Committee and pretend that the US has never been caught abusing its powers to try to sway controversial movements. In fact, we'll just pretend that's **impossible**, because 100,000 dedicated intelligence experts is just a small number of people, and they couldn't possibly do anything bad to the other 300,000,000 of us. I'll just accept that you know that's true and that's good enough for me. We DO know that recording phone calls is something they do. It is "obvious", because they went out of their way to list Skype on the PRISM training slide. Why would they do that if they didn't want the trainee to know that Skype could be monitored? Just a plug for a cool service? No; Skype was a monitored service. Now, did they monitor *improperly*? That is, without proper legal orders? I don't know. Snowden said he himself could eavesdrop on your Skype without a warrant and could do it even if he knew it was two Americans in America and that it was against policy. In other words, he says there was no oversight to prevent abuse. Maybe he is wrong, and I make no claim about it. If there is evidence forthcoming, we can talk about "improperly monitoring" calls. But that fact that calls were monitored is, yes, obvious. "Where are they getting the manpower to monitor the 99%?" I didn't realize they had to monitor 99% of the content of all phone calls to trip your trigger. You originally wrote: "Show me when they illegally monitor a phone conversation." Singular. One case. Are you moving the goal posts? My reason for bringing up the Occupy monitoring was not to prove there was anything illegal about it, or even necessarily improper about it (I can prove neither). You said "explain to me why the (sic) would do that to a 20 something student who organized an occupy protest" and I simply proved that yes, given the ability to monitor occupy protesters, even 20-year-old nobodies, they would indeed do it, and DID do it. They had the motive, the intent, and the opportunity to use this technology against Occupy. There was, according to the whistleblower, no oversight to prevent them from doing it, even if it was against policy. I can't tell you whether they did it or not. I don't have any "FUCKING PROOF." What do *you* think they did? I hope we can continue in a more civil tone.</TEXT>

You've offered zero evidence, zero references, and every SINGLE thing you've asked me to show to prove my point, I have shown. Since you have an inexplicable urge to hear how US phone calls were improperly intercepted, here you go, from the front page of Reddit, right now: "Exclusive: Inside Account of U.S. Eavesdropping on Americans U.S. Officers' "Phone Sex" Intercepted; Senate Demanding Answers" http://abcnews.go.com/print?id=5987804 That story is 5 years old. There have not been any reforms since then. You don't seem to know ANYTHING that you're talking about. You're trying to sound blase ("this is nothing new" "who cares if my occasional sexts get intercepted" "show me some REAL evidence"), but you just sound ignorant: Ignorant of the evidence. Ignorant of history, even RECENT history. Ignorant of how people are corrupted when they are given power in secret. What your argument really comes down to is this: "I am nobody. I'll never be anybody, or try to do anything important. So why would the government care about me? They will be busy using their surveillance to destroy important geniuses like Aaron Swartz or Martin Luther King, who are trying to make the world a better place or who threaten the establishment, not nobodies like me. But who gives a damn about any of that? I have an XBox. This story doesn't affect me at all." And you know what? You're absolutely right. You have the right to disagree with me, but you haven't earned it. You've offered nothing to this debate except moving goalposts, straw men, diversions, distractions, and denials.

    <TEXT>Anzat, I can see where you're coming from. But you've made some errors here, and I think you're reading the wrong subtexts and drawing the wrong conclusions. When Snowden and Obama differ on "wheeling and dealing", it helps to look at what each of them might mean by that term. Obama might mean "I am not going to give anything up to get Snowden back" and that might very well be true. It's consistent with Obama's "we're not going to scramble fighter jets over a 29-year-old hacker" comment. Meanwhile, from Snowden's perspective, I presume his most pressing priority is that the US not interfere with national processes concerning his asylum requests. From his perspective, Joe Biden's "cordial" phone call with the president of Ecuador certainly qualifies as "wheeling and dealing." When the vice president of the United States calls you, Anzat, I assure you the president of a small country listens very closely, and [Rafael Correa's complete about-face](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jul/02/ecuador-rafael-correa-snowden-mistake) on Snowden proves this pretty well. Does that make Obama "dictatorial"? No, but those are your words, not Snowden's. I'm just saying that from Snowden's perspective, the US is INDEED wheeling and dealing, furiously so, to prevent him from being granted asylum. You can justify that (I guess), but there's no reason to misread what Snowden is complaining about. I agree with your semantic argument about the word "exile". Snowden is not, by any literal definition of the word, "in exile." But given the [extraordinarily harsh treatment] (http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2012/03/manning-treatment-inhuman/) of Bradley Manning (called torture by some legitimate authorities on that topic), it is reasonable for Snowden to fear that his rights will be infringed if he returns, i.e. that a fair and swift trial free of cruel and unusual punishments is impossible. So, although I grant the word "exile" is being used figuratively here, it seems uncharitable to deny that Snowden is, at least within reasonable use of the word, in a state of functional exile. Also, with his passport revoked, he is stateless and is pretty much trapped at the Moscow airport. That's a very literal sort of exile. You say you wish the story were entirely about the ~~CIA~~ NSA. I totally agree with that. You also say the story shouldn't be about Snowden personally, but that his "rhetoric" distracts from that goal. As best I can tell, over a month in which he has become the most wanted person on the planet, when his face has been plastered on every TV, when his dad, girlfriend, and neighbor have all been featured in front page stories, and when leaders of several major powers have called him a hero or a traitor... over that whole month of glory and infamy, Snowden's TOTAL outside communications with the world have consisted of: one video interview with the Guardian, one newspaper interview in Hong Kong, and the 400-word statement he just released (two whole paragraphs of which were just thanking others). Anzat: If *that* is what you consider "self-aggrandizing narcissism" that is inappropriately "distracting" from the NSA story, what on earth *would* you consider appropriate and humble behavior?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, that's pretty close to what I thought you'd say. You've totally ignored my point, perhaps it was above your grade level. My analogy IS apt, and if you can't see why, then, in a wise man's words, "you are too biased for rational thought." When people with guns show up and slap handcuffs on you, they create a dangerous situation in the exact same way that an unarmed person giving a bank teller a note describing a bomb is creating a dangerous situation. In fact, making a false arrest is, under many circumstances, a felony also, so I think the analogy works on several levels. You keep repeating, over and over like some sort of mantra, that the man had an "obligation to restrain his pet", but you keep forgetting, over and over, that the only reason he was *physically unable* to restrain his pet is because he was being **restrained in handcuffs** by police officers who made a conscious decision to escalate a (legal) annoyance into an (arguably illegal) physical confrontation. When you look at the two act separately, you intentionally omit the chain of events which led directly, though not inevitably, to the outcome. That's not a difficult point for most non-apologists to comprehend. There are other cops in this very thread saying the same thing: "The cops could have handled this so much differently." Only *you* (and a handful of trolls) seem to think starting the tape at the end -- when the man is in cuffs and the dog is "lunging" (i.e. hopping) -- is justified. And why wouldn't you? It's the only way to get the cops off the hook, which was your predetermined goal, wasn't it? "Fuck" my feelings, eh? Yes, patternfall, your extreme maturity really comes through there. If determining that "out-of-control cops murdering dogs on the street" is a bad thing gives me the "emotional maturity of a teenager" then I will gladly accept that I should start hanging out with teenagers. What is "right" and "satisfying" would be for cops to obey the law and be subject to punishment when they screw up or commit crimes, just like the rest of us. If that sort of "idealism" lands me behind bars, I shudder for my country. But I'll know who to thank.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The problem is that these laws are prosecuted **totally inconsistently**. For example, you may recall that last year the NY Times ran [an article](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/29/world/obamas-leadership-in-war-on-al-qaeda.html?pagewanted=all amp;_r=1 amp;) describing Team Obama's anti-terrorism policies in minute detail, including his policies on assassinations of uncharged terrorism suspects--even US citizens. That article cited dozens of top administration officials; this was clearly a coordinated effort to create a story that portrayed Obama in a flattering light. And yet all the information was delivered anonymously, and it had to be, because it was all classified. And yet there were no accusations of treason. No calls to throw anyone in jail or force anyone to flee to Russia. See also this [little dichotomy](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/28/chris-hayes-glenn-greenwald_n_3516010.html). See also [here](http://www.salon.com/2011/10/10/the_real_danger_from_classified_leaks/). Here are the facts: If you leak something that the government tells you to because it makes the government look good, that is celebrated. If you leak something embarrassing that the government tells you NOT to, then you are "a traitor." But the crime is the same: revealing classified information. As you say, that IS a crime, but a crime that is only enforced against the marginalized, while the powerful enjoy impunity, is NOT a just law. If you can't recognize that there is something profoundly dangerous and unfair about this dynamic, then you really aren't in a position to discuss the Snowden situation cogently. When you say "there's nothing wrong with accepting it as normal that the government would enforce laws against revealing classified information," it reveals that you are either unaware of the information I have just provided, or that you have considered it and rejected it. If the latter, what is your rationale for doing so?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Has a decision been made about this? I would like to get my friends involved, but I need an itinerary to promote. If a public place (with whatever necessary permits) is not possible on such short notice, perhaps we could contribute to rent out a location in the quarter for a party in a very well-trafficked area where we could make an equally strong statement. I feel like a New Orleans protest is best when coupled with a party. But I am up for whatever.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Clearly I don't believe "every police interaction in the US ends in someone dead" and nothing I said could be so construed. It's rare. But even a rare event, if horrible enough, merits serious concern and change. It so happens that it is not, unfortunately, particularly rare. Why, it so happens there is an [entire blog dedicated to it](http://dogmurders.wordpress.com/). And I know for a fact that blog has omitted many cases, because I know of others here in New Orleans that are not mentioned there. And that's just a single, very narrow type of police brutality. Anyway, what I do (or, to be a stickler, *don't*) believe about police brutality rates has nothing to do with the legality of this particular case. And your argument, as of now, consists of "It was legal. Because nothing there was illegal." So you might want to work on your side of it a bit. For the record, I assert that 1) the suspect was within his rights to play music and heckle/film the police. If the area was an active crime scene, the police should have established a larger perimeter. Most of them are just standing around anyway. 2) The police unnecessarily escalated the situation by detaining (or arresting; this is unclear) the suspect. He was compliant; it is not obvious that a verbal warning would not have been sufficient to diffuse the situation. 3) The suspect did fail to secure his dog (when it leapt out of the car's open window), but the officers had a chance to correct this and failed to do so, so they share the blame. 4) The dog was then free, but not inherently a threat; a smart officer could have released the (again, totally compliant and never violent) suspect to deal with the dog peacefully. It's not like the suspect was a raving murderer who was moments before waving a machete around. He was heckling. That is obnoxious but not an immanent danger. 5) Someone else brought up that it was not safe for the officer to discharge his weapon when there was a large crowd of onlookers just feet away. I suppose this is debatable. But I would also note that if the "hostage negotiation" or whatever was going down was SO SENSITIVE that music and heckling were going to create an emergency, then what must the hostage takers have thought when they suddenly heard a burst of gunfire? In other words, if the situation was *that sensitive*, ALL THE MORE REASON for the cops to handle it delicately. But no. Anyway, I don't think you're reading me very carefully or thinking very hard about this, so I won't waste any more time on it unless you see some merit in continuing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well, I have certainly voted. And I have certainly called my congresspeople. And I'm not a hero to the people. So maybe we're exactly alike. "I will celebrate my 4th of July as I see fit, I will continue to do what I do everyday." Hey, I guess I'm not *exactly* like you. ... Also I edit and help publish a [satirical magazine](http://nolevee.com/?p=1638) that has quite frequently angered officials in my hometown. They haven't sued me, yet, but I do live in a city (New Orleans) known for political dirty tricks, so I would hardly be surprised if one day they did. I don't use a pseudonym. I'm proud of what I write. Also, I financially support several organizations like the ACLU, EFF, Freedom of the Press Foundation, and others, that regularly stir things up. Also, I have marched against the Iraq War twice, once in DC (before the war started) and once in NY (after). We were right about that, incidentally. But a lot of people took your point of view and didn't show up. I wonder if things might have ended differently if more people had been more like me and less like you. I'm feeling less like you every second, actually. Also, I'm active in two different local volunteer organizations that advocate for policies related to wetland restoration, something fairly important to New Orleans but contrary to corporate interests. One of the groups meets every month and for the past 3 years has been hosting and judging an entrepreneurial contest to reward and publicize the best [water management technologies](http://www.nola.com/business/index.ssf/2013/03/wave-breaking_device_wins_the.html) produced in New Orleans that year. Hey, you know what, now that I think about it, we're NOTHING ALIKE! I'm actually trying to make a difference, even if it means sticking my neck out and infringing on valuable drinking time, and you, well, you're *you*. Enjoy your 4th as you see fit. That's your right.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks! You know, I had read that before, but I stopped after the first sentence. If you have a moment (it's not particularly important), how does fuzzing the result block spam bots? Does it confuse their algorithms somehow? I find the gaming (and, of course, anti-gaming) of websites interesting. (musing aloud) Perhaps the spambot sees a 13-10 vote and says "I can sway this really easily with 10 votes" but if it sees "103-100" it says "anything I try to do here is at best going to tweak the overwhelming public opinion, why bother?" On the other hand, a spambot could see 300-0 and think "woah, no controversy here, why waste my time on a blowout?" but see a 10300-10000 vote and say "it's pretty much 50-50, I should wade in and try to shift the dynamic". So it could go either way... That psychology has an interesting parallel to voting under a two party system in a large electoral population. Anyway, thanks for your answers.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; If you are indeed an American citizen you are just as free as I am. Let's put any acrimony aside and actually address this point, because this is really where our disagreement lies; not how much we donate or how much time we spend volunteering. You think we're free. I think we're not as free as you think we are. So let's look at this. Let me define freedom in a very simple way that anyone should be able to agree with: You are not free if you are in jail. Are we still together on that? And if so, let me add a corollary: Your freedom is not secure if you are in DANGER of going to jail, not by some mistaken identity but for actual things you did that people can PROVE you did. So, for example, a murderer is not secure in his freedom, because if word of his crimes comes to light, he will go to jail and not be free. So the question is two-fold: 1) Who decides if we are "criminals" and 2) Who has the power to bring our "crimes" to light. I don't think of myself as a criminal. I certainly don't plan and execute crimes. I'm sure you don't, either. But, I assure you, we have both broken the law. Have you ever [violated the terms of service of a website](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/01/aarons-law-violating-a-sites-terms-of-service-should-not-land-you-in-jail/267247/), for example, signing up for email under a false name? You could be prosecuted under CFAA, as Aaron Swartz was. Have you ever posted a silly threat on Facebook, followed by "lol jk"? You could be sitting in jail right now with a $500,000 bond, for "making terrorist threats", as [Justin Carter has been](http://www.cnn.com/2013/07/02/tech/social-media/facebook-threat-carter/index.html). Has anyone you know ever done drugs? Did you report them? If not, you could be guilty of misprision of a felony, depending on your jurisdiction. Even if you never touched a drug yourself. The fact is, there are no non-criminals in the United States. There are [too many rules for that](http://www.amazon.com/Three-Felonies-Day-Target-Innocent/dp/1594035229), and prosecutors have too much latitude to define whether a broadly-written crime or regulation has been violated. There are only criminals who have not yet discovered what crime they committed. Whether you know about it or not, it is a serious problem, and one I am trying hard to remedy. But it's an *entrenched* problem. You can pretend it's not happening because nothing has happened to you YET. One day, though, someone may take notice of some minor thing you did, and decide it rises to the point of a felony. You actually have no control over this. If this line of thinking has moved you at all, I highly urge you to read [this short article on the topic](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2203713). Now let's talk about the second point: Who can reveal evidence of your crimes? We are moving into an era in which everything we do, everything we write in a moment of anger, everything we look at, every suspicious or innocent pattern, is being recorded. Couple that with a law that can be twisted to make a wide variety of behaviors into crimes, and you have a recipe for MASSIVE incarceration. That means you are NOT free, because your freedom could be threatened at any moment by someone with authority who doesn't like you. Our only protection against this is the Fourth Amendment, which explicitly forces the police to have probable cause before they can troll your documents for evidence of some crime, any crime. And so I am protesting. So, let's see. If I'm right, you'd have to see people being thrown in jail left and right. If I'm wrong, nothing like what I described would ever happen (or at least, it would be vanishingly rare). Let's look at the statistics. [America is the world's number one jailer](http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2012/11/30/1261301/rate-of-incarceration-declines-but-us-remains-worlds-number-one-jailer/?mobile=nc). We imprison more of our people, for longer, for smaller offenses, than any other country on EARTH. We imprison more juveniles. We are one of a small number of industrialized nations that practices the death penalty. We even execute people for non-murder offenses. Also, people paroled from prison lose many of their constitutional rights for the rest of their lives. Even people who take felony plea bargains that totally avoid prison will often lose the right to vote or bear arms. People who insist on a trial face decades of prison if they lose, because of increased sentencing laws from the 1990s--their lawyers urge them to accept felony pleas, even when they believe they are innocent. Most prosecutions never go to trial; people are just declared felons and released back into the wild. And still the prisons fill. So I have to wonder: Are you just ignorant of all this? Do you just not care? Is it not your problem? Do you think this is just going to fix itself in a few more years? You bluster a lot about how free and unaffected you are, but I don't really see where your confidence is coming from. We're in trouble as a country. We're not particularly free, as the statistics prove, and we're getting less free all the time. I'm going to do something about it. You're going to go have a beer and watch fireworks and brag about how nothing ever changes for you. Maybe neither of us will change anything, but we're not alike.</TEXT>

For example, did you down vote [this post](http://blog.reddit.com/2013/01/aaronsw-1986-2013.html) in commemoration of Aaron Swartz after his suicide? If not, why not? Did you down-vote [this post](http://blog.reddit.com/2012/01/technical-examination-of-sopa-and.html) against SOPA? If not, why not? What about [this one](http://blog.reddit.com/2012/09/internet-2012-bus-tour-campaign-to.html) in favor of open Internet? I'm not trying to challenge your rationale, I'm just trying to understand what is your threshold for penalizing Reddit blogging for advocacy. If you're consistent about it, good on you.

I also think he should face some criminal charges in the US, for mishandling documents and the like. But the fact that the US has charged him with an outdated espionage-act crime that carries the possibility of life in prison, plus the fact that we've not done too well getting Bradley Manning a fair trial, on the balance, leads me to think he's right to seek asylum.

    <TEXT>By "we", I just mean the US system of justice, which includes UCMJ. And he was most certainly treated in a peculiar fashion (forced to stand at attention naked, having his blankets confiscated, being held in solitary confinement for weeks). These are relevant facts, and do not require any particular similarity between Snowden and Manning, other than, as you agree, the fact that they both divulged classified information. Also, they have both been charged under the WWI era espionage act, which is also significant, I'm sure, to Snowden if to no one else.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes, all very true. I have tried to stay neutral on Snowden, the man. There's an asylum process; we should let that play out. There's a legal process. We should let that play out, too. History can judge whether what he has done was on the balance good or bad. But I should say, I *do* think that we know enough to say that Snowden's primary motivation, at least hitherto, has been whistleblowing, i.e. revealing things about the government to force reforms, not for personal gain or to help a foreign government. If that balance shifts, I am willing to admit it when it happens. To the extent that the US government is a) overcharging him and b) interfering with his ability to seek asylum, I suspect they may be backing him into a corner and increasing the odds of him revealing something really destructive (I think those odds are long, but not zero). To that extent, the US might be hurting itself in the long run. Time will tell.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well, I was really just repeating your statements back to you, which seemed ludicrously self-contradictory. "I am injecting cynicism here! Anyway, go vote if you want to change the world!" It sounded pretty funny to me, honestly. But am I cynical about voting and court challenges? I think I'm realistic about the "actual mechanisms for people to manage government." Elections can be effective locally. On the national level, most congressional districts are gerrymandered so completely that it is very difficult to mount a successful challenge to an incumbent. Both of my senators are highly entrenched, and one of them (David Vitter) got reelected by a bible-thumping citizenry despite being caught visiting prostitutes. So yeah, I guess I'm pretty cynical about that. Court challenges are a total crap shoot to me. You would think, with hundreds of years of jurisprudence and thousands of pages of law and legal opinion to draw from, that two different expert judges would be pretty likely to reach the same conclusion about the same facts. But it's not so. Courts get reversed, then re-reversed, and then appealed, and on and on. Common sense is jettisoned, the English language is twisted until it is meaningless. So that could work. Or not. See [the Commerce Clause](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commerce_Clause). So. Do I think that a bunch of people with signs and Guy Fawkes masks can do anything? Well, it seems like Anonymous has indeed accomplished some good *and* bad things, so I am not sure what point you are trying to make by bringing the masks up. Seems to weaken you. But, ignoring your strange example, can *protest* change things? I think it has about the same chance as elections, frankly. But it has other benefits. A new movement has not had time to be captured by large-money mechanisms, so there's that benefit. And I am not going to stand outside with a sign until things change. I'm going to meet like minded individuals, exchange ideas and information, and then I'm going to approach my state representative, who I went to college with, and see if we can introduce some state laws addressing this. I'll also write some articles about it for a small paper I newspaper I edit and help publish. And then, who knows? I don't know. You don't know. But I'll be doing something, making new friends, having new experiences, and trying to make a difference. Meanwhile... you will be... um, what were you doing again? Drinking, right? I mean, I'll be doing that too. I guess I just know how to find more hours in a day than you.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have been listening to OC Remix for a very long time. More than 10 years, I guess. Wow. I admit, I listen to it less today than I did then. If I had to put a finger on what prompted the decline, I guess I felt that the selections being remixed were either 1) from new games I hadn't played and which I wasn't particularly curious to hear revisited or 2) from the same group of 10 or 15 highly-popular games from the NES and SNES era. So my question is: Do you think there's an issue with game repetition on the site? Do you think it's a problem? Are there great or at least memorable game tunes from the 80s and 90s that are getting too little attention? And what can the community do about this? Again, I really do love the site and please keep up your important creative work. And bring back AmIEvil.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I want to thank you for trying hard to address this. I can't say your explanations are crystal clear, but they are better than nothing. However, I would like to raise two counterpoints: 1) If, as you generally assert, the rules were followed correctly in this case and those rules are important to protect 14th Amendment rights, is it appropriate to say that these rules are in need of some reform? That is to say, granting that "the rules were followed correctly," should we conclude that there is something wrong with these rules? Arguing that "complex rules are sometimes necessary," as in your health care law analogy, seems insufficient to me; complex rules can also conceal huge problems. 2) Likely or unlikely: All else being equal, if the defendant were NOT a police officer, but were instead a person accused of hitting a police officer, would the court have still found a way to exclude the video? Do you accept the possibility that the law is being applied in an unusually elaborate and "sophisticated" way in this case to provide a favorable outcome for a police officer? Do you accept that such scenarios are, to put it mildly, not unheard of? Does this real history change your legal perspective of the outcome in any way?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>See Gigiya's answer above. The amount of complete ignorance here is amazing. He did all his leaking at once. The documents are all in the hands of the various media outlets he shared with. The articles are coming out at the rate that those media outlets can vet, report, do background and write stories about them. The end. If you want everything to come out faster, then you are saying he should have leaked to more journalists, or just posted everything online and let the world sort it out. Most people seem to think that would have been a bad idea. This is what it looks like when you vet and weigh leaked documents to minimize damage and reveal only what is in the public interest (at least in the journalists' view). It takes time. I am really baffled by, on the one hand, a chorus of people saying "he just took documents and leaked them indiscriminately. That's bad!" and another chorus saying "why is it taking so long to see all the documents! He's just doing this to stay famous longer! That's bad!" Snowden may be a criminal, but neither of those claims is true.</TEXT>

I am concerned, however, to hear the the encryption itself in MS software has been compromised. This story raises many questions and gives few answers, and I can see that this may be a big problem for us, if cloud-integrated MS software is fundamentally built to allow external access. I am not an IT professional, but I know that Office 2013 is entirely internet-integrated. It's built into the DNA; every option seems geared to put your data online. Can I tell my boss our information is secure "as long as you don't save to sky drive"? I'm not qualified to say that. I'm also not sure that's true!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You keep calling it Greenwald's claim. It was a claim printed on a PRISM slide, and reported verbatim by the Guardian (co-written by Greenwald) as such. They went to the tech firms and asked them if it was true. The tech firms said no. [They printed the two claims side by side, and suggested it remained unclear what was correct.](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/06/us-tech-giants-nsa-data)  gt;The Guardian has verified the authenticity of the document, a 41-slide PowerPoint presentation  #8211; classified as top secret with no distribution to foreign allies  #8211; which was apparently used to train intelligence operatives on the capabilities of the program. The document claims "collection directly from the servers" of major US service providers.  gt;Although the presentation claims the program is run with the assistance of the companies, all those who responded to a Guardian request for comment on Thursday denied knowledge of any such program. It was the Washington Post--separately--that straight up claimed that PRISM gave NSA direct access to tech company servers. They did NOT seek out quotes from tech companies, and later had to edit the story to include tech company denials. This chain of events has been clearly stated by Greenwald and everyone else involved in these disclosures. Go back and read the original Guardian PRISM article. If that's your only reason to doubt Greenwald, I think it's *you* who needs to be more careful with your claims. Greenwald is an advocate; it's reasonable to be skeptical of him and his claims. But you need to be clear on what actually happened if you want to credibly challenge the facts of this developing story.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>10 Reasons why Pacific Rim was Terrible (spoilers)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2013-07-29 07:41:03</DATE>
    <TEXT>I saw Pacific Rim this afternoon; I was not impressed. A friend of mine #65279; suggested that I didn't like Pacific Rim because I don't like the giant monster movie genre. I disagree. Here are some of the specific reasons why I thought Pacific Rim was a lazy, idiotic movie that insulted my intelligence even by the low standards of the summer blockbuster. I wasn't taking notes while watching it or anything. These are just the things the came to my mind afterward. [I believe this movie is unspoilable, but I do discuss the plot below, so beware.] 1) It failed the Bechdel Test, badly. Only one woman, Mako, had a speaking role (not counting some incomprehensible gibbering by the Russian pilot and the girl in the shelter who screamed at Charlie Day), and Mako needed a) permission from one man to fight and b) help and guidance from another man to survive, even though she was supposedly a "brilliant" tactician and soldier. The first time she was put into the fighting machine, she was LITERALLY transformed into a crying little girl who had to be "rescued" in her debilitating memory trance by her male copilot, who interrupted her real rescue, IN THAT MEMORY, by the OTHER male authority figure. She was rescued *twice* in the same sequence *simultaneously*. In all her screen time, she contributed nothing at all except to enable the main male character to fight and win the war because of how "compatible" she was with him. I mean, that is some 1950s sexual politics right there. I'm surprised they never sent her out to make coffee. 2) The fighting machines were all over the map, and didn't follow their own rules. We see the Gypsy Danger (use racist names much, Jagers?) grapple with kaiju a dozen times, and only in the very final instant of combat in the movie do they reveal that the large turbine engine on the ventral plate can shoot a super-hot jet that kills a kaiju instantly when at close range. Introducing a new, never-mentioned weapon to kill the final boss is just sloppy, lazy screenwriting, especially given how many times a "kill the giant creature that is bear hugging me" button would have been useful in this movie (i.e. every single damn time anything fought anything). I made the commitment to suspend my disbelief in magical technology that allows a 30-story robot to walk around and not just collapse under its own weight, but I STILL continuously found myself thinking "why don't they have a weapon that does X" or "why don't they use their Y gun right now? It worked pretty well earlier," or "how come that one attack killed Z, but now it isn't even fazing it?" Just set up rules and play by them; don't jerk us around. You can have consistent rules for your weapons and combatants and still have bad-ass fights. See lightsabers. See also The Avengers. Note: If shooting a kaiju in the eye with a flare gun stuns it, I would go ahead and create a cheap Jager that shoots about a million flares at every kaiju around. Flares are cheap and stunning one for even 3 seconds could decide a battle. But I guess I'm smarter than ALL THE ENGINEERS ON EARTH in Pacific Rim. Also, radiation shielding for the pilots: Not that hard or expensive to do, and probably not the last thing on the Jager designer's mind in the real world (I am a former Space Shuttle engineer). Hey, actually, the pilots are already armored. Just make the armor radiation-shielding. Problem solved. Here, it's $249 on Universal Medical: http://www.universalmedicalinc.com/Lead-Aprons-s/227.htm. 3) The whole world is threatened by giant monsters that literally cause a half-trillion dollars in damage every time they show up, and all the nations of the world decide that spending money on their military budget is a bad idea and cancel the highly popular, highly successful, "rockstar" Jager program? What universe is this set in? What possible military objectives were the United States and China spending their military budgets on in this future? The TSA? I can only suspend my disbelief so far. I was SURE they were setting up a twist that the world government was secretly behind the kaiju invasion, because that was the ONLY WAY they weren't spending everything they had on Jagers all the time. I mean, come ON. Hong Kong is going to get flattened, and the entire Chinese government can't even bother to send a cruise missile or a fighter jet after these things? 4) The world's most grizzled Australian tough guy has to sit out the apocalyptic battle he's trained his entire life for, in which his SON'S LIFE IS DIRECTLY AT STAKE, because he slightly sprained his shoulder? The screenwriter has never met a real Australian: these people play rugby after double amputations. Surely his son could have just controlled that side of the jager for that battle. Earlier in the movie, the main character told Mako to switch sides with him FOR EXACTLY THAT REASON: His right arm was still incapacitated from the fight that killed his brother. So we know this is possible and, in fact, no big deal. 5) Glowy blue kaiju blood is acidic and toxic--so toxic that you can't just kill the kaiju with missiles because it creates a huge deadly spill--except when it isn't harmful at all. Like when Hannibal Chau gets eaten by one and then cuts his way out and is not injured in any way. 6) The brilliant scientist needs a 2-story high sliding chalk board covered in dense mathematical script to explain "the kaiju are showing up more frequently, and the increase is geometric"? That's like 10 cells in Excel. You spent $50,000 building, lighting, casting and shooting that scene. Pay me $100 and I will come up with something interesting for the scientist to say. It wouldn't be hard. For $150 I will add a joke. For $200 I will make it a sexual double entendre. For $250 I will put it in verse. Jesus. 7) The marshal has "fatal nose bleed syndrome" because of all that radiation he experienced piloting his Jager early in the war. Years later, "one more time in the cockpit" will kill him. I don't think radiation or cancer work that way. Anyway, presumably those incompetent engineers from Item 2 have had time 10 years later to figure out how not to irradiate the cockpit by now, right? No? Oh well. 8) It's almost impossible to find someone you're compatible with to operate a jager. In fact, finding compatible pilots is SO HARD, they had to dig up a 5-years-retired burnout to operate one of just four jagers remaining in the entire world. But when Mr. Australia's dad slightly hurts his arm, the brave Marshal jumps right in and copilots with the son. How come they're compatible? "I can tell you're an asshole with daddy issues, so I understand you and we'll be fine." Oh, ok, then. Guess pilot compatibility is not really a big deal after all. Too bad THAT WAS THE ENTIRE LOGISTICAL AND EMOTIONAL PREMISE OF THE ENTIRE FILM! 9) After a decade of giant monsters washing up on beaches and pushing over everything in sight, why are people still building giant glass skyscrapers that would be impossible to evacuate quickly and would lay waste to everything below them during a kaiju attack? Would you work in a skyscraper anywhere on the Pacific coast in this world? Also, did Hannibal seriously say that powdered kaiju bones sell for $500 a pound in a CITY BUILT IN A FRAME OF HUGE KAIJU BONES? Each bone was 15 stories tall and as big around as a redwood. Back of the envelope: each one of those ribs was worth $3.3 billion. Yet people just build houses out of them? PS, Hannibal, if you lived in Hong Kong you would have given the value in dollars per kilogram. 10) Every time anyone opened his or her mouth in this movie, it made the movie worse (possible exception, some lines by Charlie Day). Every time they shut up and let monsters fight robots, the movie got better. They spent a LOT of time opening their mouths. Anyway, I apologize if this is just a repeat of earlier discussions. But it makes me sad when a beautifully designed, beautifully shot movie that could have been a lot of fun falls flat because it was written with no attention to its own story points or basic narrative cohesion. I'm not even criticizing the 2-dimensional characters, the clunky story arc, and the ridiculous rip offs of RobotJox, Independence Day, and Armageddon ("If you're going to steal, steal from the worst," said no one ever). Forget all that. I just feel like no one in charge was paying attention to their own movie's rules or basic human nature. How is it possible the same person wrote Pan's Labyrinth?</TEXT>

It was part of a large series of plot decisions that infantalized the only female character, who was portrayed (in no particular order) as passive, obedient, distressed, uncertain, shy, and weak. Women are allowed to have parts other than "gets rescued". Putting them in that role is a choice. A very common one.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I feel like you aren't really engaging with my criticism. The men were never portrayed as being paralyzed by their memories. The men were never portrayed as afraid or uncertain. They were only portrayed as eager, even over eager, to throw themselves into combat. The filmmakers could have created a bunch of female characters and allowed them to feel a variety of sentiments about the war and the danger they were facing. They chose to have one character. They could have portrayed her as having useful ideas on how to fight the monsters. They chose to have her say virtually nothing (nothing at all that I remember) during any of the battles. They could have chosen to have her be a virtuoso in the cockpit. They chose to have her mentally break down and nearly destroy the entire hanger with her plasma gun until everyone can disconnect her and "shut her down". These are all explicit choices made by the filmmakers, and specifically assigned to the one female character they decided to include. These are very regressive choices. Now, in a good movie, I will allow for regressive female characterizations. I was not angry that Mia needed Vince to save her from an overdose in Pulp Fiction, because the movie as a whole was excellent and the characters were well-developed. But when you're served infantile pap that, on top of being horrible dross, decides to toss a few insults to women on top of the steamy pile, I am not very patient with it. In regard to the movie's portrayal of women being better than Transformers... I will grant that is true, but it's not a very ambitious goal, is it? I think we should expect better from del Toro. Wouldn't you?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Just to answer this using the movie's own logic, if pilots freak out often when drifting the first time, maybe don't set up their first drift in an operating Jager with armed weapons. Maybe instead do it in a conference room. Just, you know, thinking aloud here.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I admit in the scheme of things, this topic is not important and I have plenty of other things to worry about in life, but why move on? I *want* to discuss. I assure you that a suitable response will change my mind on any single logical point, though you're right that it is impossible to make me like a movie I don't like. But I will admit if I'm wrong about the substance of my critique. I started this thread to talk about it. Talking about movies you do and don't like should be fun. Also, you're just wrong about the way I watched it. I'm an engineer. I knew the premise was silly at the start. I swallowed the premise. I went to see a movie about giant robots. My criticisms ALL accepted that premise. I mean, I *could* have attacked the [really silly but so was Spaceballs and I loved Spaceballs] premise, but it was fine. I DO have a problem with movies that don't follow basic logical rules WITHIN their premise that allow the plot to function. Things like having a dude say "let's switch sides, my right arm is useless" and then a later dude say "my right arm is sprained, guess I'll have to sit out the most important battle of my life. " You know, *stupid* things. But go ahead, explain how that plot contradiction makes sense. Change my view.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I am trying to understand you, so bear with me. According to your rationale, all credit card records have no expectation of privacy, because it's a third party. Is that correct? So if the credit card agencies just decided to data dump all of our purchases into a searchable public database, you assert that no abuse of information has occurred, because credit card users have no expectation of privacy? Similarly, you say, over and over again, that you have NO RIGHT to keep your pornography viewing preferences private once you have told one person--ANY PERSON. Yet if I ask you right now to post your porn viewing records, I am fairly confident you will refuse indignantly, so you are still claiming a privacy right that you assert you don't have. How does that work? Moreover, forget your girlfriend. Everything you see on the internet is provided by a third party. Everything book you read, presumably, was sold to you by someone. If "anything that ever touched anyone else's hand or mind" is not protected against search without a warrant, then, good god, man, why would the police ever need a search warrant for anything? "We need to search your car. Have you ever brought it to a mechanic? No expectation of privacy, then." "We need to search your medical records. Do you ever go to a doctor? No expectation of privacy, then." "We need to search your emails. You didn't write this email code yourself, did you? You use an ISP? No expectation of privacy, then." "We need to search your house. I hear you had a plumber by last week. No expectation of privacy in there, boys." I mean, nothing you are saying makes a word of sense to me. You are LITERALLY ASSERTING that the 4th Amendment protects only documents that you wrote yourself, have had possession of yourself for your entire life, and have never described to anyone. Is that seriously how the law works? If so, why would anyone EVER get a warrant for phone records, or emails, or ANYTHING that is not 100% in our possession all our lives -- a category that doesn't actually exist? Explain it to my like I'm a rational person, not a lawyer.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; That's kind of how the privacy conception works: if Americans generally rely on something being private, and the individual subjectively believes it to be private, it's private.  gt; But the public has never been under the mistaken impression that information given to your ISP is private, and the Supreme Court made it clear decades ago that meta-data is subject to the third-party doctrine. I just don't believe you believe this. Every email you've ever sent was over a third party network. If you've never operated under the "mistaken impression" that this information was supposed to be private, then why wouldn't you freely give me all your emails right now? Metadata is not the only thing transmitted across an ISP; ALL DATA is. Are you asserting that NO DATA transmitted across an ISP is protected? If so, your own definition of how privacy works -- "if Americans generally rely on something being private and the individual subjectively believes it to be private, it's private" -- most certainly contradicts your next paragraph. If you are describing the law properly, then it sounds like the law makes no sense, because you're not making any sense. Also, "But, absent a state or federal law to the contrary, if you hand me a letter and ask me to deliver it I have every right to open it for funsies." Here is how I read this: "If it isn't illegal to open it, then it's legal to open it." I'm not trying to question your legal chops... but, um... that's some real fine legal analysis there, Lou.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I like and appreciate your "doors" analogy. It explains the analog world pretty well, and might have offered some comfort to a person in the 1990s. However, in the digital age it is completely useless, because once your internet service provider is treated as a "door," anything can be driven into or out of that door at any time. Your phone records, banking records, medical records, legal consultations, intimate conversations, reading preferences, religious affiliations, income information--**any privileged class of information you can name**--is now *routinely* transmitted online. And by your door metaphor, once you allow any of that information to pass out of that door, the door is open and the government has unfettered access to everything you have done. Moreover, their technology makes the collection of this information not a possibility, as in all your analogies, but a simple mathematical certainty. Looking at your examples a bit more closely: I let a mechanic look into my car, and for that moment, he sees nothing illegal and is free to tell anyone what the inside of my car looks like. Who would object to that? But the modern world we are facing is nothing like this. Imagine instead if the mechanic asked permission to just ride around with me, all the time. Imagine he had a photographic memory. And imagine he was best friends with a very suspicious police officer with a high arrest rate. I can say no, but if I say no I can't ride on any paved roads. My boss requires me to drive to get to work. My family requires me to drive to support them. That is the situation your metaphor actually describes: If you go online, you have ZERO ability to keep ANYTHING you've done private, the government absolutely believes this and will do everything they can to exploit it, and you simply cannot compete in the modern economy if you do NOT go online. Give up everything or starve, and have a nice day. It's all legal, from what you are telling me. Am I misunderstanding anything? Let's look at a funny little note I see when I do business with an acquaintance of mine who is a lawyer at a large firm: "This communication is from a law firm and may be privileged and confidential. It is intended to be reviewed only by the individual or organization named above. If you are not the intended recipient or an authorized representative of the intended recipient, any review, copying, or dissemination of this email and its attachments, in whole or in part, is prohibited. This email is for informational purposes only. The sender's name is not an electronic signature. If you have received the email in error, please notify the sender by reply email immediately and delete the email from your system. Thank you." Can you explain to this lawyer what sort of confidentiality this note confers? What does the word "prohibited" mean in this context? Are the lawyer and his entire firm totally ignorant of the law, as it appears from your statements? Or are they living in denial? If a large law firm cannot understand the fundamentals of the basic laws we live under, what can be expected of a non-lawyer? Or of congress? Or even of the NSA agents who are recording everything written here? Does the fact that you are living under a legal regime that is totally unsuited to actual life and totally misunderstood even by legal experts distress you at all? Now, I would like to talk about procedure. You explain that the 4th Amendment does not define a right, but explains a procedure police must follow. That is a very useful distinction and I thank you for it. However, even by that definition, we are living in a world where that procedure has become meaningless. The concept of "getting a warrant" is now *quaint*. Warrants are issued in blanket, in secret, for huge classes of communication. Those communications can be stored in essentially unlimited amount, indefinitely. The defense of requiring a judge to personally approve the warrant has been doubly defaced, first by ensuring a secret panel of judges selected specifically so that they will never decline a request, and second by making the request language so broad that literally any information is included. The procedure is "could this possibly be relevant to a possible terrorism investigation someday in the infinite future? Yes, by definition. Then we can have all of it forever. The end." Therefore, there IS no procedure. Do you disagree with this analysis? If so, how? One last question for you: Under your theory, name one single piece of information you control that you are confident is protected by the 4th Amendment from the NSA.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Can you link directly to the blog? That thread has about a dozen links and I am not sure which one you mean. I really get what you're saying, and I can imagine that a super fan of this movie, who parses every glance and reads supplemental material online, may be able to piece together a bigger, better story than the one presented in the theater. But that's not good filmmaking. I should not have to read a blog to understand fundamental aspects of the story in a movie. Little details, sure. But if I think a character is boring and two dimensional, then I should not have to do research to discover otherwise. Many great movies are able to get everything important onto the screen in two hours. As for filial piety vs feminine weakness, all I can really say is that you are free to interpret the movie however you like. The women I saw the movie with were appalled by it, so all I can say is that the writers did a poor job making the only major female character who had any dialog into a relatable person, and also chose to give her very dominating male companions. Japanese culture is, of course, hugely patriarchal, so maybe we're not talking about different things after all. Also, the only real evidence you provide of her strength is "she keeps her emotions in the background... keeping her rage and fear in check." I think it's a bit humorous that I watched a movie and said "in the end, the girl never did anything!" And you watched the same movie and said "that girl did a great job keeping everything bottled up!" I think my reading is more literal, and if we were using Occam's razor, I like my theory better. You essentially admit that you had to imagine watching Mako do things because nothing was ever shown on screen.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is an interesting theory. I would like to look at Marshall's decision making in a bit more detail, since you bring it up. You believe that the rift is opening wider, and will soon "stick" open due to the increased kaiju activity, allowing you to attack it with a nuclear weapon, deployable only by a Jager (there is a force field that will foil this plan, but you don't know it at this time). Therefore, you think, as long as you have Jagers, you have a chance to win the war. If you have 4 Jagers in all the world, and you believe they are the only mechanism by which the world can be saved, and you *also* know that they have been getting destroyed by attrition at a very high rate in the past, it seems to me that you will respond either by a) refusing to engage the kaiju under any circumstances to protect the remaining mech's for the day when you can strike a war-ending blow or b) if the kaiju *must* be repelled, then executing every battle in a way that ABSOLUTELY MINIMIZES the chance of losing a Jager. I know that's a long premise, but are we agreed on this? Now, let us look at Marshall's decision making. We know that there are two kaiju that just popped out of the rift and are approaching Hong Kong. Hong Kong does not appear to have a defensive wall, nor has China provided any protection of it whatsoever. So it is totally exposed, and right on the Pacific Rim, too! For some reason, millions of people are still hanging out in skyscrapers there, despite the obvious and predictable danger. So the death toll of the attack will be horrific. However, you also know that kaiju numbers are increasing, and eventually everything on Earth will be destroyed if you lose your remaining mechs. The REAL mission is to attack the kaiju rift. My response would be to let the monsters divert themselves destroying Hong Kong, and dispatch the Jagers to destroy the rift. It is lucky that Marshall didn't do this, since he didn't have intel on the force field, but my point is, his strategy was bad. Lucky, but bad. Now, let's look at the tactics. You have 4 jagers. There are two kaiju. These battles almost ALWAYS end in close-quarters grappling. In a real grappling fight, the best thing you can have when grappling is a free, standing friend who can tear your enemy to bits while you two are locked up. And, good news, you have 4 jagers to their 2 kaiju. But instead of taking advantage of the large numbers to ensure victory, you ground one crew and order a second not to engage. Predictably, the two you order to engage are totally destroyed. Of course, you can make a contrived argument that if Marshall had followed my sensible tactical requirements, the stronger numbers would have been nullified by the unprecedented kaiju EMP weapon. But again, that was not information he had. He made a terrible strategic decision, and then a terrible tactical decision, and won the war purely by dumb luck. I didn't bring this specific point up in my critique, because wars ARE won by luck sometimes. There's no reason that has to make the movie worse. But if you're trying to praise Marshall as a leader, I think he really was a sucky one. By sending his two weakest crews to fight two record-setting kaiju one-on-one simultaneously, something totally unprecedented, he left *everything* up to chance. He should have gotten bitten in the ass.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That was an interesting read. It was consistent with my friend's over-arching opinion: The movie would have been better with the sound off. That sounds like a dismissive criticism, but it's really not. As the blogger says, the movie had a lot of visual intelligence. I agree with that. As I said in my original post, it was beautifully designed and it only got stupid when people opened their mouths. If I ever watch it again, I will mute it and try to appreciate the visual symbolism untainted by the complete drool that was deposited in the script.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; Also, since you got me started, I think point 5 and point 7 are related. Just because kaiju blood is toxic doesn't mean it's effects are immediate, not unlike radiation exposure. Here is what the Pacific Rim wiki says: "Upon decomposing, their bodies release a noxious agent into the air known as "Kaiju Blue", their blood. Kaiju Blue has the ability to contaminate the air, making it non-breathable. The blood of a Kaiju is highly acidic, corroding anything in its path. This makes it especially hard to gather samples safely for examination and experimentation." I think that is unambiguous. It was stated in the movie also.  gt; they seem to give you just enough to move on as long as you're enjoying yourself Of course, we're free to differ in opinion, but as I laid out, there were plenty of plot inconsistencies that were so glaring or so different from my human experience, that they couldn't help but take me out of the movie. That's just me. To the extent that self-sacrifice and teamwork were themes here, I support that. But I didn't see anything that hadn't already been done in Armageddon (Bruce Willis blows himself up to save the world), Independence Day (Randy Quaid blows himself up to save the world), The Avengers (Robert Downey Junior TRIES to blow himself up to save the New York), The Dark Knight Rises (Christian Bale pretends to blow himself up to save Gotham), and on and on and on. Honestly, the whole "I'm going to set it to self-destruct and blow them all to hell in the nick of time" trope is pretty played out, don't you think? Do you really feel like any of that was original, or even atypical?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well, I was responding to your comment "...I found them a refreshing change from the dark, selfish, cynicism of movies as of late." I didn't see the big difference. But there have been plenty of excellent original films in the past few years. Haywire brought a totally new tone to the punch-up. Beasts of the Southern Wild was like nothing I'd seen before. Looper brought a bunch of new ideas into what could have been a tired retread. Cabin in the Woods chewed up a dozen horror movies and created something better. And that's just in the past, what, 15 months, just off the top of my head! It's my experience with Pan's Labyrinth, a marvelous and original creation, that raised my expectations of del Toro above that of Micheal Bay and his big-explosion ilk. I think your cynicism is totally baseless. I DO go to the movies for original things. I find them all the time.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I find the "take it or leave it" approach unconvincing (and unsatisfying). Are we really to divide all movies up into movies we "took" and movies we "left" and not have any ability to analyze or critique specific aspects that we liked or found dumb about any of them? That's not how I view movies, or how I approach life. I agree with you that it isn't good criticism just to state your opinion. That's why my original post laid out specific factual reasons why parts of the plot didn't follow their own rules, or were lazy or arbitrary. To the extent that I gave my opinion or expressed bafflement, dissatisfaction, or confusion, I backed it up with specific references to the facts that provoked those reactions. If you can write up a similar list for Looper, I encourage you to do so! It would be fun. I'd be happy to comment on that thread. I realize (I mean, it's obvious) that Pacific Rim and Pan's Labyrinth are different *kinds* of movies. My point in comparing them is to say that Pan's Labyrinth showed that del Toro is capable of creating resonating emotional characters, intriguing villains, truly tense situations, harrowing twists, and satisfying endings. Those are great skills that most filmmakers, honestly, lack. So YES, it is legitimate to say "man, how could the guy who brought us the horror of the Pale Man and the terror of Captain Vidal have also created the lukewarm menace of Marshall and the generic design of the kaiju? #8221; I am not necessarily levying those criticisms, understand, I #8217;m just giving a hypothetical. Using your example, we in fact see that Spielberg brought many of the same skills and talents to Jurassic Park as he did to Schindler #8217;s List: The ability to masterfully set up framing shots, an unprecedented talent for quickly sketching characters that audiences will love or hate or love to hate, demonstrating acts of bravery and self-sacrifice in a way that seems organic and is almost never cloying, and a way of creating a feeling of dread without showing or even being able to identify the threat. I feel like I have to keep reiterating this, but I #8217;ll say it again: I have no problem with love letters to Japanese giant monster flicks or mecha-anime. I REALLY LIKE those genres. As an engineer, I can reject 90% of the premise of these movies off the bat. I choose not to, because I WANT to watch giant robots fight giant monsters. I judge these movies not according to real-life physics; I judge them only according to the rules THEY kept describing. If you tell me kaiju blood is acidic enough to dissolve a building instantly, I won #8217;t ask how that is physiologically possible, I will accept it. But don #8217;t show me Hannibal Chau climb out of a kaiju carcass covered in blood and only slightly annoyed, unless you explain that he #8217;s immune somehow. If you tell me that j #228;ger pilots can switch spots if one of them has a hurt arm, don #8217;t later claim that a pilot has to sit out a critical battle because he has a hurt arm. If you claim that finding compatible pilots is almost impossible because they have to have such an intimate brain-brain connection #8212;such that most pilots are siblings, spouses, or one-in-a-million soul matches #8212;don #8217;t have two people who #8217;ve never piloted together and don #8217;t particularly like each other suit up and fly off together with no problems. If you claim that when a highly trained pilot is in a bear hug with a kaiju, there #8217;s nothing he can do except get pummeled and thrown, don #8217;t later show that his j #228;ger has a giant gun on its chest that can instantly kill a kaiju at close range that he just generally chooses not to use. I mean, this should be common sense: If you want to have imaginary giant robots, fine. But don #8217;t claim "X" and then later claim "not-X." I can #8217;t keep up with plots where the impossible rules keep CHANGING. You seem to want to dismiss me as someone who hates these movies. I am not. I *love* these movies. I hate inconsistencies and careless errors that make good movies into bad ones.</TEXT>

But the author's point is about the specific recent claims of a terrorist plot in Yemen that forced embassy closings, evacuations, etc. I don't entirely endorse the analysis, but it's a well posed discussion by an author with practical experience in these matters.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>First of all, this a fun item to read. All of us who protested in the streets, wrote our Congress, donated to activist groups, argued with our pro-NSA friends and family, got pro-4th-Amendment items onto local ballots, or just worried about the future of our country should pause for a moment and just be happy to see the public tide turning--dramatically and decisively--in our favor. But this is not victory. This is just the moment when we see that victory is possible. The reforms the Obama administration is proposing are "a necessary and welcome first step" but "they are not nearly sufficient," as the [ACLU wrote yesterday] (http://www.aclu.org/national-security/aclu-comment-president-obamas-proposed-surveillance-reforms). Even now, we have Congress members like Peter King [attacking Obama](http://www.mediaite.com/tv/rep-peter-king-rips-obamas-nsa-remarks-hes-allowing-traitor-to-pull-the-puppet-strings/) for even the minimal reforms he is deigning to offer us. People like Representative King, General Keith Alexander, and General Micheal Hayden who [say the program is fine like it is](http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2013/08/06/michael_hayden_talks_to_cnn_about_xkeyscore_program.html) are obviously dangerous to the country. *But they are not dangerous to our movement*, because the public and even the mainstream media have already accepted that we are right and the Haydens and Kings are wrong. What is dangerous to us now is the perception that cosmetic or superficial reforms are sufficient. What is dangerous to us now is declaring victory and going home, while those who spent hundreds of billions of dollars building this dangerous surveillance behemoth quietly spend a few million dollars to repackage it into something Americans can forget about again. What is dangerous is underestimating how vigorously those who built this system will work to defend it, even as they pretend contrition and offer illusory transparency. This culture of perpetual war and limitless surveillance must not be reformed. It must be **unformed**. Take heart in the progress we are winning, but do not let your attention or your passion flag. It is needed today more than ever before. Those are my thoughts on the media reaction linked above.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Former External Tank propulsion engineer here. Just to confirm, this photo would have been taken by the Space Shuttle orbiter, looking DOWN at the Earth, after ET separation. There's a good video of this sort of thing [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoNHhTyaxJg). A few other points of interest: In this photo, there appears to be some ice debris floating alongside the tank. [This kind of debris](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKoJg67vyxY) has been mistaken for a UFO by people before (it can look a bit like a space invader, actually). These photos would have been taken during the ET Photo Maneuver, in which the orbiter would pitch over to photograph the External Tank. From our perspective at ET Program, it was a chance to find out how much foam had popped off the tank during flight, for future quality control (this was a very important topic after the Columbia disaster). I'm not sure if NASA had any other use for these photos. Confirming nominal venting of residual fuel, maybe? Because the tank is not in a stable orbit at main engine cut off, it reenters and burns up, typically over the Indian Ocean. Good video of this [here](http://www.flickr.com/photos/nasamarshall/3953790458/). Most of the structure is lightweight aluminum, which burns up very well, but some of the heavier components did survive and would strike the ocean. It is aimed far from shipping lanes.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's a really good question. I came onto the ET program long after that idea had been floated and dismissed, so I wasn't directly privy to any of those debates. And I'm not an orbital dynamicist, so the delta-v question might be better suited to one of our Kerbal enthusiasts. The super light weight (SLWT) variant of the ET weighed about 60,000 empty; the orbiter weighed about three times that amount with full payload. So, just as an order of magnitude thing, I would think you'd have to have about 25% more propellant on the orbiter for the OMS burns necessary to stabilize and circularize the orbit with the tank attached. Here are some problems to think about: Dropping one tank off in orbit is hardly helpful; the plan, at least as I understand it, was to mate them together. That would have involved a lot of extra mating hardware on the ET, and every single pound counted. We were always looking at ways to save weight, even very small amounts. So you would have not only had to carry more propellant into orbit, but a heavier tank as well, which I imagine would not have been very popular with anyone. I have the sense that the OMS fuel payload was about 10000 lbs of monomethyl hydrazine. So even a 25% increase is not an insubstantial amount of weight. Another thought: to mate the tanks up, you have to drop them off in the same orbit, and in fact you'd have to insert to catch them. But your orbital insertion is aimed, most of the time, at the ISS. You can't do both destinations, so do you bring every tank to the ISS with you? Is that safe? The tanks shed a lot of debris, mostly foam and ice. What happens if you park 30 or 40 of them near the ISS? I'm not really sure, but it sounds problematic to me. The tanks are never really empty at main engine cut off; they have unusable residual fuel that starts to vaporize and vent. This is part of the reason the tanks broke up so nicely on reentry, the venting made it tumble. I can see some technical problems associated with this too. In short, I don't have direct expertise on this topic, but based on my understanding I don't think the delta-v associated with getting the tanks into a stable orbit was the primary problem. I think the bigger problems were 1) the performance hit on the redesigned tanks, 2) the logistics of handling a bunch of tanks in orbit, 3) the incompatibility of using the tanks as space stations with the actual space station we were planning to build. I do know that there were a lot of people at Michoud who worked on the tanks for years and were sympathetic to the tank-station plan. A friend had an illustration of it on his desk, which might be how I first heard about it. So I don't want to give the impression that it was a silly or impossible plan. Perhaps I can get a grey beard from earlier in the program to come by and talk about it some time. It's an interesting topic.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I am not positive, but I am ALMOST certain that is exactly right. As the profile of the reentering body changes, slow, rhythmic pulsing is exactly what you would expect to see. In the post-separation video I posted, you can see it starting to tumble within minutes of detachment. That increases when venting starts; it is a feature, not a bug. More tumbling, more dispersement, more burn up, less debris hitting Earth.</TEXT>

Elsewhere in the reporting appears this quote from an NSA document on breaking encryption by compromising encryption software on the developer side: "These design changes make the systems in question exploitable through Sigint collection  #8230; with foreknowledge of the modification. To the consumer **and other adversaries**, however, the systems' security remains intact." [emphasis added] This makes clear that the NSA considers anyone who uses encryption tools as "an adversary" as they use the term, even regular consumers of commercial software like VPN. 2.) As other articles on the NSA have stated, the NSA has reserved the legal right to save ALL encrypted communications at their discretion and keep it until they a) can break it b) lose interest in it. This also supports the concept that anyone using encryption is an NSA adversary, as they use the term.</TEXT>

As Schneier says, strong encryption still works. We are going to see a burst of open-source privacy tools flood the market. Either some measure of privacy will be restored by our creative tech class, or we will enter an era in which everyone's personal life is public and no thought or action can go unmonitored. I think that sounds enormously oppressive and dangerous, but if that's where we go it will be society's choice. At least now society HAS a choice; that's more than the NSA wanted to give us.

    <TEXT>VivaKnievel, let me start by saying that I admit it's unlikely I will change your mind (or you mine) about Pacific Rim. And that's fine. This isn't an argument to win, it's just a discussion about giant robot movies; I find criticism of entertainment fun, so please take this in that light. 2.) I read your links about the history of the Gipsy and the Gipsy II engines of British aviation fame. They are indeed interesting, and I have no doubt that's where del Toro got the name of the Gipsy Danger. He may even have stated as much in interviews. I was unable to determine, from your information, *why* the Gipsy engine was named that. The closest I can come is that other engines of the era were named for moths and butterflies, and there is a "gypsy moth." Which leads me to ask why the "gypsy moth" is called that? It seems like a bit of a dead end; the etymology is lost to history. I did find [this link](http://www.sierrapotomac.org/W_Needham/GypsyMoth_070220.htm) which states the name may have come from the wandering nature of the moth. So, in other words, the Gipsy engine was probably named for the gypsy moth, which was probably named for the wandering people called "gypsies". (This is original research on my part, so please tell me if I'm wrong.) Although this wasn't true when the gipsy engine was used, today "gypsy" is widely considered a racial slur for Roma people to whom it refers, [especially among the Roma](http://golden-zephyr.tumblr.com/post/52786680758/gypsy-is-a-slur-period). So the choice of the name "gipsy danger", even if it has a meaningful etymology outside of racial slurs, cannot really escape the shadow the word has come under, and your information about the engine--while interesting--does not really refute my point. 3) It also states that they stopped building them, which I understood to have some relevance to the fact they were losing them faster than they could build them. It was not stated exactly why they stopped building them, instead of changing their tactics. 4) I am not sure you really understood my criticism here, based on your response. I am not advocating that Chuck go alone. I never said that. What I said was, it is established elsewhere in the movie that pilots can switch sides if one has a hurt arm (because the two main characters switch sides prior to their first drift, and he says this is because of his hurt arm). So we know, in-universe, the injury to Herc need not have prevented him from proceeding to co-pilot with his son: They could have switched sides so the son could control that arm. Also, how do you know Stacker had drift compatibility with Chuck? They never tested it; they just jumped in the jaeger and hoped, at least that's what the movie depicted. Stacker seemed confident, but that was about it. (Side point: If Herc has a broken arm, why was it in a sling instead of a cast? It was being treated like a sprain.) 5) Kaiju blood ("kaiju blue") is described as a dangerous substance in the opening crawl, that can only be handled with hazmat gear. In fact, it's supposed to be so dangerous that killing kaiju with missiles is considered too risky to the environment, which prompts the whole Jaeger program. It is also described as highly toxic and caustic [in the Pacific Rim wiki](http://pacificrim.wikia.com/wiki/Kaiju_Blue). So how did Hannibal survive? 6) Ok, so we agree that the characters were stereotypical and broad. I call it "lazy screenwriting," you call it an "anime homage." Tomato, tomahto. And I dispute the fact that all anime is this way. Hayao Miyazaki's films don't embrace those two-dimensional character types. Cowboy Bebop didn't. Paranoia Agent didn't. I think you're referring more specifically to giant robot anime, which (sadly) does tend to follow broad, stereotypical character designs. But I would argue that even Evangelion had more interesting characters than Pacific Rim did. Do you disagree? 7) Yes, and it's such a common shorthand that it is now [openly mocked](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncurableCoughOfDeath). It is overused in Hollywood generally and it was overused in Pacific Rim specifically. 8) I am not sure how you know that he has a broken arm versus a sprain or lesser injury, but I'll just accept that's true. The fact that Stacker just says "don't worry, we'll drift fine" would not be convincing for me if I was in charge of the mission, given that even well-matched pilots can sometimes freak out, go into shock, and try to destroy the hanger when drifting. But perhaps you have a lower standard for mission protocols (when the survival of the world is at stake) than I do. 9) You might not dismantle buildings that, because of the kaiju menace, are now deathtraps, but I sure wouldn't live in or work in one. The sociology of Hong Kong as presented in the movie is hard to understand or explain, except to make it look awesome. If the outside of a temple was made from gold, you better believe people would steal it. The bones are shown framing people's houses! You don't think there'd be a bit of temptation to chip off a few pounds in the second bathroom to put the kids through college? If kaiju worship is such a big deal that nobody would dare do this, then that needed to be stated in the film. But your point about Chau being from Brooklyn is well taken; I retract that criticism. He probably *would* have used pounds. 10) These were things I noticed *during* the movie. I didn't decide I hated it and then look for things, I watched the movie and decided it was stupid because of the things I saw. "Hated" is too strong of a word. I enjoyed parts of it. Much like Hellboy, I thought it would have been better with the dialog edited out so I could come up with my own plot. It is true that I am picking on dumb things just to pick on them. I mean, why else talk about movies except that we like to talk about movies? That's the fun, right?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>From the [original der Spiegel article](http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/privacy-scandal-nsa-can-spy-on-smart-phone-data-a-920971.html)  gt;The documents also state that the NSA has succeeded in accessing the BlackBerry mail system, which is known to be very secure. This could mark a huge setback for the company, which has always claimed that its mail system is uncrackable. I feel a bit sad for RIM; they've been trying hard to restructure, and this could be a big setback for their business-sensitive clientele.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey, I am a former external tank (shuttle program) propulsion guy. Those are indeed RCS thrusters. All orbiter thruster ports were covered by Tyvek sheaths while the shuttle sat on the pad, to prevent water and other debris from getting in prior to launch. Actually, I am not 100% certain whether those particular ports are covered with Tyvek or butcher paper (I know they stopped using butcher paper on the forward ports, but I am not so sure about the rear ones). --End facts, begin scientific extrapolation-- The RCS system would, to my knowledge, not be used on the pad, so I would assert the reason the covers are ripped open upon main engine start is because the engines create a MASSIVE gas flow into the flame pit beneath the pad; it would be like a hurricane (worse, actually) down there once the engines were at full power. This air acceleration would cause a huge drop in pressure due to Bernoulli's law, so anything that was sealed closed would be ripped open. This is consistent with the way the covers ripple in the wind once they are torn open. I didn't work directly on this system, so this is not a definitive answer, but it is consistent with fluid dynamics and my knowledge of the STS MPS.</TEXT>

The interview in question is [here](http://www.npr.org/2013/09/11/221359323/reporter-had-to-decide-if-snowden-leaks-were-the-real-thing) and the quote from Gellman is:  gt;"Big Brother is a very imperfect analogy. On the one hand ... I see no evidence that the government is assembling these tools in order to spy on political opponents or corruptly to serve some private interest, or things that you worry about with the Big Brother analogy.  gt;"On the other hand, it has accumulated powers that were beyond all imagination of George Orwell  #8212; that dwarfed the surveillance capabilities of Orwell  #8212; and as it has done so  #8212; as it has made the whole world and the U.S. population more and more transparent  #8212; it has become more and more opaque about what it's doing.

    <TEXT>There is plenty of room for disagreement here, and my opinions on this facet of the NSA scandal are not fully developed, so you might well convince me I'm wrong. But here is my thinking: Orwell created a very specific vision in *1984*, of a certain *kind* of dystopia. I'm not a literary critic, but it had some features that I don't think are in dispute, such as ubiquitous surveillance, compulsory membership in a single party, the existence of thought crimes, mandatory nationalism, economic socialism, and a dictatorial charismatic leader (figurehead). What I think of, when I think of the NSA, is not *1984*. It's something closer to the Magician's Apprentice, in which a well-meaning but not particularly clever actor invokes powers he is not mature enough to handle, to create a relentless machine that--predictably--he is powerless to control. If you look at the cases where NSA abuses have been proven or alleged, they are not due to the J. Edgar Hoover-like machinations of some power-mad villain; instead, they are due to small oversights, compromises, and acts of carelessness built into a system far too powerful for any human institution, no matter how well-intended, to shepherd. This is not to assert that the NSA is free of bad actors; I'm sure there are a few (or plenty). I am only asserting that the *characteristic* of the NSA is something more like an out-of-control supertanker headed for the Alaskan coast, and less like the villainous party officers of 1984. Of course, if 1984 had a prequel, it might look very much like the NSA circa 2013. That is another reason these powers are too great to trust to the hands of government: By the time a 1984 comparison is really apt, it will be prohibited by law under threat of torture. Those are my thoughts on the subject. I'm curious to hear your response.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You said the post's title was misleading because the NSA wasn't inserting moles. But the article in fact says  gt;To conduct those types of operations, the NSA works together with other intelligence agencies such as the CIA and FBI, which in turn maintain informants on location who are available to help with sensitive missions. So they HAVE planted permanent moles in the organizations. You were drawing a contrast to a "much more sinister" operation that you thought was a hyperbolic example of something that *doesn't* happen, but in fact it *already happens*. Thus, to attempt to correct the misinformation you were spreading, I posted  gt;if you read the full TAO article, it says the NSA uses FBI and CIA moles inside tech companies to implant some of their bugs. I was trying to draw your attention to this serious failure of your attempted analogy. But you either didn't see or didn't care about my correction, and the debate moved on as if your comment was correct, instead of exactly the opposite of reality... which is, frankly, a common feature of my discussions about the NSA with apologists like yourself ("It's just what they DO. Playa gonna play. Hate the GAME.") When I say they're tapping everyone's phones, apologists say it's legal because of FISA. When FISA judgements get declassified saying the court found programs to be unlawful, apologists say there were no intentional abuses. When examples of intentional abuses are put forward, apologists just say these were sporadic. And so on and so on. In your case, you actually constructed an apologia ("hey, they're not planting moles or anything") that was *already specifically factually rejected* in the current article! But instead of correcting the record, you just left the scene, which I consider disingenuous: arguing in bad faith. But perhaps you just missed my comment, or didn't read the entire article linked here before you opined about how blameless the NSA was, in which case you can either admit your analogy was wrong and the NSA is "more sinister" than you had realized, or you can do the apologist thing, pretend you didn't say what you said, and move the goalposts.

    <TEXT>First, I want to apologize for my tone. It was harsher than necessary, and your response was more polite than I deserved. I think we are coming closer to agreeing on the facts alleged in the article, and perhaps with a little more work, we can get all the way there. Here is the full context of the quote I previously posted:  gt;But numerous internal announcements of successful attacks like the one against the undersea cable operator aren't the exclusive factors that make TAO stand out at the NSA. In contrast to most NSA operations, TAO's ventures often require physical access to their targets. After all, you might have to directly access a mobile network transmission station before you can begin tapping the digital information it provides.  gt;Spying Traditions Live On  gt;To conduct those types of operations, the NSA works together with other intelligence agencies such as the CIA and FBI, which in turn maintain informants on location who are available to help with sensitive missions. This enables TAO to attack even isolated networks that aren't connected to the Internet. If necessary, the FBI can even make an agency-owned jet available to ferry the high-tech plumbers to their target. This gets them to their destination at the right time and can help them to disappear again undetected after as little as a half hour's work. Here are my takeaways from that passage: 1. The NSA, in conjunction with the FBI and CIA, do employ "moles". I never asserted, in this context, that the companies were "in cahoots" with the government; that's the whole point of using "moles": secretly compromised employees who can be used to execute spy schemes. Right? Of course, we DO know that the larger internet companies ARE in "cahoots" with the government, for example via the PRISM program that automated access requests, which the companies complied with and kept secret, and via payments to at least some companies (we know of RSA) to use substandard encryption. But that's not what is being alleged here. 2. "Bugs ARE being planted." The technicians are being ferried in by their moles in order to plant bugs, both physical ones and software-based ones. These bugs are specifically designed to resist updates to firmware. The article references bugs planted directly into BIOS, or into USB cables themselves, and other hardware hacks. I have no idea why you keep trying to dodge around and deflect the accusations in the article, which are very specific and quite serious. You say you're not an apologist, but I will reiterate that moving the goalposts is the quintessential apologist tactic. 3. This should be obvious, but just to clearly state it: The targets in this article are not Iranians, or North Koreans, or terrorists. They are companies and networks in the US or in friendly nations. The NSA's goal is not to "stop terrorism"; it is to "collect it all" and give other partnered agencies whatever they want. Whether terrorism is foiled, as a policy goal, *doesn't matter to the NSA*. What matters is whether they can hack anything and everything. And that distinction is clear from the work they actually do. You say you were too busy to respond to my correction of your factually-wrong assertion. On the one hand, I'm very sympathetic to that. I'm a busy person too, and responding to the Internet can become a full time job. On the other hand, one reason "the American people dropped their guard" as you aptly put it, is because they get a LOT of misinformation that leads them to believe that everything is fine, nothing is the matter, and they can go back to sleep. Not to put too fine a point on it: When the chatter on Reddit is filled with misinformation like "the NSA isn't planting bugs" when the article is directly claiming that "the NSA is planting bugs", that makes the debate weaker, makes the public less informed, and makes the outcomes you say you want less likely to happen. We're all busy, but you apparently had time to post misinformation that diluted the facts and distracted readers. Your post was at +16, and my correction was at 0, so what are readers going to come away thinking? Pardon me for generalizing, but this is the NSA debate in a microcosm: NSA critics identify something dangerous or illegal that the NSA is doing, the NSA defenders issue a non-denial denial or a factually-incorrect defense, and some percentage of the population buys the lie and goes back to sleep. Rinse/repeat. Again, I'm not trying to put the entire burden of NSA apologists on you, but whether you mean to be or not, you are working out of their playbook. Finally, let's look at the larger point you offered at the conclusion of your response:  gt;I think there's a huge problem here. I don't think panicking and blowing up issues that aren't vetted helps the situation. I think we need to focus on the fundamental problem of how we got to this point in the first place -- the American people dropped their guard and basically requested it by allowing their leaders to craft such laws and reelecting them. First, I reject the characterization of the national debate as "panicked". I will admit, I am *angry* about what the national security state has been doing in secret. But I don't see anything on the national stage that could fairly be described as panic. If anything, I would say that passing the PATRIOT Act and giving the NSA carte blanche to destroy all human privacy was the moment when the nation was "panicked." Criticism of the NSA is a return to rationality. Second, I would ask what you mean by "issues that aren't vetted"? Vetted by whom? Obama? Clapper? Alexander? Have these leaders done anything to prove they are reasonable stewards of the redacting marker? Trusting others to filter the truth is how we got into this mess, isn't it? But perhaps I am misunderstanding your point here. Again, thanks for the civil reply. I hope we can continue this discussion.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You sound like a whistleblower. But I don't quite understand your conclusion. This wasn't Booze Allen (the IT firm that employed Snowden) fudging qualifications to get candidates into positions. This is USIS, the company contracted to conduct background checks, submitting reports to the government that were never properly investigated. Are you saying that those firms routinely dump unqualified people onto the government to get a quick paycheck? If you have information to that effect (proving widespread fraud), are you afraid to come forward with it? And if that is true, then is there any reason to think employees at the NSA and CIA aren't spies, or stalkers, or worse? I mean, any more or less than the general population? EDIT: In case it isn't clear from context, "whistleblower" is a compliment, not an indictment. Sign of the times, I guess.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>sorry to be curt, but i don't think you are very good at reading. the study was by the PCLOB. here is the reasoning, which the article quoted in full. go back and try, you know, thinking before you type something. thanks, dickwhiskey. "First, the telephone records acquired under the program have no connection to any specific FBI investigation at the time of their collection. Second, because the records are collected in bulk  #8212; potentially encompassing all telephone calling records across the nation  #8212; they cannot be regarded as  #8220;relevant #8221; to any FBI investigation as required by the statute without redefining the word relevant in a manner that is circular, unlimited in scope, and out of step with the case law from analogous legal contexts involving the production of records. Third, the program operates by putting telephone companies under an obligation to furnish new calling records on a daily basis as they are generated (instead of turning over records already in their possession)  #8212; an approach lacking foundation in the statute and one that is inconsistent with FISA as a whole. Fourth, the statute permits only the FBI to obtain items for use in its investigations; it does not authorize the NSA to collect anything."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>With alarmist articles like this, I always judge how long it takes for the author to overstate his own stated facts. In this case, it took two paragraphs:  gt;Two years ago food blogger Vani Hari started researching Subway #8217;s bread ingredients and discovered that one was a chemical used in yoga mats.  gt;Hari didn #8217;t feel great about all those people eating plastic. "Ingredient used in yoga mats"  #8800; "plastic". Sarah Laskow/Grist: If you can't figure out how to make a rational, self-consistent argument about food additives, then please let more sober outlets handle these debates. I don't know if azodicarbonamide is dangerous or not, but I can tell I'm not going to figure this issue out reading articles like this one. I did take a look at the [WHO's report on this substance](http://www.who.int/ipcs/publications/cicad/en/cicad16.pdf), which by my reading says that people who *handle the chemical in factories* may experience increased respiratory sensitivity. But those exposure levels are so much higher than the ones mandated for use as a food additive that I wonder whether any strong conclusions can be drawn.</TEXT>

They attempted to use the metadata to draw conclusions about users' lives, and confirm these either by phone interviews or by looking at the users' social media. In the authors' words:  gt;At the outset of this study, we shared the same hypothesis as our computer science colleagues #8212;we thought phone metadata could be very sensitive. We did not anticipate finding much evidence one way or the other, however, since the MetaPhone participant population is small and participants only provide a few months of phone activity on average.  gt;We were wrong.

We were able to infer medical conditions, firearm ownership, and more, using solely phone metadata.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If r/technology posted this list with the sub rules and were above-board about it, I would disagree with their choice of censorship but I'd accept it under the theory of "their sub, their rules." But enacting a large-scale censorship agenda opaquely is absolutely horrible management and should be *severely* punished. Subs that do things like this are essentially being disingenuous with their posted rules and should absolutely not be allowed on the default list. If I have a tech-related topic, how on earth am I supposed to know if the mods consider it "too popular" or "too soapboxy" or whatever the hell their criteria when drawing up this list was? If a moderator team will not allow discussions of SOPA or the NSA on a tech site (even though these are easily two of the most critical tech issues in the past 10 years), then it needs to say that up front so people aren't wasting their time. Is a little honesty and transparency unreasonable? EDIT: This comment was probably not worthy of gold. I shall now pay my unearned good fortune forward by buying gold for the highest rated comment on the most obscure subreddit I subscribe to... which I think is /r/youtubeexplorers. Thanks, though! Seriously!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>your thinking here is flawed. a public list of banned topics is an absolute requirement on a message board. The exact keyword list could be private (example: 'NO obscenity allowed" ; unpublished keyword list: shit, sh1t, shite... etc). Attempting to circumvent the filter (post "this is bullish.it") would and should merit a ban, and if the topic filter is legit the community ITSELF will bring the down vote hammer on violators. And if the banned topic list is NOT legit (ahem, NSA), then users will leave and go to a different subreddit. Like adults.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Let me take your points in order.  gt;Like how they accepted the Tesla ban by just posting Tesla stories over and over until there is nothing but Tesla? I am not sure what point you are trying to make here. The story (as I understand it) is: a) /technology bans Tesla stories without telling anyone; b) someone figures it out and tells the Front Page; c) /technology looks bad and cancels the ban; d) as of today there are three Tesla stories on /technology this week. So undoing the blanket ban didn't have any dire repercussions. What is your point exactly? Perhaps I'm misunderstanding you.  gt;Have you ever seen what happened in /r/atheism? The mods made some unpopular rule changes and then people spammed the subreddit until it was filled with only complaints and no content. These people were actively downvoting content and being disruptive on innocent posts, just out of spite. Being disruptive is a violation of subreddit rules; it can (and should) result in a ban. That's already against the rules so I don't know what to say about that except that rules against disruption are just and no one is arguing against that. If your point is that subreddits that make unpopular decisions have to deal with angry Redditors, then yes, that's true, and that's a good thing. Social unrest is an impetus to change; that's a feature not a bug. In any event, /r/atheism is still alive and kicking, its front page today is populated with good articles, and I don't see any signs of chaos or disruption, so again, I am not sure how your cautionary tale is to be interpreted.  gt;I can assure you, if they would post the list up front, nobody would accept it and the subreddit would grind to a halt. When a subreddit screws up (and I would argue that /r/technology's shadow censor list is a **bad policy**), then it SHOULD grind to a halt until the bad policies are a) fixed or b) defended and reaffirmed. If the reaffirming of a bad policy leads to an exodus or the removal of /r/technology from the default list, then, again, that's a feature, not a bug. But it starts by clearly *stating the policy*. How can a subreddit survive that won't explain what you're allowed to post about?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I strongly respect where you're coming from, but reading your comments, you have as your unstated major premise the idea that protecting the community of a sub from hectic, polarizing discussions is somehow the moderation mission, more important than clearly communicating your rules, more important than explaining your moderation practices, and more important than the expectations and feelings of submitters who get their items and posts deleted. I may be missing something, but that appears to be your working assumption (if you'd like to correct me or clarify, please do). I think that's where the biggest disagreement exists on these topics right now. I *totally* understand why a moderator of /bestof or /technology might not want to continuously see posts about Tesla, or the NSA, or /undelete, or whatever. And they might, for various reasons, want to take action to protect their community from these (dangerous? upsetting? annoying? help me understand) topics. But the solution to that is not to create secret rules and opaque judgements that are applied unevenly and according to obscure criteria. The solution, it seems to me, is posting clear, unambiguous guidance and moderating to it aggressively (/askhistorians is a good example of this). If a subreddit explicitly says "we will never allow /undelete comments onto /bestof because we think /undelete readers are a bunch of conspiratorial lunatics," well, I might find that closed-minded and counterproductive but at least it's a *position* that can be debated, refuted, or used as a basis for a swift unsubscribe. Imposing a rule like that in secret, in contrast, merely increases the hostility, distrust, paranoia, and feelings of persecution that are, essentially, the problem Reddit had to begin with and which are why /undelete was created. And keeping such rules secret doesn't solve any problems, it only exacerbates them while kicking the resolution down the road. The final result, it seems to me, is a site where the "persecuted" (i.e. censored) minority splinters off and moves into an echo chamber where they can congratulate themselves on having been victimized, while the majority happily proceed in a world where certain difficult topics are simply "disappeared" away, for their own protection (I guess?). Is either group well served by such an outcome? Final point: I can't say with confidence whether moderators have been bought out by nefarious and manipulative powers. I used to be less paranoid about such things, but we now have clear documents (that cannot be discussed in /news or /technology) that unambiguously say that intelligence organizations use sites like Facebook and YouTube to spread ["propaganda, deception, mass messaging, pushing stories, alias development, and psychology."](https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/04/04/cuban-twitter-scam-social-media-tool-disseminating-government-propaganda/) So one is simply required by the facts to entertain these theories. I wish it weren't so, but if being called an government shill makes a moderator uncomfortable, they should take it up with the person who wrote those slides explaining how the government planned to use the Internet to plant shills. I mean, *you have to admit*, if the NSA DIDN'T have anything to do with the banning of NSA stories on /r/news, they sure must feel lucky to have accomplished such a victory without even getting their hands dirty. Again, that's not a direct accusation against any group of moderators, it's just a statement of the current situation. And it's not one well suited to building trust. Edit: It's easier to proofread in the edit window than the post window because the post window is too small for tldr bait like this.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's fine, it was an honest mistake. I read your entire post and I don't think I saw anything I could disagree with. I fully concur that the spirit and context of /TIL is (and *should be*) totally apolitical. Again, I've never really engaged with /TIL and I have no contact with the rules, but it sounds like they follow the "give clear guidance; moderate aggressively" approach that I myself favor. Let me use this point of agreement to draw a few distinctions against /technology's approach. First off, it's well and good to say that political content is to be avoided/banned/shunned whatever. And when a subreddit has a field of interest that is entirely insulated from current events, that is a realistic and laudable goal. But /r/technology does **not** take this view. Their very first rule is "Posts should be on technology (news, updates, *political policy*, etc)." (emphasis added) So they directly **invite** political submissions, as long as that political policy involves technology. Trying to filter out SOPA and NSA stories when your **very first rule** invites political tech stories is disingenuous at best. Actually, I'll go further: *it is inexplicably nuts.* You can invite policy discussions about tech, or you can ban discussions of important tech laws and important tech policies. Doing *both* creates controversy and confusion. Doing both *secretly* creates paranoia. And paranoid controversial confusion creates strife, malcontents and subs like /undelete. This all seems very straightforward to me. I'm sorry to hear that /TIL gets hassled on this sub. I have seen a few examples of that and they all seemed undeserved to me--all the deleted TIL subs I've read here, while legitimately interesting, were *clearly* trying to create a political shit show. I'm a fan of political shit shows, but they're not for every sub. Last point. I read u/honestbleeps response to the accusation of corporate buyouts, and I am absolutely sure he is being completely honest about his experiences. But let's look at what he actually says: 1. He HAS been approached with money to place content. He says he declined. If it has happened once, it has happened many, many times. 2. He has seen no evidence that other moderators are taking money to promote or ban topics. But absence of evidence isn't evidence of absence. 3. He's been frequently approached by organizations who want to capitalize on controlling visibility in a subreddit (he mentions offers to be named official sponsors or some such), but so far they don't "even attempt to make it worth our while." So he admits that various groups recognize that controlling a big subreddit is a valuable commodity, and that he and his peers have been unimpressed at the dollar value of these efforts, thus far. This is hardly a resounding rejection of the very notion of corruption in a subreddit. It actually sounds like the sort of environment where, without any mechanisms for transparency or accountability, a corrupt actor could thrive. Now let's go back to [the article I referenced in my post](https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/04/04/cuban-twitter-scam-social-media-tool-disseminating-government-propaganda/). That article was by Glenn Greenwald, the Guardian journalist who just won a Polk and a Pulitzer for his reporting on the NSA. This is the quintessential knowledgeable source. The article is about a recently exposed, futile attempt by USAID to monitor and encourage political dissidents in Cuba using a ridiculous Twitter clone. That plan was laughable. Greenwald says that this is just "a drop in the bucket" and backs up this claim by posting **actual NSA documents** where NSA operatives brag about using Twitter, Facebook, Flickr, and YouTube to promote propaganda and information operations.  gt;The document was presented by GCHQ #8217;s Joint Threat Research Intelligence Group (JTRIG). The unit #8217;s self-described purpose is  #8220;using online techniques to make something happen in the real or cyber world, #8221; including  #8220;information ops (influence or disruption). #8221; The British agency describes its JTRIG and Computer Network Exploitation operations as a  #8220;major part of business #8221; at GCHQ, conducting  #8220;5% of Operations. #8221; Relic2279, I am **telling** you, not theorizing, guessing, or exaggerating, that large intelligence agencies are actively trying to control social media sites. Read the slides:  gt;Information Operations: The Social Web -- Deliver messages and multimedia content across Web 2.0; Crafting messaging campaigns to go "viral" They are spending huge sums of money, introducing human engineering agents, and focusing great resources and attention to manipulate the content of websites like this one to pursue their ends. I wish that weren't true. It **IS** laughable, just like the USAID fake Twitter plot was laughable. In my opinion, much of what the government does is laughable. It is also, bizarrely, real. EDIT: I proofread large comments in the edit window. It's easier.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've been following this project for several years (I'm a mechanical engineer with a physics background and a life-long interest in high energy physics), and I can say that from all of my reading, they are absolutely legitimate. That doesn't mean they are guaranteed to succeed (fusion is ridiculously hard), nor does it necessarily mean that their approach is the best one (nations are funding ITER for a reason), but their mission, their approach, and their scientific rigor have been basically consistent since at least 2004, when I became aware of them. Their project has always struck me as a quintessential low-risk/high-reward endeavor. Their methods are cheap, the systems they are building are fundamentally safe, and if the device works, the world will be revolutionized. If it doesn't work, the total cost will be about equivalent to one failed NBC sitcom pilot. That's definitely worth 50 bucks from me, but your results may vary. Anyone claiming that this is a scam or some sort of cold-fusion perpetual motion device is misinformed, and I'm sorry to see so much hostility directed to a group of people who are basically just doing their best to create a technology that could, conceivably at least, benefit our entire planet. But skepticism, however hostile, is not inappropriate. It's unfortunate that poorly-thought-out projects like the idiotic Solar Roadway have (rightfully?) engendered so much cynicism towards crowd-sourced projects, but all "change the world" schemes are not created equal and some really are worthy of our support. I think this is one of them. That being said, when I read through all their Indie-Gogo materials, I was disappointed to see that they made a LOT of grand claims about their technology. I guess that's just par for the sensationalist course where crowd funding is concerned, but they kept talking about their power generation devices as if they were just around the corner and practically a sure thing ("Focus Fusions generators *will* be 5MW units", "aneutronic fusion *will* enable trips to Mars"). The fact is, I wouldn't put their chances at success over the next five years much past 5%. But hey, for a small investment of a few million dollars, a 5% chance at technology that could a) halt global warming, b) eliminate combustion pollution, c) cause a massive world-wide economic boom, and d) sure, save me $70 a month on my power bill forever, is actually a pretty good investment. If this sort of thing interests you, I would check out their website... but not their CURRENT website, which is tricked out with the impossible promises of an intense IndieGoGo campaign. Go to their OLD website, for example [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20120111143248/http://focusfusion.org/) (via the WayBackMachine), where you can see their regular, run of the mill experimental updates... and a quaint, mundane Paypal "donate" button.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Insect-borne disease agents that have the ability to be transferred from one individual to the next via contaminated mouthparts must circulate at very high levels in the bloodstream of their host. Transfer by mouthpart contamination requires sufficient infectious particles to initiate a new infection. The exact number of infectious particles varies from one disease to the next. HIV circulates at very low levels in the blood--well below the levels of any of the known mosquito-borne diseases. Infected individuals rarely circulate more that 10 units of HIV, and 70 to 80% of HIV-infected persons have undetectable levels of virus particles in their blood. Calculations with mosquitoes and HIV show that a mosquito that is interrupted while feeding on an HIV carrier circulating 1000 units of HIV has a 1:10 million probability of injecting a single unit of HIV to an AIDS-free recipient. In laymen's terms, an AIDS-free individual would have to be bitten by 10 million mosquitoes that had begun feeding on an AIDS carrier to receive a single unit of HIV from contaminated mosquito mouthparts. Using the same calculations, crushing a fully engorged mosquito containing AIDS positive blood would still not begin to approach the levels needed to initiate infection. In short, mechanical transmission of AIDS by HIV-contaminated mosquitoes appears to be well beyond the limits of probability. Therefore, none of the theoretical mechanisms cited earlier appear to be possible for mosquito transmission of HIV. (from your link) This would seem to make transmission by needle sharing very unlikely also. Is there a reason needles are a probable infection vector even though HIV blood circulation is very low? If smearing a mosquito's worth of HIV infected blood on an open wound is not dangerous, how many people actually get infected by sharing a needle?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Your argument may have been submitted in good faith, but it's riddled with inconsistencies and factual inaccuracies. "...he still violated his oath". Snowden's oath was to defend the constitution. Nothing in the text of that oath forbade any of his actions in principle or specifically. Moreover, none of the charges he actually faces are related to "breaking his oath", so your point is not only factually baseless, it is also irrelevant. See [here](http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/closeread/2014/01/did-edward-snowden-break-his-oath.html)  gt;Snowden told the Washington Post #8217;s Barton Gellman that the document he signed, as what Kaplan calls  #8220;a condition of his employment, #8221; was Standard Form 312, a contract in which the signatory says he will  #8220;accept #8221; the terms, rather than swearing to them. By signing it, Snowden agreed that he was aware that there were federal laws against disclosing classified information. But the penalties for violating agreement alone are civil: for example, the government can go after any book royalties he might get for publishing secrets. In short, your very first sentence promulgates a deep misunderstanding of both NSA employment and relevant federal law. Not a promising start. "If I murdered a serial killer, I saved peoples' lives ... but I still murdered someone, and I would still be prosecuted." That's really a poor comparison, but let's play it out. If you "murder" a serial killer because you fear for your own life, you can argue self defense. If you murder a serial killer in rage after stumbling on the scene of the crime, you can make several arguments based on your psychological state that may reduce the crime from premeditated murder to a lesser offense or even having the charges dropped. The equivalent of doing this in Snowden's case would be making a whistleblower defense: "I did leak the documents, but I did it to reveal wrongdoing after internal avenues had failed." Except Espionage Act trials *don't allow a whistleblower defense*. In other words, in a Snowden trial, the court would only admit the following part of the above sentence: "I did leak the documents." The End. Read more about deep flaws in the admissability of espionage act defenses [here](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/28/snowden-return-us-kerry-face-charges-espionage); the relevant quote from Ben Wizner, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union, is this:  gt; #8220;The laws would not provide him any opportunity to say that the information never should have been withheld from the public in the first place. And the fact that the disclosures have led to the highest journalism rewards, have led to historic reforms in the US and around the world  #8211; all of that would be irrelevant in a prosecution under the espionage laws in the United States. #8221; "The law is the law. As someone that had top secret security clearance, you can't just go and leak things because YOU think you should ... even you turn out to be right, it's not your call." Are you actually arguing that no whistleblowers should **ever** come forward, even if they are right? Is that the world you actually want to live in? Everyone follows orders, right or wrong? "If he faces the music, stands up for what he did, and maintains that he did what he felt was right despite what the government does to him, I will have immense respect for him ... but I don't see that happening." You're absolutely right it won't happen; see "Espionage Act" above. "As much as it bothers me what the government was doing, they had a legal basis to do it." They *claim* a legal basis, but in fact numerous reviews have found that broad portions of the programs Snowden revealed were, in fact, illegal. Your premise, in other words, begs the question: "What the NSA did was legal, because they SAID it was!" It's obvious to *me* that what the NSA was doing was highly illegal, but don't take my word for it. Listen to the [Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, which Congress made an independent agency in 2007](https://www.google.com/search?q=NSA+legal+or+illegal amp;rlz=1C1OPRB_enUS541US541 amp;oq=NSA+legal+or+illegal amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.4488j0j4 amp;sourceid=chrome amp;es_sm=93 amp;ie=UTF-8). Or listen to the [George W. Bush-appointed federal judge](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/17/us/politics/federal-judge-rules-against-nsa-phone-data-program.html?pagewanted=all) who is currently reviewing the programs:  gt; #8220;I cannot imagine a more  #8216;indiscriminate #8217; and  #8216;arbitrary #8217; invasion than this systematic and high-tech collection and retention of personal data on virtually every single citizen for purposes of querying and analyzing it without prior judicial approval, #8221; Judge Leon wrote in a 68-page ruling.  #8220;Surely, such a program infringes on  #8216;that degree of privacy #8217; that the founders enshrined in the Fourth Amendment, #8221; which prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures. In short, the parts of your argument that make factual claims are in error. The parts of your argument that make emotional claims are hard to defend when looked at frankly. And your larger point, that "the law is the law"? I'll just point out that President Obama is legally required to investigate and prosecute any accusations of torture against the US government, according to a treaty signed by Reagan. He hasn't ("look forward, not back"). So he's in violation of the law. Should he be in jail? Some people seem to be so avid in their pursuit of lawbreaking until they're asked to apply the same standards to those in power, when suddenly they fall mute. As Conor Friedersdorf wrote in The Atlantic last week:  gt;Can he point me to his righteous calls for Bush and Obama administration officials who have violated the law in the course of the War on Terrorism #8212;and there are many #8212;to be held legally accountable? Could he give me a list of the Bush and Obama administration officials that he'd like to see prosecuted and jailed for their lawbreaking? So, timfitz42, can you? *edit: formatting</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Are you saying that without a top-secret clearance, I can't even DISCUSS this issue? I have 200-page reports by people like Richard Clarke who had access to whatever secret documents they wanted. I have the primary documents Snowden released. I have reams of analysis by lawyers up and down the political spectrum. I have denunciations from senators who are on the oversight boards that govern these programs. But I can't discuss it on Reddit without my own top secret clearance? That's pretty silly. In any event, yes, for several years I DID have a security clearance with full background checks when I worked for NASA, but that gave me absolutely no insight into the NSA. As you must know, when you get a security clearance, they *don't* hook you into some gigantic database such that you're suddenly allowed to research and debate CIA actions in Cuba and Russian incursions into Crimea. You just get to log onto special NASA computer farms or whatever your clearance was in reference to. So once again, your point is misguided in more ways than one.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You don't sound like a jerk, you sound like someone who lives in a fantasy world where "reporting up the chain of command" actually brings about reforms to deeply improper programs. First off, we civilians know plenty about "the details of a position like that". We know it from listening to both former officials like Ray McGovern, and from current and former whistleblowers like Binney, Drake, and of course Daniel Ellsberg. The overwhelming consensus is that when you "take it up the chain of command", you are ignored if you are *lucky*, and your career is totally destroyed and you're prosecuted if you're unlucky. I can provide references on request, or you can just google around for a few minutes. You keep saying I don't know what I'm talking about, when I'm posting extensively quoted references, formal reports, legal findings, and expert analysis. You respond to these **facts** with absolutely nothing, except the vague assertion that, if I really want to be knowledgeable, I should go and join the NSA, get a full top secret security clearance, spend a few years following orders, and then, maybe THEN, I could comment on this. Of course, you'd also argue that once I was in that position, with full knowledge and clearance, I **shouldn't** comment on this, whether I was right or wrong! Quite a clever Catch-22! So your argument, in a nutshell, is "shut up shut up shut up." If I had issues with NASA, I'm sure I would have taken them up the chain, especially if they involved lawbreaking. And if the chain didn't respond, I'd have called the police. I think that's a pretty reasonable response. In any event, you are AGAIN walking askance from the truth, because Snowden says he repeatedly tried to take his concerns up the chain of command and was rebuffed. Are you directly asserting that this is a lie? If it is later proved that he did try to report these issues internally, would you retract those portions of your argument that I have not already demonstrated to be factually false?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ok, let's engage on this hypothetical. Let's say you really found a systematic maintenance flow that endangered pilots, and you really did report it up and down the chain of command, doing everything right. What would really happen? We *know* the answer to that, because this already happened.  gt;McCarty is a soft-spoken Southern man who wouldn #8217;t typically be pegged as the type to make waves. He spent 33 years in the military, 31 as a technician. He rose to the rank of a master sergeant in the Mississippi State Air National Guard #8217;s 186th Air Refueling Wing at Key Field, near Meridian, Mississippi. He worked on KC-135 refueling jets.  gt;However, his decades of service came to an ignoble end. He was denied re-enlistment as a guardsman in February 2006, meaning his career in the National Guard was over. Although his retirement was not until a month later, he was placed on administrative leave and told to not report back to work. Then, he was met by  #8220;two security force members who escorted him to his work center to clear his personnel items and then off of the base, #8221; according to an Air Force IG report of investigation (the investigation by the Air Force IG was sparked by McCarty #8217;s claim that he was retaliated against). The full story of how McCarty's career was destroyed for trying to take legitimate concerns about aircraft maintenance "up the chain of command" is [here](http://nation.time.com/2011/10/20/why-military-whistleblowers-fear-reprisal/).

    <TEXT>Saying the information that distinguishes an individual could fit on a floppy is badly wrong. 1. your body contains an enormous ecosystem of microflora, with ludicrous diversity. Fail to reproduce that, and you fail to reproduce the healthy individual. 2. even a newborn would have an immune system intensively programmed by encounters with stimuli and pathogens, which would not be recorded in the genome. 3. a genetic code is not sufficient to reproduce an individual without full capture of the epigenetic environment in which it was written and read. It would be a floppy that would play differently in every single computer on earth. So the corresponding computer would also have to be captured. 4. Memories are not stored genetically. Nor are any other physical developments post conception. One twin joins the army, becomes mr universe body builder. Other memorizes all Shakespeare, weighs 120 lbs. None of that info is floppy-sized. this may seem nit-picky, but if entire point of video is about information density, they should get at least the broad details right. also, is it true that a binary digit is the smallest unit of information? It seems like this depends on the strata of storage. A single photon could signal yes/no, as could an enormous billboard. Are we to believe the two contain equal information? This is really a question about entropy and information density. I don't know the right answer, but I think it is more profound than was described here.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes, exactly. That's what I meant when I said "1 bit" isn't really a data set, at least not from a physics point of view. A bit could be expressed at many levels of compression, and I think the imprecise language in the video confused the point. Perhaps they will go into these questions in more detail later in the series, but my first impression was that they made the concept less, not more, clear. Of course, that was something of an ancillary point to the main one I was making about the amount of information contained in an individual, but from what I know about quantum mechanics, I am not certain whether science has isolated the truly "smallest" parcel of information. For example, if quantum bits exist, does the binary digit of traditional computer science still represent the smallest unit of information? Can more compression be sneaked into a single elementary particle than a yes/no answer? Perhaps someone with an information theory area of expertise and speak to that point.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>From your source, I don't see anything that asserts that all of a human's memory can fit on a floppy. In fact, it seems to argue the opposite, that the many levels, layers, and interactions of a human "memory bank" are enormously complex and would require a great deal of data and granularity to reproduce. See this passage, from the conclusion:  gt;Unfortunately, relating such measurements to memory requirements might be difficult because of the complex relationship between prior experience and current behavior. The behaviors effected by a previous experience are orders of magnitude richer than mere recognition of an identical stimulus layout at a later date. Genuinely cognitive memory is more than information preservation; information must be transformed, stored, and recalled in such a way that the goals the organism is pursuing are achieved more often or at lower cost. The actions in which a memory of an experience might be in some way manifest are very difficult to identify precisely, and it seems likely that a significant experience would influence a very large number of future actions. This fundamental fact makes estimates based on measuring  #8220;information transferred from input to output #8221; extraordinarily difficult, thereby reducing the utility of any attempt like Landauer #8217;s. Since they are critiquing this other paper by Landauer, I don't see where they actually offer their own estimate of human memory data capacity, but they do mention Landauer's:  gt;Landauer #8217;s guess of 10^12-10^14 synapses each storing 2-10 bits yields an upper bound of 10^15 or so memory elements. This estimate is sufficient for excluding theories that are very computationally inefficient, for example, the one described in the previous paragraph. On the other hand, 10^15 bits is so much memory that it does not provide very specific constraints on any current theory of memory. Certainly, Landauer #8217;s estimate does not provide a plausible new upper bound of the bits available to implement a human-like memory. I read that (I could be wrong) as saying 10^15 bits (about 125 GB) is probably too much memory for a human brain to retain, but whatever the actual number is, it depends more how it is organized than how much of it there is. This goes back to what I said about epigenetics (I think you agree with this part, per your third line): You could transcribe my entire genome, but you'd have no idea how to organize the neuron-building instructions in a new brain to actually form memories that are anything like mine, even if you "wrote out" the state of each of my neurons first on a big hard drive. You'd have to write out the state of each neuron cell, the position, the connections, all of which formed as part of creating the memory. It's a finite problem, but it wouldn't fit on a floppy drive.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A few points. 1. You can't look at this in a vacuum. It's not like minority residents are usually treated great by police, but this one aberrant shooting sent the locals into an inexplicable tizzy and "thank goodness the police swept in and restored order". The Michael Brown shooting was part of a larger trend of harassment and disproportionate police action, both in Ferguson and elsewhere. This has been reported on. It's also mentioned in the linked article. 2. The looting and rioting you mentioned as justifying the police presence was not a direct result ONLY of the shooting. It was also a manifestation of frustration that police were obfuscating the incident. Several police claims have been directly contradicted by witnesses. That sort of thing inflames passions. 3. Ok, take it as stipulated that the rioting and looting, regardless of context and motive, were really bad and required an overwhelming police response. Does that require tanks, machine guns, grenade launchers, and other military accouterments? Is it more likely such battlefield weapons and tactics will defuse the situation and restore order, or further increase tensions? Even if the violence is forcibly suppressed, will that actually solve the problems, or just delay an even bigger problem? 4. Even if we stipulate all of the above, AND stipulate that putting down the rioters with full military battle gear was totally correct, justified, and will work out for the best short-term AND long-term, that does not AT ALL justify the police action against non-violent protesters and journalists, which has been well documented in numerous venues. So, in short, the counterargument is not strong.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The unstated premises of your argument are 1.) that the looting and rioting would have continued or increased absent the police crackdown. That really depends on what caused the riot. If it was sparked by a particular incident or individual, or the absence of calming peaceful protest factions, or just freak chance, then the subsequent police presence didn't prevent the riot, it just happened after it. I am not making a strong argument against your point, but I am pointing out that you don't seem to even question the possibility that the police presence had nothing to do with whether a particular night of protests erupted into riots. There could be numerous other plausible factors. If a subsequent night of protests erupts into riots, despite the presence of police, I hope you'll take the opportunity to recognize your erroneous logic. 2.) Assuming the beat cop shooting Michael Brown was separate from Greenwald's postulated militarized police. Stop and frisk, the war on drugs, the disproportionate targeting of minorities, and other social trends that led to a beat cop detaining an unarmed, non-criminal kid walking to his grandma's and (eventually for some reason) fighting with him and (eventually for some reason) shooting him in the back is, in fact, part of the culture of militarization and citizen-targeting that Greenwald is attacking. Both of these premises are defensible, I guess, but to take them as an assumed part of your argument is dangerous. In response to your larger point, should Greenwald have mentioned the rioting explicitly? He describes the police as a response to "protests"; he's certainly focused on the police response. I don't know if I'd call it "disingenuous." As to your factual assertion as to whether the first day was more violent than subsequent, I already said I don't have facts to accept or reject that. You've reasserted it, but can you explain your sources and reasoning? I am not at all denying this claim, I just want to understand where it comes from.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm certainly willing to grant that the police have done a good job in preventing additional deaths... so far. I frankly think that with their current tactics, escalation is probable and more deaths are a very real possibility. But I'd like to be proven wrong about this. Part of the onus is, of course, on the locals who are organizing and participating in the protests: they have an obligation to remain non-violent. But I also recognize that some of the police actions described today in the Washington Post reporter's account would probably inspire otherwise non-violent people to become angry enough to lash out. Again, the question is not whether police tactics are effective in squashing a protest or clearing out a McDonalds or preventing a riot. The question is, will the protest come back more violently tomorrow as a result of today's actions? It seems a bit early to be assigning grades to anyone here; things could still be resolved usefully, or could still spiral out of control.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>From that same column:  gt;UPDATE: I said above that Knighten's report of more than 20 attackers at Huddle House seemed fishy given the television web site's report of "as many as seven" people fussing with them at Waffle House. When Brinkley, the police chief, spoke to the Associated Press Monday, he said he expects an arrest soon. As for Knigthen's report of more than 20 attackers, the chief said, "From what we have seen from surveillance video and from what other witnesses say, it doesn't appear it's going to be nearly that many." Score one for skepticism. I think DeBerry is right: Mr. Knighten seems to have embellished his story. Of course, it could still be a hate crime, but wiser to keep an open mind while the facts are still so fragmentary.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I recently visited Udvar-Hazy, and I'm also a former shuttle program engineer. I recognize that maintaining the integrity of Discovery was a priority, but so much of the really interesting technology of the shuttle is hidden in the current configuration. The lack of catwalks allowing viewers to approach the control surfaces, or to look into the flight deck, seemed like a missed opportunity. Also, lines of sight from several nearby walkways were obstructed by kites and other ceiling-hung items. Are there any plans to expand viewing of the vehicle with catwalks, cutaways, etc? What about opening the cargo bay? What are the pros and cons? Great museum, incidentally. Overwhelming.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have quite a few cop friends; I certainly don't think cops are 2-4 times "worse" than the general population. There are probably a few really simple factors that account for this phenomenon: 1. Cops have stressful jobs. 2. People, cops included, don't get sufficient mental health care. 3. Cops are, generally, trained to resort to violence to resolve disagreements as part of their job. People tend to resort to their training. 4. The risk of legal penalty is reduced for cops (for reasons described in the article), and people do respond to the risk of adverse outcomes. Not only are cops not arrested when they are accused of domestic violence, they aren't even denied promotion. Police need better mental health care. They also, probably for their own good (and that of their families), need better policing of their own behavior. How to get these two goals met? A topic for some other thread, I guess. But it is weird that we're all up in arms about the NFL, when they appear to actually be doing an average job of dealing with the domestic violence issue. Meanwhile, there's less discussion about different sector, that employs more people, has a more severe problem, and also happens to comprise the group of officials *that is responsible for handling complaints of domestic violence.*</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Erased an entire career by loading a save state?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2014-10-04 07:33:28</DATE>
    <TEXT>I am not sure if I just discovered a significant bug, or if I'm just misusing the save mechanic (I certainly hope it's the latter). I was late in career mode, perhaps 50 missions underway across the Kerbal System, when I accidentally got ejected from the Jool system by an unexpected moon interaction in time warp. Without thinking about it, I thoughtlessly held F9 to quickload, not remembering that I hadn't actually used the quicksave in months (I don't usually use it). It therefore loaded a quicksave from very early in career mode, which immediately became the new persistent save and overwrote my entire career. Is this actually how the mechanic is currently set up, or is there something I'm misunderstanding? The idea that you can delete your whole career by *loading* a save file is incredibly dangerous, not to mention unintuitive. I know this is an alpha, so I'm not too sore about losing my entire spacefaring career, dozens of successful bases, a budding spaceplane industry, and an army of rescued-from-space Kerbalnauts, but I'd like to know why this happened and what I can do to keep it from happening again (save the game more often, sure, but that's what I use the persistent save state for; I don't usually like to save because it feels like cheating). Since the quicksave can be activated just by holding down a single key for 1 second, it's the sort of thing that can actually be engaged by mistake, even by a cautious player. Allowing it to overwrite your current game is a huge commitment for a single-keystroke action. I'd like to hear anyone's thoughts or advice on this.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I get your point, and it's certainly a learning experience. But no other game I'm aware of has this problem, because loading a game, quickload or regular, doesn't automatically and immediately overwrite all other persistent saves. You'd have to *actively save* after loading to do that kind of damage, and that's the issue I see here. I agree that a quickload should be instant, and if an accidental quickload meant losing everything from a gaming session, that would be irritating but an acceptable design decision. Letting a quickload destroy an entire career, from installation of the game to present, is just bizarre. It would make more sense if one's persistent save were only updated when you exited the game, perhaps with a dialog box for approval. There's "not trusted with a keyboard" and then there's "one button on your keyboard could erase and restart your entire installation"; the two are not exactly synonymous. And to be honest, I think it's a little patronizing for you to suggest that I'm in the former category: I've never deleted my entire career this way in any other game, in over 25 years of playing various video games. Believe it or not, I actually CAN be trusted with a keyboard, even with instant quicksaves/loads, under normal design conditions. What happened to me can't possibly be the way the designers intend for this feature to work, and quick-fingered gamers who can be trusted with keyboards, like yourself, need not give up their one-touch quick actions to resolve this problem. Saving the persistent state just shouldn't happen automatically, directly after a quickload. Problem solved, and you aren't "hampered". Right?</TEXT>

The very first thing I did when I saw my rickety first-generation rocket on the pad was ALT+CONTROL+DELETE in the hopes that the persistent save hadn't been affected yet, killed the game, and restarted, and my career mode was already back to year 1, day 1. I know your a Kerbal veteran, so I'm sure you're speaking from good information here. I'm not sure why that action didn't protect me--have you checked that the mechanic hasn't changed in the current release?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ok, well I'm sorry I came off as touchy; tensions run high when your entire program gets cancelled (I was on the Shuttle program when we flew the last mission, and this might actually have been a *worse* experience). I think it autowrites over the persistent save as soon as you're in a new environment (I usually notice it when I've completed an orbital maneuver), and switching from a Jool escape to the launchpad at Kerbin 20 years earlier appears to qualify. It's certainly something I hope they look into for release .26 (I think .25 comes out tomorrow or something, so it probably won't make it into there). One easy fix would be to wipe the quicksave when you quit a gaming session, so if you try to quickload when you haven't quicksaved in a given day you'd get a "no quicksave found" response. Quicksaves from a given gaming session presumably wouldn't be far enough back to threaten a program via an unintentional load. Named saves would of course be saved indefinitely. This would maintain full operability of the quick-functions, but would prevent very old quicksaves from lurking in the background, ready to derail a program. I suppose this could hurt someone who used quicksave as an actual save, expecting it to last forever, but that person a) really should be using a named save anyway, if long-term storage is her intent, and b) would still only lose back to her last persistent autosave if she quit the game and then restarted to find her autosave wasn't around anymore. Some more comprehensive fix on the way autosave functions could also resolve this issue, but this fix has the advantage of being very easy to implement and, I think, intuitively consistent with the way we expect quick-functions to work.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There's a lot of rank male stupidity in this thread, which is easy to dismiss but in this case is perhaps obscuring a few actual good points. Since u/LadyTrieu is working this page and responding politely to comments, it seems like a decent idea to try to collate the good ideas, purge them of the name calling and hostility, and try to make the best of this interesting activist brigade called Lady Trieu. Having read the [founding statement](http://ladytrieu.com/2014/10/08/brothel-1-tokyo-modeling/) I'm still not clear on whether the person(s) who launched the Facebook page are the same as the person(s) who launched the Wordpress blog and the same as the person(s) who are posting here on Reddit today. Since their undertaking is bound to be controversial (and maybe even physically dangerous--pimps are not known to be peace-loving and johns are notoriously unpredictable), the activists should be clear on whether they are a single group or different groups working to publicize each others' work. This is important, because if the Facebook Lady Trieu publishes a list of suspected johns based on license plate records (this is ethically fraught, see below), and the blogger Lady Trieu posts about it and just lists the names with no reference to how they were deduced, and the Redditor Lady Trieu comments about it and just says "John Smith frequents sex workers", then gradations of personal responsibility/benefit of doubt could be lost. If this is to be a major bit of activism, there should be unity and control of the information your group posts across various media, with consistent standards and a clear chain of responsibility. This need not conflict with an understandable desire for Lady Trieu members to remain anonymous. Assuming I am talking to a Redditor who is actually participating in the Lady Trieu (LT) project (if not Lady Trieu herself), I'll go on to a larger discussion of the work itself. Many (most?) of the critical comments in this thread seem to conflate a) consensual sex work with b) human trafficking. They could be paraphrased as "why are you shaming people for participating in generally harmless sex for money transactions?" The response is something like "but this isn't harmless; these women are being trafficked." This interaction is frustrating, because it seems like LT and the critics are talking past each other. It appears that LT and the critics agree (if tenuously) that consensual sex for money is not inherently evil and perhaps should not even be criminalized. The question is whether what's going on in New Orleans East is actually consensual. The critics suggest that, because the women could walk out the door and "go next door to McDonald's", that they can't be prisoners. This is a very naive view of human slavery, as any perfunctory review of actual human trafficking networks will reveal. Traffickers use addiction, threats of humiliation to family members, threats of violence to other trafficking victims, threats of physical retaliation or death, and many other physical and psychological techniques to retain control over victims. The fact that a sex worker doesn't have a chain around her ankle proves nothing about her willingness to work in a spa. However, the LT argument that trafficking is going on, while stronger, is not completely compelling (yet). From reading the blog entries, it appears their argument comes down to "where there is smoke, there's fire." The smoke consists of these facts and assertions: 1. Some of the men who frequent these establishment are horrible and abusive, at least according to their own writings on the subject. But we must remember that things people post on the internet are not always accurate; these men may be exaggerating their own mysogeny and brutality as a weird psychological display of masculinity -- this is evidence, but it isn't conclusive; it should be verified with interviews with workers. 2. The women are kept in suspiciously restricted circumstances; they live on-site, don't speak English, aren't allowed to leave without minders, etc. This is hugely suspicious and weighs heavily against the spas. However, we also must note that because these are illegal enterprises (even if the ARE consensual, prostitution is still illegal), we would expect some underworld-type behavior even if the women really want to be there, so again this is not dispostive and needs to be confirmed via additional investigation. 3. The owners and operators of these facilities have criminal records. Again, this does not bode well, but it's also what would be expected of the operators of a fully-consensual prostitution business; they're criminals by definition. Based on my own reading on the topic of human trafficking, I think it's very likely that some of the women working in these establishments are trafficked. Based on human nature, it's practically inevitable that some of these women are working against their will or against their better judgement. LT's basic approach appears to be a) gather indisputable evidence that illegal prostitution is occuring and attempt to have these facilities closed, and b) publically identify patrons of the establishments. Since the operations are clearly illegal, LT is totally within their rights to pursue (a). Any citizen can report a crime and seek official action. Of course, if some of these establishments are operated ethically (if illegally), they may find they are putting these women out of a job and they may be worse off afterwards. I hope (and do not yet see any evidence) that they are building a network that can help these women enter the normal economy if/when LT succeeds in having their places of work shut down. The women would surely be worse off if they had to sell sex on the street because their brothels were closed. Naming johns is more fraught. For one thing, it is very possible to misidentify someone using a license plate lookup. Plates expire and numbers are reassigned; cars are sold and titles are not updated, or cars are simply borrowed or stolen. People may park at a brothel for legitimate reasons ("I really am here to fix the cable" , "the McDonalds lot was full"). Posting mug shots of people arrested for soliciting sex is bad enough, as they haven't been found guilty of anything; posting plates that were parked at or near a brothel has all kinds of potential for error. For that matter, if LT believes (as I think they have suggested), that consensual sex work is not inherently immoral, they may be outing people who are actually good, respectful customers. There's just a lot that can go wrong. Moreover, does it actually accomplish anything? One wrong ID could cast an illegitimate light on the entire LT enterprise, while a dozen authentic IDs may change nothing. I'd like to hear much more about LT's thinking on this practice. Conclusions: 1. LT has convinced me that there's at least a preponderance of evidence that human trafficking is occuring in New Orleans East. 2. LT has not convinced me that all the brothel are equal offenders, and I don't think they know. I hope they're trying to figure that out, so resources can be focused on the bad/worst apples. 3. Efforts to shut down illegal business are perfectly legitimate; however, in the case of women who rely on illegal acts for income, shutting the businesses down could cause even more hardship if there's no plan for repatriation of the sex workers. I see no evidence (yet) of such a plan. This is concerning. 4. Human trafficking is real and a huge problem. People dismissing LT out of hand are woefully uninformed about this horrifying and very real crime. If the police won't act to protect the women in our community--and we know from experience that they often won't--it's up to our community to police itself. Like any vigilante action, though, this is a treacherous road. 5. Naming johns, while satisfying, is a dangerous activity with, I suspect, much more potential for harm than for good. This is new information for me, and a new debate; I could be convinced I was wrong on any of these points by suitable argument. Edit: list format. Re-edit: Reddit gold, like all charitable donations, is best used in small communities. So, thanks!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The author diagnoses the election dynamic correctly, but his last paragraph demonstrates a misunderstanding of the mathematics of American voting systems:  gt;A workers #8217; party financed and co-organized by the unions has that ability to smash the two-party system. Such a party can #8217;t compete with the Wall Street cash, but it can use its resources and membership to rally the broader country around a progressive platform of green job creation to fight climate change, raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour, and taxing the rich and big corporations to pay for better schools and other vital social programs. Such demands would reverberate across the country in a political landscape where working people #8217;s aspirations are complete ignored. A third party, no matter how well organized, cannot break the two-party duopoly, for purely mathematical reasons (see the many discussions of ranked voting in this thread). At best, it could displace one party, but that, too, is profoundly unlikely. Not to mention the fact that I find the author's proposed platform for this hypothetical party to be incompatible with economics. Rejecting corporate control of elections and economic dominance of the elite need not lead us to wanting to create a worker's party with an inflated minimum wage that will create a huge black market in labor coupled with social justice jobs programs that will continue to ineffectively fight climate change. It's a shame that such a cogent diagnosis was followed by such a hollow and cliche recommendation.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Your hypothetical (I read it on the blog, also), is a good one, but it's got a few flaws. For example, in your hypothetical, we have to accept that if the officials really did raid Tokyo Manufacturing, and found there were no environmental violations, and the workers were actually pretty happy, the officials would STILL shut the business down and arrest everyone because Tokyo Manufacturing makes sex. So you have to be rather careful in calling down official attention here -- some people need to be rescued from slavery, but others may just be making a living... and the two may be working at the same place! These are certainly questions worth asking, though. Given human nature, it's probably best to err on the side you're taking. I understand why you would not post any details about post-AMP care, but I WOULD trumpet that this is something you're doing. It's both important for your moral standing, and it's also something that even the most skeptical of your critics might get behind, so it offers common ground. Lastly, I really would like to hear more about your justifications for naming customers. Is that something you plan to do moving forward? It seems to be very controversial in this thread, and if it's your plan to keep doing it, you should explain your motives. If you don't plan to do it any more, it might again help you find common ground with critics if you explain why it was a mistake.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't consider that provincial or simple minded. I would say, however, that if you're filtering your johns to only call out bad offenders (ones with bad reputations for abusive behavior, or who, like Beall [I didn't know he was running for office!!], are public figures), that should be part of your pitch. Perhaps I just missed that and the blame falls on me for incomplete reading. Your response makes me wonder how you know that a particular patron is only buying sex, and ISN'T also frequenting other local businesses. That would require fairly detailed investigation, wouldn't it? And anyway, I don't know that an abusive john, as described in some of those blog posts, would suddenly be morally acceptable as soon as he bought a $3.50 pork banh mi at Dong Phuong. So consider me unconvinced by that rationale. Shaming public officials who enforce laws they privately break, however, I fully support. In fact, I'd love to see that on the front page of reddit. IF my concerns about the possibility of misidentification were addressed, of course.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is a very good point. A few counter-thoughts: Beall ran as a conservative, and certainly did not make an objection to prostitution laws part of his campaign, so calling him out for hypocrisy is justified. On the other hand, he lost, so harping on the issue is probably not helpful. LT's expose on Beall is a bit gross, but nothing in the material they reveal demonstrates an inclination to abuse or support of sex slavery. On the other hand, without the clients, there is no market... so if anyone has an obligation to be active on eradicating sex slavery, the prime onus is on buyers of sex. Nothing LT posted indicates he particularly cares either way whether the sex he buys is fully consensual. It that's an unfair characterization of his views, he should come forward and discuss what he does to make sure the sex he buys is fully consensual and ethical. I doubt he'll do that, though. For numerous reasons, some outside of his control.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well, she says she was selling a pilot in Los Angeles, and she was applying to a job at the Container Store, which presumably has locations outside of NY, so although your point is good, I'm not sure it satisfies in this case. She ended up getting a job in NY, presumably, so either her panic about paying NY rent was unnecessary (if getting the job was just a matter to time for someone with her qualifications) or she put her family in more peril to land a preferred job and lucked out (if getting the job was something of a miracle). I'm not rejecting the central thesis of her essay, mind you. But I think she's using certain assumptions of her personal situation (I need to live in the most expensive housing market on the East Coast, I need to maintain a certain standard of living) to make her situation out to be a dire as possible. This is a good literary trick but it should be recognized for what it is.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Perhaps I am projecting; let me explain my rationale and you can decide. You now admit kolamaanu isn't breaking any rules and deny you ever claimed otherwise. Let's dissect this a bit. You previously said s/he was "out of line", which is an interesting way of both insinuating that someone is breaking rules, and creating a social milieu in which your own priorities are accepted as rules, without anything being explicitly banned. What you really were saying, I would argue, is: "kolamaanu is doing something I wish s/he wouldn't do, and it's not written down anywhere, but I hate it enough that I'm going to go out of my way to make a comment publicly shaming him/her for it, in the hopes of enforcing my own judgement about how AMA's should be run." "You're out of line" is what people say when they want their own opinions to be codified in social law. So you're right, you didn't say "he was breaking any rules." What you did was much more subtle and insidious than that. You created an unwritten rule and then attacked kolamaanu for being on the wrong side of it. Others on this thread joined in, some getting hundreds of karma, not for contributing anything to the AMA, but literally JUST for enforcing the social norm that long questions are bad. Now let's look at the attitude represented by the "keep the questions short" norm you attempted to slip into r/IAmA. What exactly are you objecting to? Is this "anti-science"? I would argue that it is. This isn't a Mr. Rogers AMA, or a Katy Perry AMA. These are nine PhDs--full time space scientists--who just sent a multi-billion dollar science mission to a comet. The whole thing was on television, being watched all over the world. Some parts went well, other parts went badly. Presumably, the entire thing was riveting because this mission was important, and the science was worth doing. As someone who worked in this industry, I can tell you: it's very complicated. Short questions just aren't very illuminating. You can ask an actor what it was like working with a particular director and get a perfectly cromulent reply, but engineering questions are harder. They tend to involve parts, and scenarios, and sub-questions, and followups. What kolamaanu did was ask a question in a way designed to get the important, technical information that he, and readers like myself, actually wanted. There was no other way to do it. To deny that is to assume that space engineering is just like acting, or any other thing you might want to ask about at your elementary school career day. Well, it's not. And pretending that you can get a detailed engineering question answered in 20 words is, in my opinion, functionally anti-science. Look over the criticisms in this thread. "I couldn't get through the questions, let alone any answers" (129 karma) "it's just rudeness and poor etiquette to ask that many questions all at once. I think the trailer park boys addressed it best. If you can't ask a succinct question, then youre not going to get an answer." (68 karma) "Nice try, Russian space program." (68 karma) "Jesus Fucking Christ. Nobody is going to read that. Learn some fucking goddamn etiquette." (56 karma) "The questions sound like he's a reporter for nerds" (-1 karma... probably because no one in the short question brigade saw it). Do you actually deny the anti-science vibe of these comments? Is this just something I'm imagining or is it written out explicitly and upvoted noticeably? Let's take a moment and look at a broader view of this interaction: What is an AMA *for*? Is it for redditors who are interested in a topic to learn about it? In that case, kolamannu's was a *model* question, the sort of thing that people who are deeply interested in space science--interested enough to spend 8 years of their life studying it--would love to see answered. Or is an AMA a chance for the PR department of a large agency to build some goodwill/attention by having some disinterested actors/doctors/employees/whatever answer 4th-grade reading level questions about how awesome they are for one hour? Well... both. I have always felt like the best AMAs were closer to the former, and the worst were closer to the latter. To ask redditors to truncate their informed questions to meet the requirements of short-attention-spanned PR operators is, in my opinion, damaging to the entire value of this site. So in that sense, it isn't just anti-science, it's *anti-reddit.* That is my thinking, anyway.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It was clearly playing, regardless of your opinion about it; the fact that it was dangerous play is irrelevant. Little kids aren't great at measuring danger. Again, that's what being a minor means. If the cops hadn't killed him, they probably wouldn't even have been able to cite him. As I said, blaming the parents for letting a kid run around unsupervised with a toy gun is a defensible position. Blaming a 12 year old for acting like Calvin is silly. The "real question" is why the cops drove up to within 10 feet of him instead of approaching from a safer distance, and then gunned him down without giving him any time to react to their supposed commands. Was that their training (bad training), or was that against training (poorly trained) or was it malicious (murder)? The Cleveland police will have many more interactions with ambiguously threatening people in public places. Rice's parents will never have another opportunity to not-teach him to be responsible with a pellet gun. Therefore, both criminally and from society's point of view, the first failure is far more important than the second.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I am not sure where you're coming into this; you aren't the person I was responding to so I can only reply directly to what you're saying.  gt;I didn't read your post (at first) Ok, fine. TL;DR is a perfectly acceptable lifestyle, but it doesn't suit rocket science very well as a career.  gt;I just woke up and I have to teach a class in an hour, so as much as I've enjoyed this AMA, there's no way that I would/could take the time needed to read what essentially amounts to an article worth of technical information It took me about 2 minutes to read to original "long" question. It might take someone who really struggles with reading 5 minutes to read it. I'm not sure how rushed your mornings are, but I can devote time (maybe even 15 minutes!) to long-form reading on a topic that interests me. It's not for everyone; you're allowed to skip it. Why are you even wasting time talking to me?  gt;In my opinion, the short questions/answers are the exact point of the site; I would bet that redditors, on average, spend just a few seconds on each content post, and only a few minutes more on a topic that interests them. Very few people would take the time to read AMAs if they were filled with posts this length. If you think that I'm wrong, feel free to run a really in-depth study. I **do** think you're wrong. And I don't need to do an in-depth study to prove it; [someone already did](http://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/2leckh/oc_when_it_comes_to_comment_lengths_reddit/). Long comments are extremely popular on reddit. And for good reason: reddit attracts experts and enthusiasts, and both groups are notorious for wanting to dig deep. And this isn't just a science thing; Bill Murray's AMA was filled with long, detailed answers to questions, and those were incredibly popular. No one was complaining that he was spending too long on answers that no one had time to read. People wanted to read and read.  gt;So with that said, there are explicit rules to this sub, and implicit guidelines. /u/kolamaanu[1] kind of broke one of the implicit guidelines by posting something too long for the scientists to comfortably answer in this format (and their answers would have also taken time away from other users, who would like to interact with the scientists). If brevity is important to the mods of IAmA, it should be in the rules. Period, full stop. It's not, so he can ask whatever he wants. I have no patience for "he kind of sort of broke one of the unwritten rules that I established in my head, so I'm going to harass him about it" subreddit drama. If it's important, put it in the rules. If you don't have that power, advocate for it. But if something isn't breaking the rules, let it be. Especially, as I argued at length (you didn't even respond to this point, perhaps you didn't read that far), when the topic at hand is better suited to long discussions than it is to short snippets. ESA sent 9 people to address reddit. Are you really arguing one long question was going to keep 9 people busy for more than 5 minutes? They could have skipped any questions that didn't have immediate answers and still answered 90% of his material in a short time. And the answers would have had immense value to readers like me: far more than a dozen "what was your biggest surprise about comets" questions. The author specifically asked the scientists to answer whatever they wanted. The idea that this would break an AMA in which nearly a dozen people are participating is silly. Would it be weird to ask something like that to Joseph Gordon-Levitt? Yes. A room full of rocket scientists? No. Context matters.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>By asking how you were entering into this discussion, I wasn't challenging your right to do so, I just didn't understand what you were disagreeing with in particular.  gt;The value of a question here is generally determined by upvotes as well as the OP's response. If enough people valued the post in question, they would have upvoted it to the top. This is an interesting point, and I actually think it speaks to a problem with the way voting interacts with an AMA. For a while, the controversial "long question" was the second-most upvoted item. But then other, shorter (and in my opinion, generally much less interesting) questions got answered, and because the answers were getting read, the questions (already answered, mind you) continued to get upvotes. Therefore this long question dropped in the polls. That's really not a very functional system, if we're to assume that highly voted questions will and should get more attention from the guest. Also, the long question dropped at least 50 points over that same span, as people like you (not *you* necessarily, but people who share your opinion of what an AMA question *should* look like) shot it down. See my discussion of that phenomena below. In short, the system worked in that this question WAS upvoted highly, but it didn't work in that the question didn't get answered, despite being highly ranked for several hours (it continues to be in the top 10 questions, I believe). So anyway, I'm not sure what you're trying to prove by saying "if people valued the post in question, they would have upvoted it"; they DID. Now, as to the downvoting of the question: This is just my reddit philosophy, and I guess I can't make the world work the way I'd like, but here it is: Downvotes are not for disagreement. They are for people who are damaging the discussion, as defined by the rules of the subreddit in question. If someone posts something you don't like but that doesn't violate the rules, ignore it and move on. If you really disagree, respond and explain your alternate position. This makes for good discussions where a diversity of opinions are supported. I will personally never downvote someone I disagree with unless they are being toxic/threatening/intentionally idiotic. That's why it's so important that the rules specify what's expected of the redditor on a subreddit, and why I take the absence of a caution on long questions (in the **very long** AMA list of guidelines) as an invitation to ask them, where appropriate. Again, I reiterate, asking 9 people to respond to a handful of questions doesn't seem inappropriate to me at all. If they didn't want a lot of questions, why the heck did they send 9 people? Almost all the questions that were actually answered could probably have been handled by 2 or 3 PR flacks with a briefing document--this AMA was a huge wasted opportunity (though there were a few good interactions). As to why the scientists didn't answer this question, I doubt it has anything to do with upvotes or downvotes or even length. My suspicion is that 1) It was simply too tough of a question... specifically, it asks them to explain or speculate on a number of critical technical issues that most of the teams are either not ready to report on publically or will want to spin a certain way. I think they might have answered it one-on-one in a bar, but they aren't going to say, on reddit in digital ink, the reason why they originally misreported that the harpoons HAD fired, or the exact solar cell power profile. This is information that they will either want to trumpet or downplay later. 2) Some of the questions require access to technical materials they might not have had at the AMA location, such as the timestamp of the CIVA images. Someone has that information, but perhaps not where the AMA was happening. 3) Answering the question would presume to speak for other team members who were not present, i.e. "would you speculate on how long until every Philae experiment can say whether they got useful information." No one will want to speak for another research group. Note, however, that the asker was careful to acknowledge that s/he was prodding for an answer that might be inappropriate, and apologized in advance. Personally, I think the best response would have been to answer what I could, defer where necessary, and move on, but I somewhat suspect the PR people told them to skip this entirely rather than open a can of worms. Which is a shame. The AMA rules specifically encourage tough questions as long as they are politely phrased and not "gotcha" setups. This question certainly was polite and non-manipulative. Of course, I could be totally wrong; this is just my speculation. PS: I really didn't mean to be judgemental or to imply that you were inferior or unintelligent or bad in any way for not being a rocket scientist. I only meant to say that a space scientist AMA, hosted by 9 PhD's, seems like an environment where long discussions would be more rewarding (and, perhaps, more welcome) than one-line questions and answers. I also meant that, in general, engineering is not a discipline that rewards TL;DR thinking -- like many rigorous fields. My apologies if I didn't express that well or implied that there was some deficiency in your attitude/behavior. When I'm reading an AskHistorians on paleolithic beermaking or what-have-you, I TL;DR all the time. It's just not my area of interest.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The main (only?) argument against this is that police departments have come to rely on this revenue, and without it local municipalities will have to scrounge up extra money to cover the gap. However, New York has just demonstrated, pretty conclusively, that a LOT of city policing is essentially busy work that can be eliminated without any significant impact on public safety. In fact, anecdotal evidence suggests that in some neighborhoods quality of life has *improved* absent aggressive over-policing. Put these two facts together, and mix in a dash of horror over militarized police forces and, what the hell, a pinch of marijuana legalization, and we may be seeing an emerging groundswell, pushing back against the last 40 years' disastrous rise of the American penal system. If one ever considered becoming politically active over these issues, now would be a hot-iron moment to strike.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It was the original title which was misleading. "Poverty", when used in a sentence like "30% of families in my city are in poverty" has a technical meaning. You can have a semantic argument, if you want to, about what "poverty" should mean (after all, even the rich are often poor in spirit, are they not?), but this is an economic discussion and words like "poverty" have established definitions. No one is suggesting that kids getting reduced lunch are rich (I am not sure where you got that impression); but 51% of them are not "in poverty." According to the most recent government numbers, about 21% are in poverty. No discussion intended to make any of our kids better off can progress if we aren't even discussing the same thing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No, THAT isn't a strawman. Many of your points are good, though I disagree with a few as well. For example, I don't think articles that clarify definitions and try to explain data trends "increase apathy". In fact, the blog I linked to writes a lot about poverty and economic systems, and in general is always trying to increase awareness of these issues. We may not always agree on the cures someone recommends, but someone recommending cures and writing about economics every day is hardly "apathetic." Nor, generally, are the readers of such a source. Economic stratification in the US is definitely strong. However, the percentage of kids living below the poverty line appears to have been very stable for the past 30 years. This means we either 1) have a bad/unstable definition of poverty, 2) the data are simply wrong for some reason, or 3) even 20% of kids living under the poverty line is unacceptable, even though it's been roughly constant for over 2 generations -- maybe something terrible will happen to our society if 20% poverty rates continue much longer. I don't have any particular reason to promote any of these explanations, or some other explanation, but at least accurate data lets me think about it clearly. As for the push in the country to privatize schools, vilify teachers, etc, I think it's simply a non-sequitur to assert that insisting on consistent definitions of terms like "poverty" in any way makes a statement about those issues. I certainly have no interest in vilifying teachers, and I'm agnostic and ambivalent on charters. Similarly, if someone wrote an article that said "40% of americans have HIV", because the author had arbitrarily chosen to redefine "having HIV" as "knowing someone who has HIV", I would want to correct the record, and it would have nothing to do with whether or not I support Obamacare or want to vilify big pharma. It's just proper to correct the record so the discussion is meaningful.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A few years ago I was opposed to these measures; my feeling was that bar owners should have the right to allow smoking, and if employees and customers didn't like the smoke, they could go elsewhere. My general sense was that second hand smoke was an annoyance, or at worst created a marginal increase in your risk of cancer later in life. I was wrong about that. In 2009, [a paper was released conclusively](http://www.lung.org/about-us/our-impact/top-stories/secondhand-smoke-heart-attacks.html) showing that second hand smoke is dangerous and causes acute coronary events (heart attacks) in non-smokers who are exposed to it, even briefly. The effect was significant. The paper showed that public smoking bans slashed the rate of heart attacks in communities that enacted them. People have a right to smoke. But they don't have a right to give strangers heart attacks. So this is good news for everyone in New Orleans who likes to go to bars... In other words, everybody. I do think the ban on e-cigs is premature. There's simply no data to indicate vaping has the same second-hand effect, and pretty good preliminary data that vaping is much safer than smoking. We should be encouraging smokers to switch to vaping, unless the evidence says otherwise, so banning both was a missed opportunity. But the good here clearly outweighs the bad.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey, I enjoy your football site. But the fact is, we don't allow people to shoot guns into the air or release vials of ebola in bars. The concept is pretty simple: You're not allowed to do something that has a reasonable chance of hurting someone in a public place. The question, the actual scientific question, is "how dangerous is second hand smoke, really?" I used to think "not dangerous, personal preference, suck it up." Then the evidence (did you read the link?) became more substantial, and the answer, it turns out, was "second hand smoke is incredibly dangerous." How dangerous? It was credibly estimated in 2006--before the study I cited--that 50,000 non-smokers die in America every year, due to second hand smoke exposure. In comparison, about 16,000 Americans were murdered last year. So, for all our belly-aching about murder in New Orleans, you're probably about three and a half times more likely to be killed by the guy smoking next to you at Coop's than you are to be killed by the gang members lurking in Central City. Even assuming these numbers are alarmist and skewed, it's unlikely they are off by 350%. The preponderance of evidence is convincing and incontrovertible: smoking in public endangers those around you, and the city has a legitimate role in protecting citizens from being harmed.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's off topic, but here are my thoughts on "circle jerk": 1. It's cliche, right? In my opinion, which clearly is neither humble nor informed, very little is added to a conversation by using the term. So I'd start by asserting that it's a non-essential piece of language. "Echo chamber" works perfectly well, and in fact you used it, effectively. 2. A circle jerk, if it ever happened in the real world, is presumably something gay men would do. However, I am pretty confident that almost no gay men do it. So the very concept is something of a mis-attribution. When we use a pejorative, it's important to think about why our reaction to the term is assumed to be negative. In this case, it's almost certainly because of our association of it with gay culture. We don't call reddit echo chambers "group sex sessions" in part because the negative connotation is lost. That alone would be sufficient, in my reading, to make the term homophobic: "It's insulting because it reminds me of being gay." 3. Let's assume it's not a reference to something that gay people do. Let's assume that, as you said, it's just "us sitting around stroking each others' ego boners to make ourselves feel good." Why is THAT a pejorative? Would "mutual compliment session" be a pejorative? No, it would not be. Because "stroking each other's ego boners" assumes that we're doing something that impinges on our masculinity--engaging in homoerotic actions that are inconsistent with our masculine heterosexual identities. I'm not a big believer in sexual identity politics, I think they create a lot of angst and complexity where none is necessarily needed. But I also don't insult men by suggesting they sometimes masturbate other dudes--even intellectually or emotionally. It just seems very close to the childish habit of calling the boy who rides a pink bike a fag. You know he's not gay, you just want to get under his skin. If that's homophobic (and I think it is), then suggesting that two people agreeing with a popular opinion are stroking each other's erect penises (and the penises of all other people who share this opinion)... is also homophobic. 4. Let's assume all that is wrong, and circle jerk is not meant to be directly associated with gay culture, and isn't even meant to challenge the masculinity of the people who you are envisioning masturbating each other in a large circle. You are still assuming they are men. Again, I'm not a huge gender issues crusader, but if there was a common reddit neologism that essentially said "come on fellows, let's not be gentlemen of poor character", I would still note that it was not a very gender inclusive expression. For a diverse community like reddit, this is just poor practice. Especially when "echo chamber" is more descriptive, is equally effective as shorthand, is non-gendered, and has no baggage (however unfair) associated with homophobia. So that's what I think about circle jerk. I generally downvote comments that use it, but of course I wouldn't downvote yours, because I never downvote anyone I'm conversing with and your larger comment was quite good. I can make exceptions. I'd like to emphasize that I don't think YOU are homophobic. I think the term is. To your on-topic point, I did share this link on Facebook. No comments, no likes. The good thing about echo chambers is, at least you hear something.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's a really interesting point. In fact, reflecting on it, "preaching to the choir" IS sort of disrespectful to churches, in that it implies that a) the speaker is repeating rote information that has probably not been chewed over too carefully and b) that the choir is basically uninterested in trying to intellectually process any new information, for or against their expectations. Therefore the exercise is a waste of time, like church is. I never thought of it like that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well put. I put a lot of thought into this term because I see it so often. I agree that "circle jerk" offers something beyond "echo chamber." I just think the baggage exceeds the benefit. To your point, if "circle jerk" is intended to represent "a bunch of people masturbating in the same area", very well, that's not particularly homophobic. That wasn't my impression of the term--as far as I know it's exclusively used to describe a bunch of people AVOIDING masturbating by getting a hand job from the next person, hence "circle jerk" and not "group jerk" or "jerk salon" or "jerk fiesta". Because I think we could all get behind a jerk fiesta. Your point about women being excluded from sexual expressions is, I think, a weak one. "Jerking" is clearly a male-specific action. And if women have been excluded from boys-club behavior and language in the past, how exactly does that endorse finding new expressions and activities that exclude them? Why don't we *stop* doing that? Incidentally, Urban Dictionary agrees with my impression: circle jerks involve guys giving other guys hand jobs... take that for what you will. I am not sure I want Urban Dictionary on my side in life.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I had to dig deep to find this comment, it really did get buried. Very good points throughout, I'd like to respond to some areas where I disagree. First, to your setup point ("if this hadn't been by Snowden, it would never have gotten XXX upvotes"), yes, well, that's how the world works, reddit in particular. Dude on the street says something clever, no one responds. President Obama says it, and it's in red letters on Fox News within the hour. I don't see any reason to bemoan this; it's just a form of the ad hominem fallacy, isn't it? "This is worth more/less because of the source." I happen to agree with the sentiment he's expressing--the fact that I read the comment because it was Snowden talking was incidental. But, on to the substance. * Your philosophy that, in essence, good laws don't NEED to be enforced (if I'm reading you properly), because they reflect the community values, is a good one. In 99% of cases, this philosophy will lead to better laws. As others have pointed out, though, majority rule is a dangerous thing, and assuming that a law is popular and is therefore good is dangerous territory. * I don't have any problem understanding the similarity between prohibition and slavery: both were cases where our current cultural norms (and our current laws) are vastly at odds with the law at the time. In retrospect, the laws were very unjust, and in fact dangerous and counterproductive. In both cases, people were being thrown in jail for doing things (making beer, smuggling slaves to free states) that, by today's standards, were acceptable or even noble. Presumably, Snowden is asserting that one day people who crusaded against surveillance will be vindicated by history. You may disagree, but it doesn't seem like a confusing argument to me. * You're laying out such a false dilemma here, it's beneath the quality of the rest of your post. First, "Is there a mass collection of american citizens' data?" "Most likely"? It isn't "likely", it's 100% confirmed. There's no reason to muddy the waters by suggesting that proven facts are still hypothetical suspicions. But anyway, clearly the government isn't combing through my Steak Salon receipts. That's an absurd strawman. Is THAT the level of surveillance at which you'd say "maybe we've gone too far"? Obviously, there's a lower threshold at which you'd have reservations, or outright rejection of these programs. For example, let's say I was in an Occupy Protest, at which I broke no laws. However, I did trigger a watchlist and found myself under increased surveillance. An analyst found that in college I had purchased the Anarchist's Cookbook, and therefore put me on a no-fly list, which I cannot legally challenge. Then, in review of my entire internet history, they find a discussion from 2011 on Facebook in which I mention smoking pot. Metadata of my cell phone records from that week in 2011 quickly suggest who my dealer is. Using [parallel construction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_construction), the surveillance analyst arranges to have me stopped by police on a fabricated traffic charge. When I refuse a search, a drug dog quickly and reliably generates a positive, my car is searched, an empty weed pipe is found, I'm cited for possession of paraphernalia, and although I can eventually get the charge dismissed, I lose my job. Although some parts of this story are speculative, be absolutely certain that things like this are happening right now, to real people. And, absent institutional changes, such scenarios will become more and more plausible. So really, can we drop the "big government is out to get'cha" dismissals and recognize that we have an institutional problem with the way our national security and criminal justice systems work? *On your final point, no disagreement there.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>1. I criticized an idiot on the internet, which is the same thing you are doing. That's what the internet is for. What on earth do I care if people disagree with me? I happen to have reasons to be both awake and wanting distractions that are more important than internet points, so what the FUCK do I care about your opinion? Why not keep your tut-tutting advice to yourself, mate? 2. If you can't see a correlation between a group of men sitting in a circle, manually stimulating each others' penises, with homosexuality, then I guess you have a different perception of "gay" than I and the rest of the world does. I don't have to prove that correlation, it's OBVIOUS. The only thing in doubt is whether using such a correlation in a casual term indicates *homophobia*. I argue, at length, that it does (mildly, I didn't call it a hate term). I explained my rationale at length and in simple points. That wasn't some knee-jerk reaction to a comment that gave me a sad on the internet, that was my reasoned opinion about a particular term, one I've held for years. I admitted this was a digression in my post, but asked to defend it, I did. If I sound "patently absurd" to you, then you need to look up the definitions of both "patently," and "absurd." 3. Someone, reasonably, asked if this line of reasoning could be extended to include "preaching to the choir". This outraged comment was posted before my explanation to by thoughts on "circle jerk", but instead of referring this new internet-outraged person to my other answer, I *really thought* about his/her question and, after reflection, realized that there *was* a sort of subtle critical subtext involved when people use that expression. Most people who use the expression are not religious. That's interesting. I wrote my thoughts about it. I wasn't rude or patronizing, unlike, for example, you. I don't know what about that comment was unsound, I didn't say that "preaching to the choir" hate speech or profoundly offensive, nor did I assert that ALL idioms are offensive, I just noted that there is a subtext there in the example the commenter listed. Yes I'm sucked into defending every point. As I said, I'm in a situation where arguing on the internet is better than experiencing what I'm experiencing in real life. Instead of patronizing me, which I will go ahead and give you the benefit of the doubt and say you're better than, why don't you just downvote my carefully argued points--that you claim without defense to be absurd--as if I'm the worst thing on reddit, and move the fuck on, mate? Just take a fucking breather for awhile, eh?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If I take a black and white photo of a person or scene, it's very easy to later look at and interpret that image. However, if I invert the gradient and create a negative image, it becomes exceedingly hard to interpret the scene. Is this a universal phenomenon? Is there a known explanation for why we can quickly understand a photo but can't understand a negative? Does it just come down to practice? This question came to mind as I was reading about a new photo-book [titled "Negative"](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/24/books/tiananmen-square-negatives-an-art-book-or-a-protest.html?hp amp;action=click amp;pgtype=Homepage amp;module=photo-spot-region amp;region=top-news amp;WT.nav=top-news amp;_r=0) that can only be understood by reversing the images with one's phone.

    <TEXT>I'm getting downvoted because I said something unpopular above and people are tracking my comments down elsewhere for additional punishment. That, too, is how the world works. You start by suggesting that knowledgeable people have to confront and correct lies and mistakes from the idiots in charge; I'm not clear if you're suggesting that some such error is in play here, if so, can you clarify what it is? * I agree with your larger point, and I stipulated that majority-rule type laws will be functional 99% of the time (this is actually probably a bit too high, but the point stands), so we're probably not too far apart here. Let me try to feel out what we're both trying to say. We live in a world where, just to pick some random examples: The Iraq War happened, the tiny percentage of the richest people in the world have appropriated unprecedented chunks of the world's wealth, where banks laundered money for drug cartels without legal consequence, where the United States imprisons a larger percentage of its population, by far, than any other nation, and where the government instituted a torture program, and the only person who got in trouble for it was the one who leaked information about it to journalists. Those are just things that happened. They were all "legal". So are we currently living in a world where rule by majority is working, in your opinion? I'm not asserting that this view is wrong--many forms of crime are dropping and by many measures, standards of living are increasing. But are you asserting that a world where all these things happen legally is one that is performing, on balance, pretty well with its balance between morality and legality? Also, I hate to play a cynical card, but saying that "majority rule ... is how laws are crafted, and how reality works ... our judicial system ... strikes down any laws that can be seen as harmful" makes you sound a bit naive. Bad laws stay on the books for years, sometimes generations. Courts show absurd deference to lawmakers (and vocal voters). Actual laws are produced by a concoction of lobbyists, lawyers, and industry groups, well compensated and well insulated from the unwashed masses. THAT'S how reality works, and the will the actual majority is rarely honored, or even acknowledged. Am I wrong here? Am I being too cynical? I don't feel like my bemoaning the cracks in democracy (at least American democracy) is particularly controversial. * It's perfectly fair to say you don't LIKE the way he equated them. My sense of your original comment was that you couldn't make sense of it, which seemed intentionally obtuse. I don't want to argue against your preference, but if he'd wanted to pick other extreme examples of injustices that happened under rule of law, he could have taken his pick (the displacement of Native Americans, the internment of Japanese Americans during WWII, the protection and repatriation of Nazi war criminals, or for that matter, the firebombing of Dresden, all happened under the aegis of law, and that's just off the top of my fairly-uneducated head). I think that bringing up alcohol and marijuana prohibitions just highlights how legal injustices can be both overwhelmingly monstrous and absurdly banal. But that's just, like, my opinion man. * If you think that using Facebook means a modern citizen has no remaining expectation of privacy, then by all means give me all your financial records. Otherwise, I'm not sure what point you're making. I agree that we're living in a world where government overreach--conducted in secret--and corporate overreach--conducted in legal obscurity--are eroding our private spheres. I am not sure but I think we agree this is a problem. Is that right? PS: "The Fed" usually refers to the Federal Reserve Bank, I presume you meant "the feds" as in random federal agents? * Again, your last point is well put and I agree wholeheartedly.</TEXT>

We can complain all we want about the idiocy of the market. Clearly, the people who pay for this are utter morons. But the market exists and the results speak for themselves: The rangers have NOT been able to stop poaching. But the poachers are selling magic beans. This isn't heroin or conflict diamonds. You can flood the market with magic beans. Just take a metric ton of beans, and say they are magic. Poof.

    <TEXT>"Electrocute" was originally introduced as a slangy combination of "electricity" and "execute" and was very controversial in its day. Even now, people argue whether it can be applied to unintentional deaths or non-fatal shocks. quote from [source](http://www.visualthesaurus.com/cm/wc/electrocution-a-shocking-misuse/) follows (unsure of formatting, as i'm phone typing)  #61185; #61185; #61185; #61185; #61185; #61185; #61185; #61185; #61185; #61185; #61185; #61185; #61185; #61185;  gt;Some immediately objected to this new form of capital punishment  #8212; and to the word used to describe it. People were bothered not by the word's misuse but by its very existence. As Ben Zimmer shared with me, an 1895 issue of Stoves and Hardware Reporter repeated a claim that "bike and electrocute are about the worst travesties on words that ever were foisted upon a long-suffering public," and the word was used in Webster's New International Dictionary to illustrate a barbarism, that is, "a word or phrase not in accepted use": "'to electrocute' is a barbarism." And in an 1891 issue of The Engineering Magazine, the author of an article on electricity went so far as to say, with more than a little hyperbole, that "the Barbarity of #160; the Word Electrocute exceeds by far that of the process of killing which it indicates." The author considered several other alternatives before recommending his own coinage, "the easily spoken and euphonious 'katelextrize.'" Perhaps unsurprisingly, his form did not win out. The public had already settled on electrocute.</TEXT>

According to an appellate court, [the requests themselves don't "satisfy legal requirements."](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/08/us/nsa-phone-records-collection-ruled-illegal-by-appeals-court.html?_r=0) I find assurances like this very hollow: the laws are written and interpreted so broadly that almost anything can be claimed to "satisfy legal requirements" by SOMEONE, and because these claims are often secret, they don't get judicial review. Can you explain in layman's terms what sorts of requests are "overbroad" and how **exactly** you push back when a government official says a request is legal and your legal team either disagrees or is unsure if the government is interpreting their authorization appropriately? If this is addressed elsewhere in this AMA, please feel free to refer me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ok, you did a really good job here sorting out various movie errors and peculiarities... A few questions: 1. What do you call it when a character does something that is not just "dumb" or unexplained, but appears to be in direct contravention of his or her stated goal? For example, when the hero cop's partner reveals himself as the villain at the end of the movie and tries to kill the hero, but the same partner saved the cop's life earlier in the movie. I mean, you CAN come up with some bizarre scenario that makes it "not physically impossible", but it's not *just* that the partner was being dumb or did something off camera that the director chose not to show (like go to the bathroom). Instead, a character at one point demonstrated a willingness to risk his life to save another character, when later it is revealed he was secretly trying to kill this character all along -- is that not a kind of unresolvable paradox? In my experience, almost every movie with a "our friend and ally was actually working for the enemy all along" movie is guilty of this to SOME extent, but some cases are much worse than others. 2. By your definition, which is admittedly very strict, I'm somewhat surprised you were only able to find a single true plot hole. I mean, since the one you described was time-travel related, actually we could produce a whole family just of those. For example, when Marty McFly changes his parents' lives for the better, he comes home and is surprised by their neat, wealthy home. But in this new reality, he's been living in that home all his life (just like the cell mate has been staring at those scars since the main character arrived); why is Marty able to remember the old reality? It seems like the same physics are in play there. Almost every time travel movie has terrible causal physics, so I would think you could come up with hundreds of these. For example, in Interstellar, the "ghost" in Murph's room tries to tell Coop "STAY"... but it also tells Coop how to get to the NASA base, which is like saying "GO". This is weird... especially when it's later revealed that both messages came from Future-Coop, and were sent within a few seconds of each other in his reference frame. 3. What about when a substance/device that is explained in-universe to behave a particular way behaves a different way? For example, when the incredibly caustic monster blood in Pacific Rim gets all over Ron Perlman but doesn't hurt him in any way, are we OBLIGATED to come up with some bizarre "well, maybe the acid blood is neutralized by the particular strain of cotton his suit was made of" in-universe explanation, or are we allowed to say "that makes no sense, the screenwriters just weren't paying attention"? The latter seems like a much simpler philosophy. It's a bit perverse to say "if there is any *possible* way to explain X, then assume that is what the screenwriters meant," especially when the flaws are blatant or egregious. All in all, I would amend your definition a bit. To me, a plot hole has to satisfy the following criteria: 1. It has to create a logical inconsistency within the defined rules of the given story's universe. 2. The event or occurrence that leads to the plot hole has to be an intentional part of the story. 3. It has to be **generally** unexplainable by the rules of the universe. (If the required explanation would require a perverse amount of coincidence, mental lapses totally not suggested by the rest of the story, or bizarre exceptions to common sense, then the writers created a plot hole because they failed to explain or lampshade this discrepancy: It was, to borrow your Indiana Jones example, "a fridge too far.")</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's unfair to judge someone against an impossible ideal, and so far, no one, not even the heads of the NSA and DCI have been able to articulate a single harm that has accrued from Snowden's revelations. If you can name such harms, you should do so. Saying "you were wrong for doing X that did damage, because you could have done it perfectly, theoretically," is both logically flawed and also factually baseless. So: Gate's criticism is cogent, but it has no merit, and I have to say, unless you can back up your criticism with some evidence of harm (court judgments finding the programs are illegal are objective evidence of good), then I think your criticism is similarly baseless. Bringing up Wozniak's presence in Dubai is essentially an ad hominem, and add nothing to the debate either way. Similarly, knocking Snowden for ending up with Russia shows a complete lack of knowledge about the actual circumstances of his flight from Hong Kong: he was booked to fly out of Russia when the US cancelled his passport, making further travel impossible. Bringing things like that up makes you sound either a) ignorant or b) disingenuous. If the former, I can recommend some reading on the subject. Your comment seems reasonable, but not fully considered; I'm open to being convinced otherwise, though.</TEXT>

This is the same hollow innuendo game played against Dan Elsberg: "you're bad because you hurt national security. How? Somehow, we're not sure, but we're embarrassed so you must have done something to hurt America!" Break the so-called circle jerk. Demonstrate some harm. Or if not snowden, manning. Anyone.

    <TEXT>I don't have a particularly strong opinion about the Ashley Madison hack (yet) since the impact is unclear and the attackers' motives are obscure. But I did happen to follow the mini-story this weekend about Gawker's outing of a corporate executive's gay affair, and, like Dan Savage, I found myself perplexed by the differing reactions to these [essentially] doxxing attacks on cheaters about whom we really know very little. Right now, I think this article best articulates my evolving opinion, and I think it makes a good contribution to this developing story. As usual with Savage, the writing is crisp, readable, and credible.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Your point has legal merit in terms of resolving prosecutions, but Savage is responding to people's statements of support for the acts themselves. In one case (and he cites examples), people essentially say "leave people's private matters alone"; in the other case they say "I can't wait to watch these exposed people suffer." To follow your metaphor, it would be as if on one day a corrupt banker looted a bank of depositors' money, and people said "that's reprehensible, all those customers were left penniless!", and the next day a bank robber hit the same bank and people said "well, that's what can happen when you put your money in a bank... tough." *Of course* we have different expectations of bankers and bank robbers (and therefore, you can argue that the bankers' action was *worse*), but it seems to me that stealing depositors' money is either ok or wrong, no matter who does it. Doxxing a cheater is either ok or wrong, no matter who does it. And that *isn't* a false equivalence. It's an actual point of equivalence, even if all the factors are not exactly equal.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think you've summed the situation up beautifully; I certainly don't disagree with any of that. I am against what Gawker did AND against what the hackers did. And I'm not gleeful about the Gawker guy or the 35 million cheaters getting exposed (I'm perfectly willing to believe a lot of them are *terrible* people, I'm just in no position to assume this is a just outcome for all or even most of them). I would only argue that, since Gawker and the hackers engaged in the same action, maybe even with the same motive, people should try to grapple with whether they can/should assign different moral responses to each. I would add, though, that I'm stunned, really truly stunned, at the level of insecurity this demonstrates from an internet actor (Ashley Madison) that, you'd *think*, would have had customer security overwhelmingly on their minds. A sobering reminder of how hard it is to keep anything secure today. Without knowing exactly how the hack happened, I have what I can only describe as a feeling of professional disdain for A.M. And it makes me worry about all those grocery store rewards programs and pet toy websites I have signed on to over the years. That, at least, was something I never worried about when Gawker was outing executives.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ah, I do love an extended conversation. I'm sure people who are interested in cheating will always find ways to do it, hell, there's probably a subreddit for it (I just checked /r/Cheating exists and is active, /r/cheat is set private, and /r/cheated was banned), so this isn't a problem Ashley Madison shares sole responsibility for promoting... but they DO advertise on a lot of other sites, so in that sense they are actively encouraging people who are on the fence to take the plunge, both by planting the idea AND by lowering the cost. So... I guess I think they're culpable! Does that mean they deserve to go out of business? See below: I'm of the opinion that we need higher security standards across the board. Based on this catastrophe and several others, I think unencrypted user account information should not generally be available even to a cleared insider. Highly sensitive information should be uniformly restricted, perhaps only available when several independent actors request them, akin to how nuclear missile controls work. Since I'm not an IT or security expert, I'm not sure how this can be implemented (even the NSA appears to have been unable to stop a dedicated insider from walking out with the house silver), but more and more I'm convinced that no company, no matter how dedicated, can be trusted with some information. I'll be looking closely to see how AM got compromised, but to the extent that they were making security/confidentiality promises that they couldn't keep, they absolutely SHOULD go out of business, and every other internet site should be watching, and on notice.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ah, now it's MY turn to accuse YOU of false equivalence! I'm not super-familiar with BDSM, but I am certain that practitioners understand that consent is absolutely essential. Similarly, I assume that people engaged in rape play also know the difference between play and actual rape. So I don't think either one is an example of "encouraging the real thing", any more than first-person-shooters encourage mass shootings, or Space Invaders encourages, um, alien genocide. From what I know of it, the evidence has not shown a relationship between simulated play and real world action. But Ashley Madison wasn't facilitating a cheating *fantasy*, they were facilitating real cheating. It would, I think, only be equivalent to a BDSM community that actually offered you the opportunity to kidnap and torture someone. In that sense, Ashley Madison isn't on a slippery slope: it is squarely at the bottom of the hill. Your bar comparison is... more problematic for me. Certainly, a bar directly facilitates alcoholism. There are laws about serving the obviously intoxicated, and these seek to reduce bars' direct culpability, but I admit that if I owned a bar, I would struggle with this moral question. I'm not sure I can answer it.</TEXT>

If the Merlin engines actually ingested gas (helium, GOX, or some mixture), the turbopumps would probably spin up and explode, and you'd have bigger problems than an over-rich combustion ratio. I am not sure how SpaceX handles this, but on Shuttle, we had a series of wet/dry detectors at the bottom of each tank; when a certain percentage of them read dry ("you're about to ingest gas") the engines would shut off whether you were in orbit or not.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks for contributing that! I never complain about walls of text: real effort is what makes this a good sub. So, I'd like to ask a few followup questions, if you don't mind. A lot of your comment is essentially arguing that "perfect security is impossible," which I totally agree with. And, as I said much higher up, without knowing exactly what happened here, it's hard to draw any clear lessons from this incident. But it sounds like you do agree that there are a number of reasonable steps that companies can take that will improve (perhaps drastically improve) their security, if they were only willing to prioritize doing so. I'm an engineer, so for me a lot of this comes down to cost-benefit. And, from your comment, it sounds like companies are undervaluing the benefit (not being driven bankrupt by one disastrous hack) of implementing best security practices. So my question is: how elastic is their spending/reward function here? If they increased funding/attention to security by, say, 50%, would they be achieving only incremental gains in security (1-5%), or is there low-hanging fruit that could net impressive gains for a small increase in attention/expenditure? For example, insisting that your IT staff work in pairs during debugging exercises when they have access to critical systems/data would quickly slash the danger of a lone wolf, because she would HAVE to have a particular accomplice. That could reduce the danger of an attack of that sort by a factor of hundreds, while, depending on exactly how the work was normally apportioned, only added a few percent to the operating budget. If this is the most dangerous attack (and it seems to be a candidate for Ashley Madison, based on their comments), I'd call that low-hanging fruit.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is a very cogent response. You're right that both Greenwald and Savage go out of their way to present a non-traditional marriage as more probable than simple statistics would dictate. I would take that less as an actual assertion by them, and more of a pure rhetorical tactic. Essentially, I think they are arguing "even if there's a 10% chance that this was all above board, you should just butt your nose out." That's a debatable point. Would you expose 10 cheaters, catching 9 bad people but ruining/complicating the life of one happy swinging couple? Perhaps another question is: even if you're willing to make that one happy couple collateral damage in catching the other 9, what about the kids/families of the other 9? Are you sure that exposing them is actually for the greater good? Intellectually, I think Savage and Greenwald are both of the "butt out" school, and if they're using some biased or slanted (but not outright disingenuous) language to make their point, I don't have a problem with it. Also, I wonder whether, with both of them being gay men, they're more likely to consider alternative lifestyles to be normal and talk about them as being at least as probable as the traditional American monogamous nuclear family. From their perspective, this is absolutely true.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hmm. I'm not a lawyer, but I'm pretty confident that although there are US states with hate crime laws, there's no state that bans words themselves. So, spraypainting "nigger" on a black family's house would probably (rightfully!) be prosecuted as a hate crime, whereas writing "LOL-WUT" or some other nonsense on their house would be simple vandalism. In contrast, there would be no crime in reporting on someone using the word, for example, in an essay. I mean, lots of major published US works use the word extensively (see Pulp Fiction, or Blazing Saddles, or heck, half of the rap music released since 1985), and they face no legal penalty. The word is *definitely* loaded. It's extremely offensive. But the whole article was about how sometimes using offensive language is part of communicating difficult and controversial truths. Moreover, the article quoted many, many "negatively loaded" words without censorship. If the author was trying to make a point by printing "n****r", but writing out "cunt," I don't really understand what the point was... so it was poorly done. I find both highly offensive, but I don't have any problem with seeing them written out in an essay about offensive words. I certainly can't think of a cogent policy that would allow one but censors the other. It's very curious.</TEXT>

That choice of username seems either to be a presumptive accusation of racism aimed at the person reading your comment (embedding exactly the sort of "vindictive protectiveness" you're saying you don't observe in academia directly into your reddit persona), or a *sarcastic rejoinder* to someone accusing you or others of racism (a *response* to vindictive protectiveness, suggesting you encounter it often enough to work it directly into your reddit persona). Either way, this seems like an odd choice of username for someone who is not exposed to much "PC-censorship."

    <TEXT>I agree with the argument. An ad hominem fallacy would be an attempt to reject the argument. I'm not. But if a person who called himself "that-is-a-microagression" said "I don't really think people accuse each other of microagressions as much as you think they do" would it not be reasonable to ask him/her why they called themselves that? I mean, it was obviously a conscious choice. If the person responded "it was just a joke, it meant nothing to me" that would be a valid answer. I don't know how much clearer I could make it that I found the argument itself sound. But thanks for poisoning the discussion and trying to make me out the be some devious person. Jesus.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks for that very illuminating answer. /u/Hot4_TeaCha in this thread seems to have interpreted my very question as some sort of microagression or logical fallacy; I'm glad you didn't interpret it that way. So, as a followup, this appears to be an issue you've given a lot of thought to, and have a lot of direct personal experience with. I can't imagine someone who'd be more in tune with campus sensitivities than someone studying/teaching Middle East ethnicity and religion. And it sounds like you DO have to deal with frequent "dumb" conversations about race, but you don't interpret them through the "trigger warning" prism that this years' bumper crop of dire culture-war articles are decrying. Can you explain a bit how you differentiate between a student complaining that a certain part of your curriculum is racist or racially insensitive (the people in your words who "only see it") vs a student trying to squelch, sequester, or censor that same material? I guess what I'm asking is, "Is there a role for increased sensitivity, as long as there aren't administrative repercussions for having a discussion?" If you'd like to pose that question differently, I'd be happy to hear that too.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Both questions are interesting. Obviously, we should focus on the evidence we have, and not waste too much effort speculating about evidence that doesn't exist. But when a large economic powerhouse with many billionaires and millionaires and rich politicians is disproportionately underrepresented in a leak like this, it's reasonable to spend SOME time and energy asking why that is. If there's a good explanation, it will itself be illuminating. If there's no good explanation, we have more questions to ask, and perhaps answer.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>[Wikileaks](https://twitter.com/wikileaks?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) has been very aggressively reporting on it. They are also holding a vote on whether to release all 11 million documents (apparently they have access to them all). So that's a good, if perhaps extreme, source. [ICIJ](https://twitter.com/ICIJorg) is the source agency. [Adam Johnson](https://twitter.com/adamjohnsonNYC) has been vocal about them, and also skeptical about possible motives of the leakers and publishers. I first heard about them from /u/suddenlysnowden's twitter feed, which announced them *minutes* after they launched. So he seems to have close-at-hand knowledge of this leak. Interesting. I'm not a huge twitter maven, so perhaps others can suggest more relevant sources.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I understand what tax avoidance is... at least in the US. Here the term is specifically used to differentiate legal tax dodges (avoidance) from illegal ones (evasion). Again, I have no problem with legal tax avoidance. It's perfectly rational behavior. I do have issues with certain tax loopholes that ALLOW certain groups to avoid certain taxes. A topic for a different thread. As for Cameron and his history of criticizing tax avoidance, this seems like a slippery and nebulous issue, where anyone can see what they want to see. Which means I could certainly be wrong about feeling like Cameron is acting like a hypocrite. But it could also mean that some are willing to give him a pass when he at least deserves some legitimate criticism. I'd like to go through the four cases described in my link to the Independent, above, and I'd like to see how you respond to each one, if this interests you. Case 1, regarding Jimmy Carr. You seem particularly familiar with this one. The quote the independent gives is  gt; #8220;Frankly some of these schemes where people are parking huge amounts of money offshore and taking loans back to just minimise their tax rates it is not morally acceptable." I understand that this scheme involved literally *hundreds of millions of pounds* of tax avoidance. Perhaps that's the limit at which Cameron believes legal offshore tax avoidance becomes illegitimate. But it's unclear. There appears to be compelling, uncontested evidence that his own father kept hundreds of thousands, or perhaps millions of pounds offshore to avoid paying capital gains taxes (among other taxes, I think, can you clarify?). And Cameron himself profited, to a degree, from this. Is his argument that, because it wasn't *as much* as Carr, it wasn't unacceptable? Was it that Carr used a *different* loophole? The bright moral line is not apparent to me. Perhaps Cameron just isn't explaining his position clearly. Or perhaps I haven't seen his clear explanation. Case 2, at the WEF:  gt; #8220;We want to use the G8 to drive a more serious debate on tax evasion and tax avoidance #8221; Well, for better or worse we're having that debate now. It didn't seem like Cameron was too keen to have that debate start off on his own personal finances, but if he really wanted to have it, this is a very powerful opportunity for him to talk about how tax avoidance works in practice. He obviously knows a thing or two about it. That isn't a criticism. If I wanted to have a debate about tax avoidance, I'd absolutely want to be able to listen to someone for whom tax avoidance was a real part of life. After all, what would *I* know about it? I don't have any idea how to set up an offshore account. Perhaps he feels like he can't discuss this with people, because his opponents will not approach this issue in good faith. But if he meant what he said about driving a debate, he might as well start being honest about real-life tax avoidance, instead of giving technically-true but misleading statements, like "I am not currently profiting from offshore accounts and I don't currently own any." Yes, David, but you *did*, and fairly recently. Disingenuousness comes naturally to people with hypocritical tendencies. Case 3, to Good Morning Britain:  gt; #8220;Tax avoidance, in these cases, of very aggressive tax avoidance schemes they are wrong and we should really persuade people not to do them. #8221; Again, this seems like the sort of political speak that could mean anything to anyone. Is Carr *too aggressive*? Is his father *just aggressive enough*? It seems to me that anything that's legal, people are going to do. So really, the only question is "what should and should not be legal?" How are you supposed to "persuade people" not to do something legal that will save them millions? You really can't. Anyway, anyone can interpret this quote to mean anything, so I don't think there's much to discuss, but I can certainly see why Cameron's critics would find this offensive. Case 4, at G8 Summit:  gt; #8220;You have to collect the taxes that are owed. That is only fair for companies and people who play by the rules and it #8217;s vital for developing economies too. This one really annoys me. He obviously grasps that offshore tax avoidance schemes are ruinous for poor, unstable, or developing countries. And yet he also MUST have been familiar with these very shady, very mercenary firms that set up accounts for rich despots and wealthy elites, because he was actively doing business with them. Sure, it was legal. But he also seems to have a very real grasp of the damage that this legal behavior is doing around the world. But it didn't stop him. In fact, he seems to have done everything he could to prevent people from knowing about his contact with this world. He seems to very much want to moralize to others while refusing to accept the moral weight of his own actions. That's a human weakness. I don't think he's uniquely evil. It's also totally possible his critics are being unfair. If you're right that his dealings with his father's offshore accounts, and his mother's death-tax avoiding gift, and these other transactions, are very nominal, very moral, very ethical tax-avoidance actions, I'll just say that his prior rhetoric doesn't make it clear how he wants us to draw those moral distinctions. And that's what this debate, really, is about. Thanks for taking the time for this discussion. Sorry for the long-form text.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's a noble idea, but the author himself seems to realize it was a bust and the photo essay was the best part of it. It's interesting how incisively he criticizes his own reporting, calling his questions unoriginal and his conclusions vague. I find his writing style annoying. I have a decent vocabulary but I had to look up words a few times and even so I'm not sure if he's using the words incorrectly or just in a context alien to me. He calls a collection of farm implements in a museum "stochastic" and "reptilian". I presume he means " randomly assembled and of unclear purpose " but why dig up such odd words to describe such a mundane scene? It comes across as the overcompensation you might expect from a guy who berates himself for accidentally slipping an "I reckon" into a question. Great photos though.</TEXT>

This Yahoo one is straight news, but does not provide full context. The recorded conversations appear to be a figurative smoking gun, proving that Dilma's impeachment is more about slowing or stopping the Car Wash corruption probe than it is about her financial transgressions. The Intercept reports the Brazilian military was involved in the "pact"; Yahoo does not mention this. Hopefully there's more thorough US reporting in the coming days.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm willing to accept that I'm wrong here, but can any lawyer chime in? If Snowden were convicted under the espionage act, after making *no* public interest defense, would his lawyers be able to mount that defense during sentencing? Would the judge have any leeway under sentencing guidelines to *consider* those arguments, if they were allowed? If the judge, under Holder's logic and assuming what you said is correct, were free to reduce a 35 year sentence (similar to Manning's) to, say, 30 years, that would be a rather poor substitute for a real public interest defense. And the judge would be under no compulsion to do so. Can any lawyers speak to a) whether this sentencing distinction exists and b) whether it can or would make any difference in a plausible sentence?</TEXT>

The nomination is consecrated by a media organization, on a day when nobody voted, based on secret discussions with anonymous establishment insiders and donors whose identity the media organization  #8211; incredibly  #8211; conceals. The decisive edifice of super-delegates is itself anti-democratic and inherently corrupt: designed to prevent actual voters from making choices that the party establishment dislikes. But for a party run by insiders and funded by corporate interests, it #8217;s only fitting that their nomination process ends with such an ignominious, awkward and undemocratic sputter.

And since it's not being communicate directly to some officers who are considering pulling you over, it's not obviously intended to threaten. If I wrote on the internet, to no one in particular, that I'll shoot anyone who damaged my rose bushes, is that a threat unprotected by the first amendment?

    <TEXT>I'm not a lawyer, so perhaps someone with more knowledge can chime in, but the Supreme Court has consistently ruled that threats have to be specific and imminent to be outside of first amendment protection:  gt;Threats of Violence Against Individuals. #8212;The Supreme Court has cited three  #8220;reasons why threats of violence are outside the First Amendment #8221;:  #8220;protecting individuals from the fear of violence, from the disruption that fear engenders, and from the possibility that the threatened violence will occur. #8221;980 In Watts v. United States, however, the Court held that only  #8220;true #8221; threats are outside the First Amendment.981 The defendant in Watts, at a public rally at which he was expressing his opposition to the military draft, said,  #8220;If they ever make me carry a rifle, the first man I want to get in my sights is L.B.J. #8221;982 He was convicted of violating a federal statute that prohibited  #8220;any threat to take the life of or to inflict bodily harm upon the President of the United States. #8221; The Supreme Court reversed. Interpreting the statute  #8220;with the commands of the First Amendment clearly in mind, #8221;983 it found that the defendant had not made a  #8220;true  #8216;threat, #8221; #8217; but had indulged in mere  #8220;political hyperbole. #8221;984 So here, someone actually *specifically* said he would shoot the president of the united states, and the supreme court reversed the conviction and said this was protected speech. If I can say "If I get drafted, I'm going to murder the president", surely a woman can say "If I get stopped by the police, I'd murder them." It's not an imminent threat, it's "political hyperbole." If she were holding a gun, and pointing it at a *specific officer*, that would be an imminent threat and she could be convicted. But I'm not a lawyer and my views are probably not popular in this thread, so believe me at your own risk.</TEXT>

But the man in the precedent case DID specify a particular president. And the overall climate may seem intense now, but how do you think it felt in the 60s, during the Vietnam war, a few years after someone had actually shot the previous president with a rifle?

    <TEXT>I find articles with this tone a bit frustrating... they take the form "x problem with driving makes it really hard for machines, while human drivers can use common sense to find a solution." Almost always unstated: humans using common sense fail to solve these problems ALL THE TIME. That's why 32,000 Americans die on roads every year, and countless more worldwide. The emphasis should always be on how much better or worse the machines are than a typical human driver. Humans also miss their lanes, lose lights in glare, and fail to anticipate kids running into streets. These imperfections are not, necessarily, impediments to deploying driverless cars, unless the vehicles are unable to beat an average driver. The article doesn't address that question at all.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[TOMT] An early 80s (late 70s?) [TV show] with an anthropomorphic talking bee who gave creative writing prompts</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-10-01 04:46:37</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm looking for the name of a show from my distant childhood. Probably it was on PBS-type channels in the early 80s. I am fairly confident it aired during about the same period as "Read All About It!" and "Today's Special," though I'd only say I'm 50/50 on it actually being a PBS broadcast. Best guess for date would be 1981-82. The main feature I remember clearly was that one of the main characters was a talking bee. I seem to recall that the bee was a writer of some sort. He might have worked at a newspaper. Everyone else in the show was human. I don't recall if the bee was cell-animated or stop motion, but I lean towards stop motion. He may have worked with a black woman in her 30s at the paper. At the end of every episode, the bee would offer viewers a creative writing prompt in the form of a brief vignette, which was completely stop motion animated (and fairly poorly). It would be something like "Jane was in her bed, when a creepy ghost appeared... [Jane is animated hiding from ghost]... we need your help to finish the story! Send your stories to this PO Box!" It was my first memory of being introduced to storytelling, and I'd love to know what this show was called. Thanks in advance for any help.</TEXT>

The animation was pretty good for the budget they must have had, and the writing lessons would be great for most very young kids. Add to that a secret society of creative writers, and I think this show must have had a significant formative effect on me. I wish I could see the complete series, but apparently only fragments are on YouTube.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's great, good to hear. I just wanted to make you dance around an irrelevant, unnecessarily personal, vaguely accusatory and judgemental demand for information before I'd engage with you. Why are my voting habit irrelevant? Let's go through the logic. First: I didn't write the above article, I'm just the anonymous person who posted it. That fact, alone, is sufficient to make my voting record and party affiliation totally moot. That's the point of Reddit, after all. Anyone can bring anything to anyone's attention. It's the merits of the content that matter. Second: If I were a huge Trump supporter who didn't "vote against Trump", it would be odd for me to be posting an article about the dangers of a Trump presidency, but if I'm a rare *skeptical* Trump voter, you should be happy that I'm willing to entertain doubts about him. In any event, the facts in the article speak for themselves, and my voting record is moot. Third: If I'm a huge Trump *opponent*, who donated extensively to his various opponents throughout the primary and "voted against him" on several occasions, well, that would certainly be consistent with my posting this article, there'd be very little reason to be bandying around words like "hypocrite", and your pestering questions about who I voted for **would probably piss me off**. I'll let you ponder, with whatever sincerity sensors you apparently scan all Reddit comments with, whether this second theory has any merit. The fact that I'm willing to lay some blame at Obama's feet, and Bush's (if you RTFA, you'll know the author puts PLENTY of blame on Bush, but I have my doubts you read it so I'll just lay that point here) should indicate that I'm willing to assign blame across party lines, which should be another point against the hypocrisy you seem so eager to assign. But in any event, **AGAIN**, the facts in the article speak for themselves, and my voting record is moot. I'll point out, finally, that ideological litmus tests of the form "I will not engage with Trump supporters under any circumstance no matter what they have to say, and I demand they identify themselves so I can cast them out of my bubble" are very popular across America today (check your Facebook feed), and these attitudes of political defensiveness and, yes, intolerance, are probably directly responsible for Trump's narrow victory. They certainly didn't help. That final point might give you some sense as to why I react with hostility, disdain, and disappointment to your demands for a demonstration of my voting purity.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Obama has been president for 8 years. He ran on a platform of reversing executive power, then rejected that ideology and aggressively expanded executive power, while explicitly normalizing this behavior into bipartisan consensus and, as a direct result, swaying the previous executive-power skepticism of millions of Democrats into trusting acceptance. The Bush/Obama transition was our best chance to reverse these policies, and Obama actively burned that chance. If your precious feels are served by putting someone else ahead of Obama on the blame totem pole, fine. Go ahead. Say it's all some Republican's fault. That won't change the facts, as described in this article, and I reiterate that liberals should read it, that Obama will hand the reins of a massive, secret, unaccountable military and surveillance apparatus to an unhinged sociopath. "But... but... it's really Bush's fault!! Also, why should I even listen to you, if you didn't 'vote against trump'?" Oh, great. OK, I guess we're fine now. Thanks for clearing that up! Oh, wait, I agree that Bush started it, and I DID FUCKING VOTE AGAINST TRUMP and yet--still--say it fucking with me: **Obama is going to hand over a terrifying, unprecedented, unaccountable, uncontrollable, secret military and surveillance apparatus to Trump.** So what's your point, really? The author of the article, maybe some day you'll read it, is not some liberal operative. He's not blaming Obama for electing trump. None of features of your "point" appear in this article. He's blaming Obama for what's in the headline. Accept it or deny it. It's just the truth.</TEXT>

But I don't think he ever said "I'm waiting for the good times now" line in any other episode, so it's very reasonable to assume that line is about his wife.
