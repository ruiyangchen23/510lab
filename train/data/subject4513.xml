    <TITLE>Habitats vs Megastructures?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-08-02 15:20:57</DATE>
    <TEXT>So in a game I previously just ended made my first megastructures, and I have to say I'm kinda disappointed. (With the exception of ring worlds). I honestly don't think they're worth the time/minerals. I actually think Habitats might be better. You can build multiple at once, you can specialize them with the same buildings, and they're much cheaper, and much much much faster to build, especially with master builder. Hell you can make more science with 3 habitats filled with labs at 1/4 the price. The only downsides are you need more influence to build multiple habitats instead of a mega structures and you have to wait for them to be filled up to be 100% effective. Let me know what you guys think.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Idea: Overpopulation.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-08-02 16:19:43</DATE>
    <TEXT>One thing that annoys me in the game is when a pop in a full world migrates and one building becomes unworked. My idea of fix this, is overpopulation: Basically, once your planet is full, another pop grows off to the side, probably at a slower rate. Once it grows it's considered an unemployed pop and the planet gets negative modifiers, including unhappiness, decreased energy, mineral, food and/or research production and unrest. You'll be able to prevent overpopulation through population control which is in species rights. There is an upside to this though, a planet that is overpopulated will have a discount to colony ships, colony ships from overpopulated worlds will require less influence to colonize new worlds and extra pops will get a higher migration speed boost. Also with this colonization will be reworked. For starters, building a colony ship will require you to use up a pop from the world the colony ship is being built. Each colony ship will have a number of pops on it, you chose there pops, allowing you to colonize planets with more than one starting species. Though there will be a limit to the number of pops allowed on a colony ship. (Starting with 2 and increased via new modules for colony ships and/or the expansion tree, the later probably replacing the opening perking for expansion). The number of pops on a colony ship will determine the price. You'll also be able to combine colony ships from different planets. There's multiple benefits to this. 1. It fixes the current problem with migration. 2. It discourages too rapid expansion 3. It encourages colonizing more planets in/around your territory. As well as habitat construction 4. It encourages migration treaties. 5. It provides a sense of realism to colonization. Let me know what you guys think.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>While I watched the latest episode, seeing how Dany treats her prisoners of war, one quote kept going through my mind that comes all the way back from season one." "Do you think it's honor that keeps them in line? Do you think it's honor that's keeping the peace?" It's fear, fear and blood." -King Robert Baratheon. Was what Dany did right, killing unarmed men just so others would stay in line, or is she becoming the Mad Queen?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Idea: New Primitive Stage.  #8220;Pre-FTL Empire #8221;</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-01-30 21:25:47</DATE>
    <TEXT>Currently the final stage in developing primitives is  #8220;Early Space Age #8221; before becoming a FTL empire. My problem comes from how big of a jump it is. Think about like this, Earth is currently in the Early Space Age and took ~200 years to become FTL (according to Stellaris Lore). My suggestion is to add a new stage between  #8220;Early Space Age #8221; and  #8220;FTL Empire #8221; which is  #8220;Pre-FTL Empire #8221; Basically their world unites under one flag and they become and actual empire. They will be able to start researching Tier 0 techs (the techs you already have at the beginning of the game). These empires will be stuck to their own system, but will be able to (once they research the techs) construct stations, colonize planets in their system (if they can) and upgrade buildings. You #8217;ll given the choice to make contact with these empires. If you do you #8217;ll trade resources, make research agreements, declare war, etc. They won #8217;t be as easy to invade as other primitive empires, actually having some planetary defenses, although relatively weak ones. Once they research all the Tier 0 techs, they are able to research they become a  #8220;FTL Empire #8221; and are able to star expanding outside their system like any other empire. Enlightenment will still bypass this stage, but  #8220;Pre-FTL Empires #8221; won #8217;t be able to be Enlightened, but research agreements will give huge boosts to their research. Feel free to tell me your thoughts on my idea, and give your own ideas (changes/additions).</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Leaders: Home World and names.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-02-07 00:26:34</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hey guys, here #8217;s a small idea I think would help for immersion. The idea is that each leader has their own home world, the home world would be pick randomly from one of your empire #8217;s planets that has the same species as the leader. Along with this, if the leader #8217;s home planet has another species on it (that isn #8217;t enslaved/unhappy) the leader could have a chance to have a name from they other species. (Ex. Instead of Mammalian name they could have a Reptilian name). This would help add the immersion of mixing cultures/species. In addition to this. Leaders could have effects if their home world is annexed /cleansed/destroyed. Note: This is separate from my original idea and should be judged separately. Names/Numbers are open to change. If Annexed: Each leader gets from that planet get the following traits/effects. Scientists:  #8220;Worried #8221;, -5% research/survey speed Governor:  #8220;Worried #8221;, -5% build speed Admiral:  #8220;Determined #8221;, +10% Firepower General:  #8220;Determined: #8221;, +10% Morale/Army damage Worried:  #8220;Their home world is annexed, they are too worried for their loved ones to work to their fullest #8221; Determined:  #8220;Their home world is annexed, they are determined to liberate it #8221; These traits stay until their home planet is no longer annexed. Wether it be liberated or lost. If Cleansed/Destroyed: Each leader from that get the following traits/effects All:  #8220;Mourning #8221;, -10% Research speed, survey speed, construction speed, fire power and morale. Mourning:  #8220;Their home world was destroyed, they are mourning #8221; This trait will be temporary. Only lasting 1 year. Afterwards they get the following traits Scientists:  #8220;Determined #8221;, +10% Research Speed Governor:  #8220;Determined #8221;, +10% Build Speed Admiral:  #8220;Avenger #8221; +20% Fire rate General:  #8220;Avenger #8221;, +20% Army Strength Inspired:  #8220;Their home world was destroyed, They are in determined to get revenge #8221; Avenger:  #8220;Their home world was destroyed, They will avenge it or die trying. #8221; These last until 1. The leader dies. 2. The empire that cleansed/destroyed the home world is defeated in war. Let me know what you guys think of both ideas.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Suggestion: Mining/Research station upgrades.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-02-08 20:25:44</DATE>
    <TEXT>This idea is pretty much self explanatory. Upgrades for research and mining stations. Basically the upgraded stations will come be unlocked through researching techs. (Either as additions to existing techs or new techs all together) There will a total of 5 tiers for each station. Tier 1 (base): 1x output (90 minerals to build) Tier 2: 1.5x output (50 mineral upgrade) Tier 3: 2x output (100 mineral upgrade) Tier 4: 2.5x output (150 mineral upgrade) Tier 5: 3x output (200 mineral upgrade) By destroying stations and surveying the debris you will gain research towards the next tier (if you don #8217;t already have it). In addition, if you win a system with upgraded stations in it, you #8217;ll get a special project to reverse engineer the station and instantly unlock the required tech. Pros: - With 2.0 wars will now be fought for systems not planets, by having stations be upgradable makes systems more valuable. - Will benefit tall empires/empires with little area. Increasing energy, research, and mineral protection. - The ascension perk that stops reverse engineering of techs will become more useful Cons: -Potential steam roll for wide empires.

    <TITLE>Suggestion: A New Life Tweak.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-02-13 22:06:51</DATE>
    <TEXT>In the Expansion tradition tree, one of the perks,  #8220;A New Life #8221;, causes all new colonies to start with two pops instead of one. The problem is that both pops are always the same species. Now this can be quite annoying if you want to multiple species on a new colony, as you #8217;re forced to resettle a pop, or wait for a pop to migrate to the colony leaving a an empty tile in one of your other worlds. This can be especially annoying for empires with Syncretic Evolution where you constantly have to spend influence on resettling. My suggestion is simple, once you unlock  #8220;A New Life #8221; #8221;, when you go to build a new colony ship, instead of just choosing one species, you choose both. The first species you choose will be the one who ends up working the reassembled ship shelter. Ex. Human and Blorg, Human and Droid, Human and slave species. This will help you have a better control over your population and help save lots of influence when it comes to resettling.</TEXT>

If you do this then each member of the federation put fourth goals against the enemy empire if they have any. (Number of goals available per empire decreases with more members). Once all goals are proposed, it voted on. Instead of a unanimous vote you only need a simple majority. Note, forcing a member into an unwanted war will hurt their opinion of you. Losing a federation war that you started will cause the other members to lower their opinion of you. Solo Wars: If you decide to leave your federation out of the war, you won #8217;t be able to use federation fleets. ([See other post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stellaris/comments/7xsxp1/suggestion_federation_fleet_changes/?st=JDOWWWKG amp;sh=02cc92a3) ) If you are losing a war you can call in your federation for aid, this will decrease war exhaustion but all decrease your federation #8217;s opinion of you. Let me know what you guys think. :)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Suggestion: Federation Fleet Changes</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-02-15 20:42:11</DATE>
    <TEXT>In 2.0, fleets with have a cap to how many ships can be in them. This opens the door a number of possible changes when it comes to federation fleets. Here #8217;s the idea: Fleet quotas. Each member will be required to donate 1-2 fleets to the federation leader. Fleet sizes are the same for each member and templets are chosen by the member who built the fleet, having access to the technology of other members. If they do not then the other members of the federation will have a decreased opinion of them which may end with the empire being kicked from the federation. The leader in turn will be able to distribute fleets among different members, having full control over who own #8217;s which fleet. Members cannot use federation fleets in non-federation wars ([See this other post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stellaris/comments/7xssj6/suggestion_federation_war_changes/?st=JDOWCDHA amp;sh=92a54bd7) ) The point of this change is to allow and encourage more cooperative between federation members, adding a sense of realism. Let me know what you guys think. :)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Suggestion: Federation Taxes</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-02-15 20:59:34</DATE>
    <TEXT>This is a suggestion to increase cooperation between members of a federation, providing a sense of realism by having all members contribute their federation. The idea is simple, each member of a federation is taxed a certain amount of their monthly energy and mineral income. (0% - 25%) Both the energy and minerals are added up and distributed evenly between each member. The tax percentage is set by the federation leader once they #8217;re elected. The percentage of energy and percentage of minerals taxes are set differently. Depending on how a member is affected by the taxes changes their opinion of the leader, if a member gains income, their opinion increases, if they lose income then their opinion decreases, and may leave the federation if their opinion decreases enough. The amount by which the opinion changes depends on how much the members gains/loses. This can help balance power in a federation by having the stronger members support the weaker members. Let me know what you guys think. :)</TEXT>

The problem is, I #8217;m not sure if I #8217;d be happy doing research for a career. I #8217;ve already helped some graduate students with their research, and instead of being thrilled, I was bored. I #8217;ve been thinking about what kinda of job I would like, and I #8217;ve concluded that I would love to work at a Natural History Museum (similar to the one in Cleveland, one of my favorite places to go as a kid) where I would help teach visitors about what #8217;s on display, and answer questions. Another one of my favorite subjects is Paleontology, so considering maybe changing my major to that, though I #8217;m really conflicted on if I should or not. I could really use some advice on what I can do to make this decision.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>[The Straw That Broke The Camel #8217;s Back](https://www.reddit.com/r/CringeAnarchy/comments/8iql59/muhammad_goes_to_school/?st=JH2UHDAM amp;sh=6c2745ce) I #8217;m a moderate right leaning guy. I first subscribed to the sub because the sub posted cringy SJW stuff along with other things. About two months back I noticed that the sub was getting more and more toxic, so I decided to unsub. A few weeks ago I saw a few posts on popular from CringeAnarchy that were actual cringy stuff, like it use to be, so I decided to re-sub. But now low effort racist shit is making it to the top of the sub. I #8217;m done. The sub is itself it now cringe, can #8217;t deny any longer.</TEXT>

The same kind of argument can be used to justify racism, sexism, homophobia and other kinda of bigotry. You can #8217;t judge a group by it #8217;s vocal minority. 6. I used to be just like you, hating Republicans as a whole because everything I heard about them portrayed them as evil. Then I started listening to some of them. Instead of evil bigots, I heard regular people who want what #8217;s best for this country. 7. Can you justify why it #8217;s okay to hate an entire group of people because of what the vocal minority says? And don #8217;t say  #8220;it #8217;s not a vocal minority #8221; it absolutely is. 8.

    <TEXT>Philip Defranco is one of my favorite sources of news. He tends put a clear distinction between his bias and the facts, instead of pretending he has no bias and then preceded to be biased like most news sources. That being said, his subreddit is biased af and extremely left leaning, to the point where if you so much as mention a right leaning view you #8217;ll be swarmed with downvotes. I even got downvoted for saying it was stupid to call Republicans in general racist nazis and how you shouldn #8217;t hate them due to what the vocal minority says. That most Republicans are normal people who want what #8217;s best for their country, same Democrats, and that labeling them all as evil nazis doesn #8217;t help anyone. The  #8220;Us vs. Them #8221; mentality on the sub is super fucking toxic and goes against one of the most appealing parts of the show, which is listen to all sides of an argument and form your own opinion. Hell even the Youtube comments have even more constructive debates, where views on either side of the political spectrum are heard. Fucking youtube is more constructive than the subreddit. That #8217;s just sad.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>[Here You Go](https://fee.org/articles/defensive-gun-use-is-more-than-shooting-bad-guys/#0) Yes, it is very debated, because it #8217;s not something easy to record. Notice how every number you mention is less than the 70,000 gun related injuries or 40,000 (10,000 non-suicide) gun related deaths each year. It #8217;s as if guns do less harm than good. Also, would you call a woman who carries mace with her everywhere incase she gets attacked? Would you thing she #8217;s dumb? That the media brainwashed her into fearing men? It #8217;s not paranoia to be prepared in case you do get attacked. You can get attacked anywhere. The fact that you can #8217;t understand that baffles me! Also I like how even though this has nothing to do with race, you make it a race thing. People don #8217;t own guns because they #8217;re afraid of  #8220;brown people #8221; I do believe the media is fear-mongering though. They sensationalize gun violence, making people paranoid about law abiding gun owners and want to take away a way for them to defend themselves. Also if you #8217;re argument is that people you disagree are  #8220;brainwashed #8221; then your argument fucking sucks.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>But that #8217;s not true. Most potential attackers back off if they think/know the crime victim is armed. And if I #8217;m going to get attacked, I #8217;d much rather have a gun that I know can stop an attacker than mace which can have mixed results. I don #8217;t see the problem of taking a life to defend your own.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>1. Wanting to be able to defend yourself doesn #8217;t make you paranoid. You #8217;re a fucking idiot 2. Have a weapon to defend yourself, unless you plan on hurting innocent life doesn #8217;t make you a danger to society. You #8217;re the one who #8217;s paranoid about guns. You #8217;re a fucking idiot. 3. They do good by saving lives. Every study done says that guns save way more lives than they take. You #8217;re a fucking idiot. 4. 3/5 of gun deaths are suicides, even with stricter gun laws there are other ways for them to kill themselves. 8/10 of the remaining deaths are caused by gang violence, which has more to do with drug laws than gun laws. Other violent crimes have nothing to do with guns and actually supports the idea that you should have something, like a gun, to defend yourself. You literally disproved your own argument. You #8217;re a fucking idiot. 5. See my previous point about how you disproved your own argument of gun owners being paranoid. You #8217;re a fucking idiot. 6. You #8217;re last point really takes the cake. Gun laws aren #8217;t the sole reason for school shootings. Actually when properly enforced they actively prevent school shootings by preventing potential school shooters from getting access to guns. The three biggest contributors to school shootings are: 1. [How The Media Portrays School Shooters](https://youtu.be/K3VQULyT390) 2. The lack of mental health awareness, only people with serious mental problems think it #8217;s a good idea to shoot up a school. The majority of gun owners don #8217;t have poor mental health. 3. Lack of security at schools, they #8217;re easy targets. Oh yeah... you #8217;re also a fucking idiot.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Even though they seek asylum doesn #8217;t mean they automatically get to live in the country. They have to be processed. The families are separated because we can #8217;t have the kids go to jail with their parents as they wait their hearing. Like we do with every other criminal. Or do you support keeping kids in federal prisons? They also need to make sure that those kids actually belong to the parents, make sure there isn #8217;t human trafficking going on. Unless you support human trafficking. Also I think you might be blind, like I said multiple times, they aren #8217;t being held in cages! And isn #8217;t providing food, shelter, air conditioning, education, exercise, protection to asylum seekers a good thing? Are you arguing we should just leave them south of the border to fend for themselves as they wait for their hearing? Or do you think we should let anyone claiming asylum into this country without question? I #8217;m sure drug dealers and human traffickers would love you for that.

Not purpose a single thing we should do instead.Claim I #8217;m literally Hitler for wanting secure border, because you #8217;re too dimwitted to not see the world in black and white, where you think everyone who disagrees with you is some evil monster.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Looking back, I realize it was kind of dumb to subscribe in the first place. Most people upvote based on titles, without actually reading articles. This makes it easy for misinformation to spread and promotes outrage culture. Take one of the posts thats popular right now, they took something a NRA member said 2 years ago, out of context, about journalism and linked it to the most recent shooting. The sole purpose of that article was to connect the NRA to the shooting and shit on the NRA because of it. That #8217;s not real news, that #8217;s confirmation bias. Not to mention that apparently the mods removed posts they disagree with. Which, if true, would make it a pure propaganda sub. Like r/Politics or T_D</TEXT>

Threats aren #8217;t illegal unless there #8217;s probable cause you #8217;ll act on them. The riots themselves are illegal, if you cause a riot you commit a crime. That has nothing to do with free speech Same thing with the fire thing, shouting fire isn #8217;t the crime, starting a panic is. No where are saying things illegal, actions regarding them is illegal. In the UK, you can get arrested for just saying someone offensive, regardless of context or action. You can just label something as  #8220;hate speech #8221; and take legal action. A dude got arrested for making a joke, and you #8217;re defending that. The government has no laws over what you say, just what you do.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I feel that they get mad because of how shitty of an excuse it is, factual or not. Every time communism is attempted it leads to mass suffering, though communism supporters just say  #8220;but that #8217;s not real communism, next time it #8217;ll work #8221; even though communism as a whole doesn #8217;t work.

    <TEXT>Yes you can because it #8217;s been proven multiple times that everytime it #8217;s attempted it fails and leads to mass suffering. The very concept of a stateless society is flawed as it leaves a power vacuum that allows totalitarianism to rise which has been proven many times.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>All you #8217;ve been doing is defending communism by shitty on capitalism. You #8217;ve done nothing but defend communism by stating  #8220;it #8217;s not communisms fault that communism has killed millions of people #8221; You #8217;re logic is inherently flawed And you #8217;re retarded.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Dude. The very first reply is you doing nothing but shitting on capitalism. You keep defending communism, yet you say you don #8217;t support it. If you don #8217;t support communism, why do you get so upset when someone says  #8220;fuck communism #8221;? The comments about hunter/gathers provided nothing to the conversation, I asked you to explain why you mentioned and you ignored me. Communism is an inherently flawed system, worse than capitalism in every single way, and has been shown that. The fact that you think  #8220;they #8217;re both equally bad #8221; is baffling. So that #8217;s why I insult your intelligence, but you #8217;re argument is fucking retarded. Yes I #8217;m attacking  #8220;a word #8221; but I #8217;m also attacking an ideology than causes mass death and suffering. Communism is evil. Look at any communist country throughout history and you #8217;ll see it. This isn #8217;t about  #8220;broad economic theory #8221; this id about shitting on a horrible ideology that idiotic people thing is the best thing ever. It #8217;s not a complex issue, stop trying to make it one.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>But it really isn #8217;t. It #8217;s black and white. Clear as day, Communism is worse than capitalism in every way. Communism has caused more death and suffering than capitalism will ever do. So shut it with the whole  #8220;what about capitalism #8221; You know who hurts people? Bullies! You know who else hurts people? Fucking Nazis. Do you think playground bullies are just as bad as literal Nazis? Because thats what your comparison is like. Yeah both aren #8217;t perfect, but one is way way way unimaginably worse than the other. Their is no reason to compare the two. I haven #8217;t ignored any  #8220;facts #8221; you given me. I #8217;ve refuted them. You #8217;re the one ignoring facts, you #8217;ve ignored literally every argument I #8217;ve made only to mention some other bs about something that has nothing to do with what we #8217;re talking about (seriously, why bring up hunter/gatherers, you still haven #8217;t explained what that has to do with anything).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I got into the Percy Jackson series while I was in elementary school, and stopped reading them around the beginning of high school, stopping after House of Hades. I was just too slow of a reader(curse my ADHD) and had too much school work to read for fun like I use to. Now that I'm in college and got into audiobooks (seriously they're the best) I've decided to re-read the Percy Jackson and Heroes of Olympus books, and I still love them. All the way up to the House of Hades. Then I got to Blood of Olympus and I have to say, it's super anticlimactic The book just felt so slow and The Giants/Gaea were defeated so easily. Easily the weakest book of either series. Am I the only one who thinks this? (Kinda new to this sub)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If you #8217;re actually watching the series you #8217;d see that Arin is complaining way more than Dan. Yes the game has its flaws, but not the the level that Arin treats it. It #8217;s annoying to have one person be mostly negative while playing a decent game.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It #8217;s because people agree with what Dan complains about and don #8217;t agree with everything Arin hates. Arin also complains way more than Dan, to the point that it #8217;s annoying to a lot of people. You #8217;re treating it like Dan and Arin are complaining just as much about the same things which isn #8217;t true. Then claiming hypocrisy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Valid? Sometimes. Annoying? Yes. It #8217;s not fun to watch an entire series where Arin does nothing but complain for a large portion of it, especially when the game isn #8217;t that bad and a lot of people don #8217;t agree with what he complains about. Meanwhile Dan makes small comments every once in awhile, making complains that most people agree with. If Dan constantly shat on this game like Arin does a lot of people would find him annoying too, but that #8217;s not Dan #8217;s personality. It #8217;s not hypocritical.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes. Because it #8217;s annoying to hear Arin do nothing but complain, especially when a lot of the complaints are invalid and/or due to his own incompetence. We get it, you don #8217;t like the game, you don #8217;t have to complain about every little thing over and over. For example, Arin complaining about the game not being open world when it was never intended to be open world. Or when he complains about it not world building enough when a huge part of this game is world building. Arin has a habit for shitting on games because he #8217;s bad at them, not because the games are bad. I #8217;m not sure how you don #8217;t see the logic in this? You really don #8217;t see the difference between making an occasional valid complaint and constant nitpicking. You treat Dan and Arin like their equally bad, while that #8217;s not true at all.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Personally it doesn #8217;t bother me that much. I also really like the game. But I understand how it can be annoying for a lot of people, and those people have the right to complain about how it annoys them. My goal is to try to show you how idiotic it is to say it #8217;s Dan #8217;s complaining is just a bad as Arins, or that a lot of what Arin complains about is justified when it really isn #8217;t.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Except they #8217;re not. A lot of people disagree with what Arin complains about, and rightfully so. (A lot of his complaints don #8217;t even have to do with gameplay, so you #8217;re  #8220;he #8217;s the one playing #8221; argument means jack, literally the game never claimed to be open world, and their is literally tons of worldbuilding) And even it they were justified, it wouldn #8217;t make Arin constantly complaining any less annoying. The series is great when Arin isn #8217;t constantly nitpicking.</TEXT>

[This Was The Final Straw](https://www.reddit.com/r/JusticeServed/comments/94ehuq/tried_ripping_up_a_sign/?st=JKETITZ7 amp;sh=de440c4e) A woman attacks a piece of cardboard and deserves to be punched in the face? This isn #8217;t justice, this is assault. Yet all the top comments are all shitting on the woman, calling here racist and making fun of her, even though they know no background information or context. Once again, something really common in this sub. Btw, the context behind the video is that people are protesting about a drunk guy who was shot by police after pointing a gun at them. So they decided to block her route home and she got upset about it. Am I saying she did nothing wrong? No. But it #8217;s stupid to act like only she was in the wrong and the protestors are in the right. It #8217;s just shitty.</TEXT>

(A black guy got shot by police because he pointed a gun at them, so it #8217;s kinda stupid to think the guy was in the right) 3. Just because you disagree with a black person.

I #8217;m not a Trump supporter, I think the man is an idiot, stop assuming people you don #8217;t like are Trump supporters. 5. I feel angry because you #8217;re a fucking idiot who assume people are racist without context. Your one of those people who over use that word to make it lose it #8217;s meaning. 6.

Also not everyone who voted for Trump is a evil person, both candidates were extremely shitty, some thought Hillary was worse, some thought Trump was worse. You can't know everything about a person by who they voted for. Stop assuming things man. It's not making you look any better.

You're literally making life easier for actual racists. I hope you're proud of yourself. I'm angry because when someone calls you out on your bullshit, instead of actually confronting them, you hide behind "stop being an angry racist argument" literally living in a bubble where you're never wrong and everyone who disagrees with you are evil horrible monsters. Is that good enough of an answer for you? Stop making stupid claims out of your ass when you have no context.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>And? There are plenty of POC in positions of power in this country. Having a majority of white people in congress doesn #8217;t mean racism towards white people doesn #8217;t exist. Or has racism against black people ended because Obama was elected president? Your logic is flawed and you keep judging people based off their skin color. You #8217;re entire argument is flawed because your logic is flawed. Nothing you #8217;ve said has proven white people cant experience racism and the fact that you keep trying to defend racism only makes you appear like even more of a racist. Jus because you #8217;re white and have a easy life doesn #8217;t mean every white person has an easy life. Stop pretending life is inherently easier for white people because of their skin. A poor white family is just as  #8220;privileged #8221; as poor black family. A rich black family is just as  #8220;privileged #8221; as a rich white family. Racism is wrong, and anyone can experience it, regardless of what race they are. Get that through your thick head man.</TEXT>

I just think it stupid to say that there #8217;s  #8220;systematic racism #8221; going on like where the government is purposely discriminating against people based off their race and nothing else, which is completely not true. Is there racism today? Yes! Is it wide spread and systematic? No.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Oof. I posted a map of the Roman Empire in r/EmpireDidNothingWrong and got banned. Mods can #8217;t appreciate superior empires. Edit: Tried reasoning with them, my god those mods are pretentious.  #8220;You were mocking up because we were asleep #8221;. It #8217;s a common joke, get off your high horse. [Here #8217;s The Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/EmpireDidNothingWrong/comments/975h1l/mods_are_asleep_upvote_the_empire/?st=JKTOL72O amp;sh=37b5b772) because you can #8217;t see it on main page.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Posted a pic of the Roman Empire, got over 1k upvotes. Banned because Mods don #8217;t like having fun. Tried to reason with them. Muted instantly. It #8217;s a fucking meme sub, get of your high horse.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I mean they listed three reasons why I got banned. 1.  #8220;Begging #8221; for upvotes. 2. Posting something unrelated to the sub, which isn #8217;t even against their rules. 3. And  #8220;Rubbing it in that I was breaking the rules #8221; by mentioning the mods were asleep. I tried reasoning why my post should stay up, the muted me. For a meme subreddit they really don #8217;t seem to enjoy having fun.</TEXT>
