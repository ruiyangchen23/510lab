    <DATE>2015-12-18 01:19:03</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hey there, I have just started to learn how to play guitar and have been watching some YouTube videos on how to do strumming patterns. Whenever I strum upwards, it sounds really weird and I can't avoid hitting all strings. I can strum downwards fine it's just upwards which is really confusing me. My guitar by the way is a really cheap second-hand nylon guitar.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;d first like to start off by thanking /u/Eleves_202 for his question. In response, I #8217;d like to state that I will push for Chesapeake moving towards more sustainable forms of energy whilst at the same time encouraging workers in fossil fuel dependent industries to transition to more sustainable industries. One of the ways in which I will do so is by encouraging the State Government to increase funding for reskilling and education programs for blue collar workers currently employed in the fossil fuels sector. I will also aim to improve Chesapeake #8217;s environment by utilizing federal grant money to implement subsidies which encourage businesses to cut down on their carbon emissions and waste levels.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I got to agree with /u/awesomeness1212 that the greatest issue facing our great state is rural poverty. To fight rural poverty, I hope to increase funding for the construction of public infrastructure projects in rural areas which will improve resident #8217;s quality of life whilst at the same time providing for employment amongst rural areas. I also hope to enable the creation of a state subsidy program in which businesses will be subsidized for moving jobs and offices out to these rural areas and by encouraging new and sustainable industries to set up shop in rural parts of Chesapeake.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Mr Speaker, I find the plans by Her Majesty's Government to refurbish the Canadian economy to be highly commendable, however I have to vehemently and utterly disagree by the plans by the Government to implement a reduction of the corporation tax rate. As our corporation tax rate is the lowest in the G7, I see and find little reason for this to be further reduced. By cutting the corporation tax rate, the Government will be further pushing the tax burden on workers and families whilst allowing multi-national corporations to further exploit our great country by utilizing our basement level tax rates. I believe that we can refurbish our economy and promote economic growth and increased employment by implementing a cut in the tax rate for small medium enterprises (SMEs) which employ 87.7% of the Canadian workforce compared to the figure employed by large and medium sized businesses which stands at 7.7%.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Mr Speaker, The Prime Minister has stated that the cut in the corporation tax will be universally implemented across all companies regardless of their size. Even if the goal behind this tax rate reduction is to promote growth among SMEs, this cut will allow for large, multi-national corporations to further exploit Canada and it's people without paying fair dividends back into the public coffers. It matters very little what the Government says that the tax cut will be targeted at. The tax cut is insufficient in promoting and protecting SMEs.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Citizens, It is most distressing that today we hear of the ban of Hayley-182 from ModelAustralia and as a community we lose a great and dedicated participant of the sim. However, I aplaud moderation for taking a firm but fair approach on this matter and reminding members that such behaviour is simply unacceptable of any sim participant, let alone the Prime Minister of Australia. As announced by the Governor General, I will serve as Acting Prime Minister until supplementary elections for the Federal Parliament are held. After the elections, I hope that my government will win the support of Parliament and govern in it's own right. Signed, /u/subject5979, The Acting Prime Minister of the Commonwealth of Australia</TEXT>

    <DATE>2017-03-26 09:31:39</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hey everyone! Year 11 student here thinking about becoming a high school teacher in New South Wales. Thinking of chemistry/maths or economics/maths. Yes, I've heard of the massive oversupply of new graduate teachers and the casualization of the teaching workforce and this is putting me off a little from pursuing this career path. I consider myself to be moderately academically successful (I reckon I can get an ATAR of 80+ and have got really good grades from 9-10) and am thinking about applying for the various scholarships that teach.nsw has on offer (although I've heard they're competitive to get into). I'm going to be doibg some extracurricular activites which I feel are relevant to teaching (e.g Edmund Rice Camps leader, Walgett trip to help at a school there). So my question is, is there high school teachers out there who can give some advice to a naive, inexperienced 16 year old who is really unsure of what he wants to do? Cheers Reddit!</TEXT>

So my question is, is there high school teachers out there who can give some advice to a naive, inexperienced 16 year old who is really unsure of what he wants to do? Cheers Reddit!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[AUS] Aussie HS student interested in accounting</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-06-05 13:29:27</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm currently exploring career options and I've been thinking about a career in accounting. I'm in Year 11 in NSW (penultimate year of high school). Some of the reasons why I've considered a career are below: + I have a real interest in business, economics and commercial law. I really love the whole nitty gritty of commerce. + I value stability and career progression (this is probably something to do with my Generation Z as we grow up in the GFC which made us more conservative and risk adverse). + I'm not too interested in money but I want to have enough to have a comfortable lifestyle and self fund my retirement. Not so sure if I want to have kids and I'd ideally like to have a DINKS household tbh. + I'd ideally like to use my accounting experience to leapboard into some sort of management or finance role and accounting seems like a greater step to other careers. Some of the reasons I'm hesitant towards considering accounting are: + In Australia, we have a massive oversupply of pretty much everything (including accounting grads). I feel I can be competitive for a grad role but I feel as if a lot of it is due to luck and it feels as if you don't get a internship, you don't get a job. + I've heard accounting being boring, soul sucking, routine and likely to be automated in the future. Any thoughts on this? + I'm worried about being stuck in some sort of dead end, accounting clerk role doing someone's taxes. So, do you feel as if I'm just being paranoid about accounting? Do you see accounting as being a good career in Australia and around the world in the future? Also, does anyone have any idea about accounting cadetships in Australia? Thank you /r/accounting!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, of course. Forwards and goalkeepers are the most pressure in football. A forward can play badly the whole game and score the winner in stoppage time and people would say 'he played well'. A goalkeeper can be a wall the whole game, pulling off multiple shots but they make one silly mistake in the last minute which leads to the other team winning, people would say 'that keeper played like shit' Goalkeepers have their work cut out for them. :P</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm really sorry to hear that mate. Probably the worst thing about public speaking is the anxiety before you go on stage. Once you're speaking, it tends to be fine and adrenaline takes over to a degree. If you're worried about making a mistake, just practice. Even then, if you do make a mistake, just remember that most people won't notice. If they do notice, they're probably won't care. The best public speakers in the world make mistakes all the time. Watch Obama's speeches when he was President, he would often say the wrong thing but would laugh it off. Just don't take it so seriously even if it is. The audience will be better able to relate and identify with you if you do. Maybe take some drama improvisation classes if you can. These will really help you think quick on your feet and come up with good responses fast.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2017-09-25 07:45:01</DATE>
    <TEXT>Commonwealth countries (such as the UK and Australia) seem to define the middle class differently to you Americans. For us, the most common defintion is the professional-managerial class of society who work in the professions and are college educated. For Americans, you seem to define the middle class on the basis of income. This means that workers who would we would lump into the middle class (e.g trades, factory workers, coal miners) but earn enough money are classed in the American middle class. So can anyone explain to me like I'm 5 why Americans do this?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Millennials are sure as hell not 'less materialistic' then other generations. You're talking about post-millennials 'Gen Z'. Millennials are the children of the Boomers and as a result, share a lot of the similar characteristics. The problem with the Millennials is that they learned a lot of Boomer traits of their parents but have not been afforded the same economic opportunities as their parents where. Gen Y and the Boomers are surprisingly some of the most liberal of generations. However, both are incredibly materialistic whilst being socially progressive. Gen Z, the post-millennials, grew up post 2001, post GFC. As a result of this chaotic and traumatic world which they grew up in, they tend to prize stability more then the Boomers and Gen Y do. Gen Z are more interested in work being a means to a (hopefully) stable end whereas Gen Y, Boomers see work as being an essential part of their identity as an individual. Gen Z will take many things for granted having grew up with a black President and in a country with a growing awareness of social rights (e.g legalization of same sex marriage) and as a result, will not be as socially progressive as their preceding generations.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Are unemployed Australians really going for the same jobs as newly arrived migrants who can barely speak English? People have a weird relationship with the government. On one hand, they hate it and moan about government interference in their lives and on the other, they complain that the government isn't solving all their problems for them. The funny thing with immigration of these low skilled migrants is that they are often unable to find employment. Funny that. They set up businesses and they employ more people. If you are competing for jobs against low skilled immigrants, that is your fault and your fault alone. Do not blame the government, do not blame immigrants for your laziness and unwillingness to not adapt.</TEXT>

Although I understand this might have been hyoerbole, I seriously doubt these migrants with very good English are going after these bottom level, illegal jobs.

And if anyone has any idea how businesses tend to hire, there is a bias against migrant workers and this is only going to get worse because of the blatant rascism on show today.

    <TEXT>Bullshit. Stop exhibiting racism. Do you even know how hard it is for any immigrants to get a job in this country? It's bloody hard because of backwards, "jobs for the white boys" attitude that this country enjoys. During your degree, did you actually do anything apart from attend lectures? Did you go to any networking events? Internships (even unpaid)? Any volunteering related to accounting for non for profits? Any involvement in societies? But instead you are not taking any responsiblity for your own failings but instead blame the government for your problems.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>1. House Captain = leader of a house. "In a British school, a house is a group of children of different ages who compete against other groups in sports and other activities. Each house usually has a name." Our school has four houses. House captains are chosen from the prefects and I basically got the role because no one else wanted to be house captain and was in the same house as me from the prefect group. Prefect = senior student leadership group for the school. Made up of 16 students from Year 12 who also are given additional portfolio responsibilities. i.e I'm one of the Prefects responsible for the Literacy and Academia portfolio. We run stuff like maths week and spelling bees. Prefects are elected by ballot by both teachers and students at the end of Year 11. 2. The place was a pizza shop and a cafe. I mainly was a busboy and cleared tables, cleaned, and served meals and drinks. I didn't make any food or drinks and did not serve people at the till. People would ask me for stuff whilst I was clearing tables. Customers weren't really difficult. Worked under a lot of pressure. I was the place's dishwasher as well. Worked in a team and would sometimes make the pizzas as well but I didn't really like that as the pizza shop area was really hot. 3. It's an internship working for an MP (not going to say whether it's state or federal or what house it is). I haven't even started haha (starting next week). But as I'm preparing the resume for when applications are starting in March to September (which is like cadet recruitment season). 6. ADF is Australian Defence Force. Award is awarded to one Year 10 student each year in my school. There is like 200 people in Year 10. https://www.adflongtanawards.gov.au/ I started a social justice advocacy group for the school called the Peace Group which kinda died but I was the student organizer for it. Before becoming a Prefect and House Captain, I was a College Leader which is like a junior prefect role.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm very sorry for your loss. On the brightside, you're still only 21 so you have the whole world and your whole life ahead of you. Have you considered working in social work or nursing as a career? You could try and get some certs in community services and go from there. Demand for aides is pretty high (which may not what you want to do after all this) but it's pretty crap work for shitty pay but you could use it as a leap board into other careers. A big baby? How many 21 years old have cared for their sick mother for the past 4 years? Hell, most 21 year olds pretty much fluff around in uni for 4 years anyway lol. So I don't feel as if you're that behind the curve in that respect.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Is monarchism right wing?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-03-09 10:46:54</DATE>
    <TEXT>I found this subreddit from a link on /r/Conservative. I'm an Australian liberal (liberal in the American way) who supports the constitutional monarchy of Australia and the UK. Is monarchism really a right wing ideology? The democratic socialists of the UK Labour Party who built one of the greatest social democratic welfare states of all time, Clement Attlee and Ernst Bevin, were strong supporters of the monarchy. Around the same tie, the Royal Family were popular with the British working class during George V and the Queen's father, George VI because they were likable and were able to connect with the modern man. I disagree with the American dichotomy of intense focus on social issues at the expense of all else. Denouncing feminists and pro-choice activists as 'leftists' cheapens the word and shifts it away from it's original meaning. This is why I feel as if monarchism is labelled as a right wing ideology due to the American hyperfocus on social issues. Sorry if it's not very well thought out but these are my thoughts!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Compared to actual cases of real inequality, it's really a non issue. The Queen has been great as she demonstrates the commitment to the community which what I'm all about. Giving the lower and middle classes the tools and opportunities to succeed in a capitalist society is what I desire. I don't want to tear down the 'capitalist machine' but I want to make sure that the system works for the little people as well. I'm not really a social democrat or a socialist, Im a middle of the road social liberal who emphasizes the role of the state in providing public goods and regulating markets so that the ordinary person doesn't get screwed (see Martin Shkreli). I believe that Australia is the perfect nation. A parliamentary democracy with a nonpartisan monarch represented through a governor general who in theory acts on the advice of the Prime Minister ensures We have low tax burdens (amazingly, the US has a higher tax burden then us but we provide much better government services), an attractive destination to do business (massive growth area for finance, highest growing place for fintech in the world, booming mining sector, strong services sector). We also provide affordable education to people (even though they have to pay for it, it's not that high and you only pay when you're earning enough money) and a good, efficent public health care system which isn't bloated by corporations like the American healthcare system or bloated by bureaucrats as in the NHS.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In its current form in the US, yes, I agree with you there. But Antifa is a very long and varied tradition which has enjoyed support from people across the polticial spectrum. Groups such Anti-Fascist Action in the UK ensured that the British National Party and the National Front's influence was contained. Although we who are not part of the far left may not see eye to eye with Antifa, we should be sympathetic towards their goals as fascism and totiltiariansm is the common enemy that liberals, conservatives, libertarians and others should all fight against.</TEXT>

How Muslims have Zakat, requiring them to give a certain percentage of their income to charity? You can go on about how religion causes division. Everything causes division. If there was no religion, people would have wars about what colour their hair is. Religious wars are rarely about religion as well but mere excuses for greed and imperialism. E.g Iraq, the Crusades..... Mormons have done good work as well but they are a religion which is on the fringes of contemporary religious thought. I would never, ever take Mormonism as an example of what organized religion is. For every person that has been victimised by organized religion, hundreds more have benefitted positively in their lives.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The American definition of socialism is so frustrating. Surely if we take their definition America has large amounts of 'socialism' due to the massive role of the state, especially with the military-industrial complex?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Universal public healthcare is always being called socialist (which is what it's described by American liberals a lot of the time as well) even in any other country but the United States, it is not even a discussion point.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Pretty much, that sounds really stupid to say but I imagine a lot of people would be the same. If we ever do have another war, it will be the professional force that goes anyway.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm up for national service but the use of conscripts in actual wars is a bad idea. I just feel if we had some sort of forced service which would really be a glorified arm of the education system to be honest it would be great for the country. Also disclaimer, I'm Australian but a UK citizen as well</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Surely you could say the same thing about compulsory education with the same argument? The state is forcing you to do an activity. Maybe not so much for the UK but in the US, does the state forcing you to complete all your taxes count as forced labour?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm trying to be non-political here. The major issue conservatives have is that when someone immediately brings up concentration camps immediately images are brought to mind of the atrocities committed by the Nazis during the Holocaust. That's why it's such a politically charged term and has sort of lost it's meaning over the years. If we look at Wikipedia's definition, a concentration camp is a place for 'the confinement or imprisonment of large groups of people without trial'. The current 'shelters' confine large groups of people without trial. This is indisputable and is unpolitical. The Australian immigration detention centres, the UK immigration detention centres can also be considered as concentration camps under this meaning. Guantanamo Bay could be considered a concentration camp however it didn't hold large numbers of people but it did hold them without trial.</TEXT>
