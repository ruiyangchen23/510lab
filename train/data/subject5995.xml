    <TITLE>Cho Cho is a terrible character</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-08-27 16:06:11</DATE>
    <TEXT>I don't know about you guys, but the past few episodes have been the best episodes of the Boruto series so far. Excluding of course Cho Cho, she might be one of the most aggravating characters in the show. At first in the first few episode it was cute and funny, she was the opposite of her father, as she's an extrovert and thinks of herself as the most beautiful girl in the world. Cool. But now she's so fucking annoying, she's just getting in the way of the shows progression each and every time she's given any time on screen. IDK ITS JUST KINDA ANNOYING HAVING HER BE LIKE: "OMG I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT MY DAD IS SOOOOOOOOOOO NOT MY DAD, SO I'M GONNA GO FIND MY REAL DAD WHO TOTALLY ISN'T CHOJI BUT SKINNY IN THE DREAM SEQUENCE". I might be taking this too seriously. Edit: I get that there's a need for a comedic effect to break the tension of scenes, but after the first or second time, the exact same joke just makes the character repetitive opposed to funny. I also get that there's always a character who's the non-serious funny guy, and I know that they're trying to make (Chocho?) that character. Naruto was it in the original series, and the reason I liked him being said character is because he was never written in a completely repetitive and boring way, all of his comedic squawks were nicely put into scenes, and made since with the storyline at said time. (ChouChou?) is currently just a side character that doesn't bring much to the table other than comedic relief, and not a good one at that. Maybe if there's a InoShikaCho character arc there can be more story and enlightenment to the character, but with how early it is in the series it's hard to say if she's even going to be a good candidate for a solo episode. TL;DR Cho Cho? Chocho? Chou Chou? ChouChou?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So here's what we use in Speedruns, built to be as OP as possible  gt;Mass Effect 1 Liara and Kaiden because they do the most damage due to biotics being overpowered in ME1. We also use Vanguard for the same reason.  gt;Mass Effect 2 Mordin and Miranda offer the best powers and abilities to take down Shields, Armor, and Health as quickly as possible. Vanguard for charge.  gt;Mass Effect 3 James/EDI and Liara for the same reasons as ME2. Vanguard for charge.  gt;Mass Effect: Andromeda It couldn't matter less what squadmate you take, they're all useless. Vanguard for charge.  gt;Personal Favorites I have a thing for Garrus and Tali, they're great characters.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The rest *should*(Depends on OP) be released in the next few months, maybe weeks. Kloggmankey is doing this in his free time between college courses, so it isn't a regular release kind of thing. Although he has been making more episodes recently. If you really need more Kai, there's a [cut to manga](https://cuttomangaanime.blogspot.com/2017/08/naruto-cut-to-manga.html) version here. I believe it's finished, but the overall quality isn't nearly as good as the one here.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes, most definitely. They're some of the better books I've "read" in the past decade. I really recommend the audio books for them, the production quality is crazy good. Here's my personal favorites: - Lost Stars - The reign of the Galactic Empire has reached the Outer Rim planet of Jelucan, where aristocratic Thane Kyrell and rural villager Ciena Ree bond over their love of flying. Enrolling at the Imperial Academy together to become fighter pilots for the glorious Empire. - Thrawn - Timothy Zahn chronicles the fateful events that launched the blue-skinned, red-eyed master of military strategy and lethal warfare into the highest realms of power #8212;and infamy. - Aftermath(Trilogy) - Trapped on an isolated world, a desperate group of rebels is all that stands between the galaxy's freedom and the Empire's fury. - Phasma - Deep inside the Battlecruiser Absolution, a captured Resistance spy endures brutal interrogation at the hands of a crimson-armored stormtrooper #8212;Cardinal. But the information he desires has nothing to do with the Resistance or its covert operations against the First Order. What the mysterious stormtrooper wants is Phasma's past #8212;and with it whatever long-buried scandal, treachery, or private demons he can wield against the hated rival who threatens his own power and privilege in the ranks of the First Order.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I decided to take some time out of my week to edit together the anime adaptations of the Lite Novels(which take place after The Last), so if you wanna check them out I have them uploaded here: Sasuke's Story: Book of Sunrise [MEGA](https://mega.nz/#!pfonRIJJ!n2f94xLQdHa4HnRItSJXGNyAaEixE7Q6NNftt155XZY) Shikamaru's Story: A Cloud Drifting in the Silent Dark [MEGA](https://mega.nz/#!sb4nwSLT!DrXS47V2K9FGBQZb_c96Yw7y7yHpjz0zvQcjhhAOwcw) Hidden Leaf's Story: The Perfect day for a Wedding [MEGA](https://mega.nz/#!FbgTmQgJ!94qIXq2Y-or8jJNW5CZeBVfzxDYuqRD66gHNAdAL_ao) For the most part they really didn't need to be edited down, all I did was get rid of intros/outros, any unnecessary transitions(if possible), and useless scenes that are only there to pad for time. For Sasuke's, and Shikamaru's stories, I just used Kissanime's 720p copies, and for Hidden Leaf's I used HorribleSubs' 1080p MKV files from nyaa.si, I don't really know Japanese so I guess these are good translations, but I'm not really one to say. I'm trying to figure out torrents, but I've been having some trouble so far. Once I figure it out I'll add torrent links.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If you end up liking them, would you consider adding them to the post? I especially think that The Perfect Day for a Wedding is a really nice, lighthearted send-off for the series. But the other two books were really good arcs, and it would be cool for more people to actually see them; because from what I understand they were kind of put off by a lot of people because they thought the series ended with the War arc. In any case, thanks for the easy way of watching this show, I remember having to wait each week for sadly, yet another filler episode, and this whole thing has been really nice to just sit down and watch.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>After you finish watching the 72 episodes that Klogg is *almost* finished releasing, watch "[The Last: Naruto the Movie](http://kissanime.ru/Anime/Naruto-Shippuuden-Movie-7-The-Last/Episode-1080p?id=113129 amp;s=rapidvideo)" as it continues the story, then continue on with the [Anime Adaptaions of the Lite Novels made for the series](https://www.reddit.com/r/Naruto/comments/8x9dw5/naruto_kai_the_lite_novels/) (This includes Naruto's wedding for example[I'm the one who edited these]), which take place after The Last. Then just start watching Boruto, because it covers both of the items listed in the post. The Omake they cover in a filler episode pretty early on, and they just finished the Chunin exam arc, which is what Boruto: The Movie covers. I hope that summed it up.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is the reason why partnered discord servers *shouldn't* have NSFW channels, people won't follow the rules, and your server will be unpartnered. It's the reason why the /r/pcmasterrace mods chose to remove their NSFW channel, because it was too high of a risk for the server. Moral of this story is that you shouldn't have had that channel on your partnered server, and it's your fault for not realizing how big of a risk it was.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>When you have a server that has thousands of people on it(which I assume this one does), having a channel like that is just an unnecessary risk that they now have to deal with the consequences of. I'm all for NSFW channels if the server is small, or it's a dedicated server for just that, but it's a server dedicated to the game Final Fantasy, of which doesn't include anything like that. I understand that there's probably a mod team who's making sure that any content depicting Lolicon gets deleted, but some times people just make mistakes and something might get through, and this time it did. Downvote me all you guys want, but it was a mistake for a partnered server to have an NSFW channel, and unfortunately won't be getting back said partnership. I know it was just an honest mistake, but it's an unfortunate truth that it shouldn't have happened anyway.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's an unnecessary risk to have an NSFW channel anyway, someone might post CP or Lolicon, both obviously against TOS, and a moderator might miss it. It's an honest mistake, but it's still a failure on the mod team, I understand that they're working as hard as they can to make sure that kind of stuff doesn't get through, but that's what happened. I don't think they should have had their partnership taken away, it was harsh of them to not even give the mod team a warning. But having the channel in the first place was a bad idea.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's been a wild ride Kloggmankey, you're awesome for finishing this project! Here's just a little guide for people who wanna watch what comes after the main series. 1. [Naruto Kai](https://www.reddit.com/r/Naruto/comments/91wdjv/naruto_kai_ultimate_subbed_edition/) (Watch this first, obviously) 2. [The Last: Naruto the Movie](https://mega.nz/#!iqBmEALB!AoVhvl_BdVWp_42gaVN9Z0EvQwX-EGOM6TZwXLz63eQ) (Takes place after the main series) 3. [Anime adaptations of the Light Novels](https://www.reddit.com/r/Naruto/comments/8x9dw5/naruto_kai_the_lite_novels/) (Takes place after The Last) 4. [Boruto: Naruto The Next Generations](http://www.crunchyroll.com/boruto-naruto-next-generations) (Boruto's Dad's Kid's Show) Make sure to not watch the Boruto movie if you plan on watching the series, because the anime covers everything from the movie, but with better animations(at times), and much more in depth.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>While I agree that the company is very different from how it was, they've grown in ways that nobody would have imagined. They have a new show coming out in January that has [David Tennant](https://twitter.com/RoosterTeeth/status/1022980451777093632) and [Michael B Jordan](https://www.instagram.com/p/BjDqRwAB7ib/?taken-by=michaelbjordan) announced as some of the cast for the show. Not to mention that they have another show coming out that's being produced by [Rob McElhenney](https://variety.com/2018/digital/news/rooster-teeth-rob-mcelhenney-orders-animated-horror-comedy-series-1202814177/), the dude who acted in and wrote for Always Sunny. I do understand that they aren't the same company they used to be, but it's for the better really. If you want something that's still "Old-Roosterteeth", I would recommend the RT Podcast, or Off-Topic. It's just their personalities and stories of theirs, nothing but them talking for a few hours.</TEXT>

It's the same reason why cat-calling a girl on the street isn't something you should do, because the compliment isn't something she wants.

    <TEXT>The way this works, is once you've taken enough fall damage to reach 0HP(You can't die from it in this game), you go into a state where you can't take any damage from anything in the game for a few seconds. If your shields are able to recharge at this point then you'll be able to reach "Deadman" state. In this state, you won't take any damage, although it wares off after the first bit of damage that you take, and you [regain all of your health at once](https://streamable.com/u6pmu). Unfortunately this doesn't really have any use in the speedrun of the game, because for the most part we just run through things as fast as possible and don't really die anyway, but it's interesting enough that I thought I would share my findings.</TEXT>
