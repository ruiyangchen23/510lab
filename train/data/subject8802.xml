    <TEXT>hi im a physics enthusiast , and im just curious about things in general let me ask you this... how can they state that entangled particles , even if light years apart , change properties immediatly to match one to another ? how is this tried out ? how can you put one of the pair light years away from the other ? or is this all theoretical physics , and not experimental !? how do they reproduce this phenomena ?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>a survival zombie game where you can drop items magicaly from the air is so ridiculous , lol .... no storyline , no goals (except to kos) , the zombies are ridiculous , they are not part of the game , and you expect this game to last ? ... you really outdid yourselves SOE ... warz with a different game engine ... and you have to pay to early access , nevertheless they push to sell you crates in a alpha game ? are you supposed to be helping them with the development , oh but that wont be on the way of SOE making a buck up until release .... ridiculous</TEXT>

    <DATE>2016-02-13 15:49:14</DATE>
    <TEXT>i would appreciate an official response from ubisoft , since i believe the most hindering feature on this game is the low tickrate it holds ... you might say 120 tickrate isnt a must for consoles , but a pc first person shooter with 60 tickrate ? a higher tickrate would only be beneficial .. is this something we , pc players , might have a chance of getting in the future ? i understand there might be other priorities at the moment , but a crisp responsive first person shooter is all we want .... i expect most of the hit register issues would be less if the game was on a higher tick ... thank you for your work !</TEXT>

    <TEXT>4 years ago i bought a license key for power director 12 deluxe from a retailer and i registered it in the cyberlink site .... meanwhile , years passed , my ssd and my hdd broke down on the same week and i lost everything i had installed ... a few months later when i went to cyberlink site to download powr director 12 , i couldnt find it anywhere , i could find my licensed cd key with ease , but no download link for the software anywhere .... i decided ill send an email to them asking for a legit copy of the software i own a license . they said they discontinued power director 12 and i had to buy an upgrade ... i was very disapointed , i explained my case , and after a few emails they asked me for a receipt of the purchase .... i could not find it , but since i had my key registered to my email on their website i thought i would be enough .... well it isnt , they say i HAVE TO UPGRADE ... tl;dr does anyone know where i could find a copy of power director 12 deluxe , i own a key , but i cant find a copy anywhere (except for the ones reeking of worms) thank you</TEXT>

    <TEXT>did you even watch the episodes ? This causes his Sage Mode form to make him more toad-like in appearance, such as warts and webbed hands and feet; although his frog-like legs enable him to jump better, he dislikes the overall appearance because he believes women will find it unattractive. Using Sage Mode requires his supply of natural energy be constantly replenished, something that is difficult to do while in combat. For this reason, Jiraiya summons Fukasaku and Shima and fuses them to his body, having them gather natural energy for him. did you see naruto summon fukasaku or shima and fuse with them ?</TEXT>

Like Naruto, Konohamaru tends to be loud, headstrong, spends an inordinate amount of time inventing perverted ninjutsu, and, in the anime, even mimics Naruto's kabuki ninja registration photograph when taking his own.[8] He also ends many of his sentences with "kore" ( #12467; #12524;, Literally meaning: "hey", "oi", "yo"), much like Naruto does with "dattebayo".</TEXT>

    <TEXT>still active , small but active communitty , expect very skilled players when you arrive .... be patient , quakelive is a very hard game to master ... very easy to find clan arena games especially . if you get in to 1 v 1 , you need to get your skills up before you can find opponents , since they refuse to play noobs mostly ..... worth buying ? imo its still the best arena fps ever made</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; Naruto has incredible Chakra which is a trait of the Uzumaki. do we know of any namikaze traits ? who says they didnt have huge chakra reserves ? minato sure had a lot of chakra aswell , and also sealing skills ....  gt; Also why wouldn't he be both? Every human gets traits from both sides of their family. So he is an Uzumaki and a Namikaze. he should be a namikaze by name ....  gt; And Mirai is also part yuhi and part sarutobi. but her name is sarutobi , not yuhi , that is my point</TEXT>

    <TEXT>what i fail to understand is why do we need a PTS server ... the main goal of a PTS server is to prevent breaking the normal servers when you introduce changes. but that only makes sense if you have a "public" build that is worth "protecting" from the incoming builds , which is not the case .... the PTS server is there to test stuff before it is sent to the other test server ? it makes no sense .... theres nothing to be broken in the normal servers , why do we need a PTS server ? the normal servers should be the PTS servers until the game gets fully released , and you have all the active ladders/ranked games that need to be protected from incoming updates, that could break the game entirely , rendering the ranked play unplayable ... the PTS is a welcome feature , but right now its useless and only serves to further separate the communitty ....</TEXT>

    <TEXT>this is what BSG told me to do : Please see below a list of possible solutions, and try running the launcher after each of them: - Run the launcher as administrator; - Temporarily turn off all antivirus and security programs, such as Windows Defender; - Try updating the Microsoft .NET Framework (Windows 7, 8, 8.1): https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/framework; - Reinstall the launcher and the game. - Try to change the place to install the game from one disc to another. - Try to create an additional account in your OS and try to run the game through it. - Try to delete the folder cache in the folder with the game, and then find the folder on your computer % temp% and remove everything from there altogether (if something is not deleted, then just skip it removal). - Try for the game folder and for the launcher folder to set full rights for the current user (folder properties, the "Security" tab). - Try disabling Real-time Protection in the Windows 10 Security Center. These are routine preventive actions that can #8217;t damage your PC.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>ven with an install to an SSD hard drive, and a PC that can run Witcher 3 at 60 FPS with no problems, in this game with most graphics options tuned down and anti-aliasing completely disabled the game still stutters and drops frames all the time. Reaches 60 FPS @ 1080p only occasionally and whenever the game is loading anything (which is frequently given the nature of the game world), below 10 FPS is the norm. Game also has audio issues and crashes. The game promises a lot of variety, but most of it is utterly cosmetic and based on simply restructuring of a very limited number of base components in the same way that a lottery has millions of combinations but only 30 numbers. Combat is not worth mentioning, FPS and space simulators both from 20 years ago did those better. Travel to a planet - mine resources - craft items or sell resources for cash - purchase a new ship. Maybe if you're interested try to follow the learn an alien language one word at a time. Repeat until boredom and switch to a better game.</TEXT>
