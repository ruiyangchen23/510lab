    <TEXT> gt; Words have no meaning anymore I suppose Words indeed only have whatever meaning people assign to them. That's semiotics 101. Now to [quote](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/pc/250533-deus-ex/faqs/51057) from the French resistance group *Silhouette* from the game *Deus Ex* (the first one, of course):  gt;This war all around us is being fought over the very meanings of words.  gt;Just as [Bakhtin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bakhtin) described the novel as a competition between various "languages," so we describe culture itself, which thrives upon convulsion and upheaval.  gt;Meaning does not exist a priori. It is order imposed by individuals with arsenals of communication devices.  gt;Every inscription, every utterance, every gesture seeks to dominate the plain of meaning. Which is precisely what Cezary Baginski and the replies are doing: defining the meaning of the word *liberty* to suit their agenda.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;For decades, far-right extremists have marched through Wunsiedel in Bavaria every year, to the despair of those who live there. This year, the organisers of Rechts gegen Rechts (Right against Right) took a different approach.  gt;Without the marchers #8217; knowledge, local residents and businesses sponsored the 250 participants of the march on 15 November in what was dubbed Germany #8217;s  #8220;most involuntary walkathon #8221;. For every metre they walked,  #8364;10 went to a programme called EXIT Deutschland, which helps people escape extremist groups.  gt;Campaigners hung humorous posters to make the march look more like a sporting event, with slogans such as  #8220;If only the F #252;hrer knew! #8221; and  #8220;Mein Mampf #8221; (my munch) next to a table laden with bananas.

    <TEXT> gt;A 2008 series of studies from the Harvard Kennedy School #8217;s Women and Public Policy Program found that displays of anger from men in professional contexts are often viewed as responses to external circumstances, while the same from women are seen as representations of their personality. Not counting the rabid fanboys I'm pretty sure Musk's Twitter meltdowns were wholly blamed on his personality, not external circumstances.  gt;But other stories viewed Mayer #8217;s decision through the lens of her gender; Mayer, some critics believed, had picked being an executive over a woman.  #8220;I #8217;d thought that while she was breaking some barriers #8212;becoming the youngest woman CEO ever to lead a Fortune 500 company, and certainly the first to do it while pregnant #8212;she might take on the challenge of breaking a number of others, #8221; Lisa Belkin wrote in HuffPost.  #8220;That she #8217;d use her platform and her power to make Yahoo an example of a modern family-friendly workplace. #8221; 1. claim that with women CEO's companies will be less evil. 2. when this turns out not to be the case, criticize the critics of making it about her gender  gt;If a female CEO of a major tech company had teared up to reporters, would she have been seen as  #8220;vulnerable, #8221; as the Times put it, or weak? [This article definitely doesn't consider Musk's tears to be a sign of "vulnerability"](https://www.business-standard.com/article/international/why-elon-musk-seems-to-be-asking-for-somebody-else-to-don-the-tesla-ceo-hat-118081800643_1.html):  gt;Last night The New York Times published an unsettling interview with him in which he teared up about the pressure of being Tesla #8217;s CEO. Matt Levine writes Musk has accidentally stumbled on the simplest solution to Tesla #8217;s problems: Just let somebody else be CEO!</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;mauraders https://www.overdrive.com/media/3879613/trigger-warning  gt;A short, sharp cry in the night made Jake Rivers look up from the book he was reading.  gt;To be honest, he was glad for the distraction. He was on the verge of throwing the book against the wall of his dorm room in disgust. Since it was a hard copy, a thick trade paperback bought in the university bookstore for an outrageous price, and not something he was reading on his phone or tablet, he could have done that without breaking anything. Although the book was heavy enough it might have dented the Sheetrock. #  gt;"An-ti-fa! An-ti-fa!"  gt;The chanting made him look around. He frowned as he saw that the commotion had attracted several dozen students. His frown deepened as he realized they were cheering on the black-clad attackers.  gt;"Wait a minute!" he shouted, knowing he was wasting his time but too angry right now to care. "I didn't do anything wrong! I was just trying to help a woman-"  gt;"Toxic! Toxic!"  gt;"Racist!"  gt;"Nazi! Nazi!"  gt;...  gt;Then the memories went back even further to old, grainy, historical newsreel footage he had seen, row upon row of young men in spiffy uniforms and high black boots marching through the streets of a city, lifting their arms in a salute to the madman in front of them...  gt;And the mass graves and the smoke rising from the crematoriums and later an even worse evil rising in the East, with more millions dead for no reason other than opposing what the party leaders said and did...  gt;And these people surrounding him now, the bullies in their black hoods and the ones who chanted for them, believed in and supported that hideous evil, all while calling *him* a Nazi and a fascist...  gt;They kept using those words, but he didn't believe the words meant what these people thought they did. #  gt;"Female students."  gt;"All students. Not everyone accepts the antiquated concept of binary gender, you know. Remember LGGBDTTTIQQAAPP. That means-"  gt;Jake held up a hand to stop him.  gt;"That's all right. I don't need it defined. But I thought it was LGBTQIAPK."  gt;Montambault blew out a scoffing breath.  gt;"That's outdated. The college experience is a very fast-paced one these days."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Some writers are prolific. And some must use a dozen or so assistants: https://www.bookseriesinorder.com/j-a-johnstone/ Behold: **Black Friday**  gt;Black Friday. The American Way Mall is packed with holiday shoppers and bargain seekers. Machine-gun fire rings out, and within minutes hundreds are dead and dying. Others are taken hostage by an army of fanatical Middle Eastern terrorists ready to blast the American Way Mall into a pile of rubble. But one man #8212;Iraq War vet Tobey Lanning #8212;refuses to go down without a fight. Separated from his soon-to-be fianc #233;e, Lanning finds himself on the frontlines of a new war against terror. The FBI and the local police are helpless. The battle is going to be lost or won inside the mall. With thousands of innocent lives at stake, Lanning assembles a makeshift platoon of Black Friday shoppers. A teenage security guard. A retired Chicago cop. A school teacher who #8217;s never fired a gun. A young ex-con who has. A soccer mom. A priest. A wheelchair-bound WWII vet . . .  gt;These brave everyday Americans will stand up and meet the enemy face to face. Defend their land, their values, their honor #8212;and if necessary pay the ultimate price for freedom . . . **Tyranny**  gt;G.W. Brannock is proud to be a rancher, a West Texan, and a American. The land he owns has been in his family for generations. But when the IRS claims he owes a fortune in back taxes #8212;and some stiffs from the Bureau of Land Management tell him his family #8217;s deed is invalid #8212;G.W. refuses to stand down. This land is his land, and there #8217;s only one way the government can take it: over his dead body #8230;  gt;The battle lines are drawn. The feds hit G.W. with everything they #8217;ve got, from legal threats to sabotage to hired thugs. All G.W. #8217;s got is his grandson Kyle and fiesty lawyer Miranda Stephens. But when his story makes the national news, a veritable army of ordinary citizens rises up and rushes to West Texas. To join the cause. To fight against tyranny. To live free or die #8230;  gt;The battle lines are drawn. The next civil war is about to begin. **Stand your Ground**  gt;After the President closes Guantanamo Bay to hold civilian trials for the terrorists, some of them are relocated to Hell's Gate Prison in West Texas. Until a group of fanatical sleeper-cell shock troops launch an all-out assault to "liberate" their jailed comrades. There's just one problem: they don't know that Army Ranger Lucas Kincaid is working at Hell's Gate.  gt;With the town's high school team held hostage and in danger of being executed one by one, Kincaid assembles a ragtag band of survivors and aging hardcore cons into a lethal fighting force to keep the unholy warriors from their deadly mission. And Kincaid and his men are on their own--everyone, from the President on down, orders Kincaid to give in to the terrorists' demands.  gt;But warrior Lucas Kincaid, out-numbered and out-gunned, won't back down.  gt;One thing's for sure: when the enemy gets to Hell, they'll know America sent them. **Suicide Mission**  gt;Former CIA agent and soldier of fortune "Wild Bill" Elliott thought he was done with impossible missions. But that was before a group of **Islamic fanatics teamed up with a Mexican drug cartel to establish a terrorist training camp on America's southern border**--and Elliot is tapped by the government to wipe out their base.  gt;To do this Elliott recruits a squad of hardened lifers plucked out of the U.S. maximum security prisons--a terrifying collection of brutal killers, armed robbers, and savage felons, convicts so out of control they could blow up the mission at any moment. Whipping this ragtag bunch into an assault force capable of infiltrating the terrorist deathtrap will be the greatest challenge Elliott's ever faced. Getting them out alive? That could be a problem. . . **Home Invasion**  gt;They Will Invade Your Home.  gt;Home, Texas. Two men break into the house of an elderly couple. Guns are fired. Blood is spilled. When one of the intruders sues the homeowner and wins, the good people of Home take the law into their own hands. In a stunning case of backward justice fueled by the liberal media--the left-leaning U.S. President decides to make the town a test case to strike down the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution: Ban all guns in Home, Texas. And to enforce it, the newly formed national police force is sent in.  gt;They Will Take Your Weapons.  gt;Unarmed. Defenseless. Denied their civil right to bear arms, the citizens of Home are now easy targets for America's closest enemies--the Mexican drug cartels who spill across the border every day. This time, they've set their sights on a secret military arsenal. But they need a base of operations. And there's no place like Home.  gt;But They Won't Destroy Your Spirit.  gt;Police Chief Wade Bonner is one of the few in town permitted to carry a gun. But Bonner knows that his friends and neighbors will never surrender their freedoms--or submit to an outside enemy, no matter how strong or ruthless. Soon they will be put to the test. Because the war is coming home. And Home is fighting back. TL;DR: One book for each of the well-known right-wing grievances.</TEXT>

My ancestors were colonialists named Montambault who lived for a time in French Equatorial Africa before immigrating to this country. I simply adopted a more appropriate spelling to honor the unfortunate people they oppressed and exploited."

    <TEXT>No idea if this is legit, but it's funny. Go on Chapo!  gt;i used to work for tesla writing infotainment firmware and backend services - all of which runs in a single bottom tier Datacenter in a single location on the worst VMware deployment known to man.  gt;fun fact: a jenkins pipeline once caused almost the entire fleet to reboot loop for about an hour #  gt; gt;i ~~want~~ need to know more  gt;model s and x use openvpn to talk to their backend. inside that backend there are metadata services that feed info to the system, one of those things being a ~20MB+ (generated by the worst erp system) json payload that describes supercharger poo poo for the map in the touchscreen. somebody was smart enough to do automated linting but forgot to validate against the custom parser the car runs which caused a segfault in the qt app that runs the ui, which in turn for a variety of reasons forces a reboot of that component. I think we clocked about 15 seconds before it read the file and faulted after boot. it was doing that for an hour before everyone panicked and got me and qa on the phone to fix it. i wrote a quick python/fabric script that ssh #8217;d to as many cars as possible at a time to rm the file  gt;I #8217;ve got a few hundred stories like this #  gt; gt;why do the cars run a cluster of ubuntu vms?  gt;used to be centos 6 and Ruby on Rails. I haven #8217;t worked there in 3 years, but last I heard it hadn #8217;t changed much for s and x. model 3 uses newer tech, but still based out of a single Datacenter #  gt;some of what I wrote runs on the factory line - at the time we started the model s program, which has not changed to this day, we fake the backend to install and validate firmware as the car moves down the line. a tech runs over to the car, plugs an eth cable in diag and dumps an image on the car using curl and a tui app I wrote using python. as the car moves down the line it is installing firmware for about an hour. if that station for any reason can #8217;t talk to the PKI system, erp, or a ruby webapp it halts the line #  gt; gt;can't you flash the storage before its installed in a car?  gt;yes and no. the firmware update process in a car is complicated because you have a bunch of dumb components hanging off of CAN or LIN and they have to updated in very specific order and sometimes you have to retry 10s of times to get it to take. ( gently caress you Bosch). Tesla never bothered to flash those things ahead of time before assembly so that gets done the first time as it rolls down the line. the infotainment system and gateway arbitrate that stuff. typically any update that tuned voltages becomes a one way - no downgrade is possible without frying something #  gt; gt;this is the thing, like i work with boards that have many devices on them that have firmware and they're all flashed well before the board is installed in anything if not before even being soldered down  gt;they got smart eventually - model 3 does do this now, but doing that at scale with all the components for a car is a challenge when you have it being done with stations running yocto images and perl #  gt; gt;like, for all the lols @ tesla, have they literally never heard of a process engineer?  gt;**like everyone else who was smart they either quit or were fired through no fault of their own so what you #8217;re left with are people fearing for their job who desperately don #8217;t want to change status quo for fear it will break something** #  gt; gt;they forgot that the unspoken part of "move fast and break things" is that you're supposed to fix what's broken  gt;exactly this. we never really had time to address critical issues and were constantly short on staff because people were quitting or they just wouldn't give candidates competitive offers. this is why you hear about people burning out - they've managed to chase everyone away #  gt;more fun facts:  gt;the infotainment system and gateway don't have a battery-backed rtc. when the system reboots (sleep, deep sleep, reboot, whatever) the car is at tyool 1970 until it gets ntp again. the logs themselves are written in a binary ring buffer format and when they come in they used to end up in a giant 700TB single mysql database after they were expanded. all of production after-sales service and engineering relies on that single log interpretation system which ran on centos 5 and python 2.4 until hbase/hadoop and friends were brought in.  gt;the supercharger system uses ssh dss keys to "vpn" back to the datacenter to a single server over 2G wireless with very limited resources. the connection is essentially simplex for various reasons so getting data to and from the supercharger is usually a 1KB/s operation unless that site has had connection aggregation done. at one point i looked at the system and to pull data out for analysis, somebody had written a bash script that was printf'ing in a for loop across ~5k devices. it would usually take about 3 days to do a successful firmware update on any single supercharger.  gt;we once patched openssl to ignore client cert expiry because somebody forgot to create a process to update keys in the field and all the customer cars started falling offline because their certs had expired. the quick and dirty was to just patch openssl quickly and make openvpn on the server side use that one while we created those processes for about 2 weeks. #  gt; gt;With "no fault of their own" being the usual "proposing a process that isn't fragile and prone to error but will take longer than X promised to Y who promised it to Z and hurting the feelings of V and W, who are responsible for the monstrosity in the first place and have the ear of management"?  gt;yep that was 90% of it. most of the time me and the other firmware folks were chasing elon's whims about what to do with firmware. where i should have been fixing critical issues in the system i was pulled off to do poo poo like add farting unicorns #  gt; gt;uh we literally do the same thing; well, yocto images and python  gt; gt;tesla isn't the first to solder down SOMs running embedded linux and a bunch of MCUs hanging off an i2c/canbus/whatever line  gt;they aren't the first - for what we were doing at the time it made sense and helped us get the program off the ground quickly. lots of room for improvement and in 8 years, they should have done so.  gt;my issue was the fact that the systems doing the flashing were running the yocto images and perl and the guy writing the perl was also responsible for writing the thing that actually updates the car. that thing (the car-side updater) is about ~100k lines of C in a single file. code reviews were always a laugh riot #  gt; gt;2G is dead so i wonder what happened to cars that used that  gt;not sure. anything using the "old gateway" would need to be replaced - i brought that up years ago. roadster, supercharger and rav4 all used that standard (though toyota pulled all the wireless connectivity from the board later on, wisely) #  gt; gt;i am SO GLAD your nda expired  gt;99% of what i'm talking about is "public" anyway. tesla isn't encrypting their firmware and it's really easy to glean information from the vpn with a packet cap because nothing inside the vpn (was) encrypted. dumping tegra 3 model s and x is trivial and tesla's cars are nowhere near as secure as they'd have you believe.  gt;for example, at one time you were able to root a model s with a usb stick and a gstreamer exploit. #  gt;while tesla should be given credit for updating the car over the air to fix issues, that's also any connected car's biggest weakness - you're one exploit away (or malicious employee with access) from remote root.  gt;more fun stuff: there's limited space on the emmc in the touchscreen system so updating maps can't be done using an image or a binary diff. so the thing rsync's map updates (all 2GB of them) from various places. they may have fixed that in the newer intel-based boards, but who knows.  gt;autopilot had _really_ high turnover at one point before release because some guy from space x came in and gave the entire dept a C pointer/memory test because Elon said they were "late" to ship. #  gt; gt;There's the story online of that hacker who was pulling software images off through the door Ethernet port and found that his car's firmware was remotely downgraded after he uncovered and posted the first references to the P100 models.  gt; gt;Does that sound plausible to you?  gt;yup, i'm the guy that installed the older versions. this was a marketing mistake really. if i recall correctly, he ended up getting a marketing car or his car got tagged in the update system as a trusted car and he ended up getting pre-release stuff. this happened from time to time - sometimes marketing would sell off a car and the poo poo erp system wouldn't record the change. that car would then get prerelease and sometimes very broken firmware. i seem to recall another case where we just forgot to remove the prerelease materials from the official build, so all you had to do was look around. #  gt; gt;wait, do you mean the guy came in and cleaned out the department of people who couldn't pass his personal fizzbuzz pointer quiz?  gt;pretty much. many quit in protest of the test, others didn't pass because they were harness people working in cad programs and not actually programmers. even HR, who at the time was run by the worst conspirator rear end in a top hat ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnnon_Geshuri ) told him to can it before they sank the program</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; gt;are these all done over cellular? the network itself provides a lot of security in that case at least. of course until someone gets your password to control center/command center  gt;they're done over cell and wifi, depending on how big or urgent the update is. the network does generally provide security in the transport sense - the backend systems are what worry me and tesla is a big enough target that a determined actor could gain control. i can only guess how the likes of NIO (a chinese e-car startup) runs their backend. #  gt; gt;"We don't need QA/UAT, we just need to pound out a really insecure and buggy product! Jackpot!"  gt;we had firmware QA and they were great folks. for the lack of staff and timelines we had they were amazing people and the folks i worked directly with, save a few, were really talented. that said, it takes more than just firmware to QA something like a car that talks to a complex backend with continuous delivery into production #  gt;the early days of tesla, post-roadster, early model s and the start of model x were good times - everyone was trying to prove the technology worked, we were innovating and making something that hadn't been done before. things really started to poo poo the bed around the time we pivoted from model 3 plans to shipping model x first. the falcon wing doors were _such a shitshow_. they ended up delaying the program almost a year, hence why model 3 basically skipped all the usual phases a car goes through for validation. i mean, come on - you have bumpers falling off in the rain, the interior is a disaster, there's no instrument cluster which takes your eyes off the road - this list just goes on. #  gt;tesla basically runs their entire business like a just in time compiler only they don't treat warnings or errors as failures. most groups in the company don't cross-communicate so there's a lot of duplication of effort.  gt;i once got pulled into a meeting because a car burned down when it was attached to a supercharger and we didn't get a log out of the car. normally under some emergency circumstances the car will try to upload a log when it thinks poo poo has gone really badly, but in this particular case it was far enough away from a tower it had half 3G connection and had to upload a 30MB log via HTTPS POST. the car burned down before it even got to 10MB and the system was only designed for exponential backoff retries, not resumption of in-progress. elon was calm about it, but we had to justify why we never had time to address it - maybe it was because we were all busy making unsafe features work? #  gt;**also on the supercharger note - you can get blacklisted from using them if you charge on them all the time. that's because the supercharger bypasses the charging regulator boards and dumps directly into the pack at 300A/450v which creates a ton of wear on the battery. want to keep your range high? don't supercharge often.** #  gt; gt;do they define  #8220;too often #8221;?  gt;algorithm-based now - the ai poo poo i was working on took into account a lot of factors to determine if you were abusing it before i left. the criteria takes into account the state of many components in the car, your driving patterns and other details. or it did anyway. not even sure that stuff is running still - they rotated projects in and out of existence pretty rapidly. #  gt; gt;what is elon like when stuff goes wrong due to his idiotic micromanagement and big stupid ideas?  gt;he's never wrong. his "open door policy" was an invitation to catch you breaking rank. #  gt;tesla was also in the news because they were doing cute poo poo like spinning up k8s clusters which had AWS IAM access to sensitive S3 buckets but wasn't ssl'd and the k8s mgmt api was available publicly. there were other teams running industrial control equipment with centos 7 an no hardening at all.  gt;there was one time where a canadian kid stole the domain and redirected emails and managed to take over slack and a bunch of other poo poo because the idiot IT team didn't hide the registrar information or use something like markmonitor. the car-side stuff at least did full mtls at the time so it was ok, but lol did that kid get a lot of info. #  gt; gt;thats just what i want, the car manufacturer monitoring how i drive the car i own and deciding that features should be turned off after i have purchased it, that's a good feature.  gt;you have no idea. any connected car is ripe for data harvesting and you (the consumer) should expect it going forward. on that note, china has a law in place that mandates all electric cars send real time telemetry to their government servers - model s/x/3, NIO cars and any other electric car if they're driving already complies with that law to be road certified. don't be surprised if that becomes a mandate in other countries #  gt;for all the poo poo that went down at tesla, there were some positive aspects. everyone i worked with really cared about physical safety and we put a lot of effort into making sure the engineering was sound so nobody got hurt. if you subtract autopilot, and that's a big if, the car is generally well designed minus the fit and finish issues + interior, but i'd argue that's never been tesla's strong point anyway. the cars are fast, the 2013-2014 model s lines were really good, solid, basic cars. my last straw was the summon feature - i strongly believe a car you are not in, backing out on its own from a parking space with the current sensors is super dangerous.  gt;i was making jokes with the tesla expats when ol' musky launched his roadster into space that you could see the gaps in the fit and finish without a telescope #  gt; gt;i just thought defending tesla on the safety front was a bit strange  gt;i think i just got caught up in their collision safety. i dunno, most of us really tried our best to do things the safe way - i advocated for patching out shellshock and heartbleed across the company really hard but a lot of it fell on deaf ears for too long  gt;also advocated for switching out boards with something that had an hsm, doing hab stuff, encrypting the ssl keys the car has (they're on an unencrypted cf card, lol), mtls for everything on the backend, ipsec between components in the car, etc etc. i just gave up and quit #  gt; gt;what size bed does grimes's ex-boyfriend sleep in on the factory floor  gt;i worked out of deer creek, never really saw him in the factory. rumor is he was stealing an office and sleeping on a couch  gt;edit - **i did see John McCain in deer creek once, that was a trip. showed him some of the stuff we were working on** #  gt;just remembered some bits of trivia  gt;* they took away our free snacks in deer creek and replaced them with lovely vendors  gt;* said vendors food poisoned people often enough osha or whatever the body is shut them down  gt;* people were so mad about the free cereal being gone they'd intra-office snail mail bowls of cereal from the factory and post pictures in slack  gt;* deer creek's parking got so bad (too many people, not enough space) they hired permanent valets  gt;* they were cited for the shitshow parking for fire safety violations (unconfirmed, but i believe it)  gt;* elon publicly being a shitbag to trans people  gt;* the first time we turned on real time telemetry for the dev fleet we caught somebody going 130mph over the san mateo bridge  gt;* it networking so bad the company had permanent 5~8% consistent packet loss between various places (like, next rack)  gt;* firmware git repo so large they had to mirror it (something like 2TB) #  gt; gt;What would describe as being the most seriously hosed up thing you saw happen there? Define hosed up any way you want to.  gt;internal politics. the most toxic culture i have ever encountered, heard about or worked in  gt;i swear they selected for the shittiest people in silicon valley and made them managers #  gt; gt;lmao $100k cars should not have issues with fit and finish that haven't been since the death of british leyland  gt;depending on when and what features you got (and if you got a marketing used car) they could go as low at $40k after incentives - but totally agree with you. fit/finish issues have been a thorn in their side forever  gt;the touchscreen is kind of a safety issue in that you have to look at it to touch it, stealing focus. tactile buttons for some functions would have been better #  gt; gt;Another safety issue at Tesla is that of being swatted by your CEO for pointing out that resin is being injected into the holes of unsafe lithium batteries and shipped into a bunch of customers' cars  gt;some friends of mine worked with the guy, the jury is still out on that one. ol' musky isn't totally paranoid - we did catch bad actors doing stuff and they were nailed to the wall. finding a real apt in your network can be some next level poo poo</TEXT>
