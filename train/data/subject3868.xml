    <TEXT>I know many people are going to think this is the wrong advice. Don't admit it. Stop going to those sites. Your brother has little to no proof right now, so you're not in trouble *yet*. Finish college. Get a job and a place of your own *asap*. After that, out yourself to them and tell them that if they cannot accept you for who you are, they can go f- themselves. By then you will have a stable life, and you won't 'need' them anymore. I know that sounds harsh, but your sexuality is a part of you. If they don't accept that, they don't deserve to be in your life. Don't risk them taking your college opportunities and freedom away by outing yourself right now.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You're disgusting for agreeing to have sex with someone who's married. There's no future in it for you, and you're potentially ruining other peoples' lives. What will his children think if they ever find out? They will never look at their father in the same way. Think before you do retarded things.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I hate the fact that we all became so materialistic. I'm an iPhone user and I'm not gonna deny the fact that I *need* that thing more than anything. That, and my laptop. But imo that's because it's forced upon us. We *need* to check our mail every day, we *need* to mail this assignment, contact this person, verify our class schedules for that week, ... If I was allowed to write my assignments and hand them in, I think I would do that from time to time. If I could *ever* catch a professor on campus, I wouldn't need to go online and mail him/her. Even our tests are performed via laptop now. It's borderline ridiculous. That's not even the worst part. It's completely addicting too. When sitting in a group with friends, almost everyone is occupied with their phones. We might as well group text because the social interaction isn't going anywhere anymore. I've seen people do 'games' in restaurants to get around this, putting the phones on top of eachother on the corner of the table and the first one to grab their phone loses. That's how far we've come. We need to challenge ourselves as to not to grab our technology. I understand that you feel really bad about not fitting in because you cannot afford to have these items, but honestly I think you're better off than the rest of us. In the end, we'll be texting stupid shit and you will be reading your book. Just my honest opinion. TL;DR: These machines make our lives a lot easier, but ultimately ruin our social skills.</TEXT>

Your condition however is a serious one and tough to overcome. I wish you the best in life and try to be as positive as your limits let you be. Things will get better eventually, and that is a promise from a person that has been around depressed people. There *is* room for improvement. There's just a lot of personal work that needs to be done and possibly external help.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was standing outside of class waiting for my prof to show up. Me and my friends were just talking about random stuff, when the subject "the supernatural" suddenly turned up. No idea how we got there, but that's not important. A 28 y/o student (married, a kid, strong character, has her shit together) started telling us about an event that occurred not long after her grandma had died. One day she was just watching TV, sitting on the left side of her couch when she suddenly felt a cold streak. She felt like she was freezing, eventhough it was warm outside. When she moved away from the couch she felt fine. Every time she sat back in that spot, she would feel like she was caught up in a blizzard or something. She was really freaked out by it, and she did believe in the supernatural somewhat by then, so she decided to call someone to take a look at it. I was told that, from the moment this person involved with the supernatural entered the livingroom, she immediately said "The problem is a fairly old woman sitting on the left side of your couch", pointing at the exact spot where my friend had been sitting. My friend said that it was one of the most chilling things that had ever happened to her, because she had never seen this person before, and she had not given her any information whatsoever. I am still skeptical about the supernatural, but the way my friend told her story made me believe that she absolutely thought it was real. I felt weird for a little while.</TEXT>

That's when she suddenly showed up, tail waggin' and looking upto me with a happy face. I picked her up and held her close. She licked my face and I smiled. I instantly felt better, and realized she's always been there for me at my toughest moments. Sometimes simple gestures of love (and soft fur) really do the trick. Just wanted to include a [picture] of my little guardian angel. Thanks for reading.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>First of all, I'm very sorry for your loss. Second, a lot of people around you are going to tell you to be strong, that everything's going to be alright, etc. It's going to be annoying because you 100% believe that it's not going to be ok right now. Don't get angry at them for trying to help you though, be glad you have them to lean on. As for the possible open casket funeral, I'm going to be blunt because I wish someone had been blunt to me at the time. I witnessed an open casket funeral of a close friend and it was very traumatizing to me. Everyone who walked inside with a straight face came out as a wreck. If this is the case, I strongly advise you to look the other way. This is *not* the last image you want of your loved one. The grief will lessen with time, but not anytime soon. Take good care of yourself and talk to the people around you about it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I live in the flemish part of Belgium, and learning French is obligated here because our country is half Dutch, half French. I have been struggling with the language for most of my life. I think I have about 8 years of experience now. Dutch is nothing like French though, which makes it very difficult to master for me. Your mother tongue makes a huge difference in the difficulty of learning this language. It's all about perseverance though. Nothing's impossible, as long as you *really* want it. However, I don't recommend online courses as they've never done the trick for me personally. You're better off taking evening courses or something similar to that if you really want to make progress.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Okay so this is basically the deal. I currently have an iPhone 4 and I'm on prepaid (I'm a poor bastard, I know). I do have certain benefits such as unlimited use of facebook through data usage, etc. However, when I turn my data usage on, everything else obviously updates too and that gets added to my bill. **What I want, is an app that allows me to deny certain apps 3G access while allowing some others to fetch their data.** Now, I have tried looking everywhere. Google search, reddit search, ended up on a bunch of forums, nobody could help me. You're my last hope, Reddit. ps: I don't wish to turn my fetch settings off, I know that would simply solve the problem too but I'm on wifi A LOT where I want my fetch settings to be on. I just need my data usage for the daily traveling I do.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Distance yourself. I've tried (and seen other people try) the whole "let's be friends"-thing and it never works out if you do it right after the relationship ends. You've just been really close to someone, you can't treat them like a friend yet because you still see them from a different perspective. I understand he means a lot to you, but I really think it will be much more beneficial for you both to be friends in a few months rather than straight away. The feelings will not die down if you stay close, I can guarantee that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>When I was 12 years old, I went to the store with my mom. I saw this magazine that had this beautiful hair pin on it, and I really wanted it. I begged my mother for it, but she would not budge. When she wasn't looking, I took the hair pin out of the magazine and quickly stashed it in my pockets. Fast forward to a few days later, my mom was doing the laundry. She found the hair pin and was furious. *She made me go back to the store and apologize to one of the shopkeepers* for stealing the hair pin. I cannot describe how embarrassed and disgusting I felt. From that day on, I never stole again. The point of me telling you this story is that it makes me believe you should really talk to the child's parents about it. She is only going to get worse with time if she doesn't get tapped on the fingers *now*. I know it's a hassle for you that you might not want to deal with, but you'd be correcting the behaviour of which her parents possibly know nothing about.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You're 26 years old, act like it. Your parents may have fucked up but that doesn't mean you have to fuck it up for yourself more. Get your act back together. You are obviously competent, just look at your scores. Take a critical look at yourself. Do your scores prove that you are competent to contribute to this society and make something of your life? Yes. Have you done what I just mentioned? Probably not. So get to it, instead of wasting your time. Don't like the degree/job you have now? Go take evening classes. Educate yourself in subjects you would like to do, learn, struggle, succeed *on your own*. You will feel accomplished. You will end up doing things you love doing. You're just 26. You still have a life ahead of you. Make something out of it instead of sitting here contemplating where it all went wrong.</TEXT>

I remember him holding my hand as he walked me through his immense garden. He was a big fan of gardening, had a huge piece of land with all kinds of vegetables and fruit growing. I remember the sun on my face. I was so happy and dirty when I got back, my mom got mad at me for staining my shirt. It's the only memory I have of my grandfather. He died two years later, I never got to know him properly because I was simply too young. It's okay though. I still have the sheep plushie he gave my parents when I was born. I still have our family pictures, and the several wooden things he crafted with his own hands for our family. My mom and dad said he was a kind man.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There's basically nothing on that list that you can't fix. This is how I see you. Your view of being unattractive is linked to being obese. It damages your self image a lot. You should go over to /r/progresspics and you will see what a change losing weight can do to you. Boring/no personality at all - this is all linked to your own insecurities. You try not to attract too much attention, you're afraid to be in the center of it. There's many options to grow more self-confidence. Again, I think the second paragraph influences this a lot. People open up once they feel good in their skin. Not smart - Being smart is not something you're born with. You process information with timeconsuming hard work. Read books, magazines, etc. Educate yourself. Dead end job - Start applying for other jobs while you're at your current job. Why stay at a job of which you already know it has no further possibilities for you? Have the courage to change. You *can* do all of this. I'm not saying it's going to be easy, but it's possible. It's all in your hands.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm a language student in college and I am currently studying 4 languages: Dutch, English, German and French. The 3 first languages are going great, I can keep up with all the content and I love using them. My French however is still really *really* bad. It's one of my most difficult classes, with 3 books we use in class and 4 self-study books. I'm mostly lacking vocabulary, it just won't stick. What I could really use are some great tips for studying vocab. Links for french TV shows, movies with french subs (I can't find any for the life of me) or some great forums would be amazing. Thanks in advance, I'm becoming really desperate.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I live in Belgium and I have never heard of girls having "casual" abortions, you can't even get it done without it being an exceptional situation as far as I know (e.g. child with a handicap, too young to have children, etc). The doctor can also refuse the procedure if it's for the wrong reasons. I also have the universal healthcare and I can confirm that abortions are covered by it, as it is legal in belgian law. ps: I live in the Dutch part of Belgium (north) and we live very separate from the French part (south), so maybe the situation is completely different there. I'm not sure, those walloons are pretty damn crazy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There are two names I recognize; the Game of Thrones series and the Hitchhiker's 5 book trilogy. The first book I've grabbed from the library is Game of Thrones, and I think that once I finish that series, I will start with the Hitchhiker books. Hopefully I'll be able to up the dose on books per month so I can enjoy them more often. I will also definitely check out the other books you've mentioned as they look very interesting. Thanks a lot for your input, I've written everything down.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This quote hits home with me because I've drastically had to change my life in the past 4 months. It all started with the advice that I should switch from fulltime college to evening classes because one subject was lacking. I ended up changing my entire routine, full evening classes, getting a job, travelling to China in the meantime,.. I could have still been in college right now, struggling and wasting another year knowing that I would still have failed at the subject anyway. Life is a lot better for me now, and all it took was the courage to rebuild my life routine. Thanks OP for making me generate this line of thought. :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This was the first thing that popped up in my mind, however I feel like I'm wasting my employer's time doing this because so many actions need to be noted down to stay precise, it becomes much too timeconsuming. I work in IT repairs and my job consists of 1) helping customers 2) answering the phone 3) repairs and 4) administrative work. The repairs are what becomes most consuming as there are often 10 running at a time. We have a sheet with a checklist but that's not the actual problem; I remember where I left off with each device but I often leave accessories in places they're not supposed to be because I'm in a hurry doing one of the 4 tasks mentioned above. There is also not enough space to keep everything together so I'm thinking about either putting sticky notes on them or labeling them somehow. I have no idea how to handle this so I stop fucking up.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm afraid I don't decide how much I take on at a time - my employer provides me with work for the day. Do you think it would be wise to discuss this with him or better not since it implies I cannot cope well with his workload? Thank you for the good advice regarding the USB stick, I will definitely discuss the option with my employer before I take action on that. Right now the method we use is a simple sheet with a checklist, very effective but it's lacking the obvious things, such as putting the adapter back in the box after the repair is finished, etc. It's the obvious things I always forget about in the rush of the moment.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I wish it were that easy but the other employee and the employer seem to have no issue keeping everything sorted so they'd have to 'invest' in a complete new system just for me. I don't see myself working up the courage to do that just yet. Post it notes = no. How about tape? I found some tape which I can write on. When my shift starts my employer runs me through the tasks at hand because there are often repairs on the table already which I do not know anything about. The first 3 he explains stay crystal clear in my mind but by the time he reaches #10, #1's detailed problems tend to get a little vague. Hence why I thought it was important to make notes for the start of the shift. Is there an approach which you think would be better?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I feel like the iPhone 4 can barely handle iOS 7 as it is; will the jailbreak be even more demanding on my device? Will the use of e.g. Winterboard lag me to hell? Any iPhone 4 jailbreak users out there who can let me know what it's like? Also, last time I tried to jb I got stuck on the Apple Boot Logo, shit wouldn't go into DFU mode either, that sucked. I checked the evasi0n website and saw the quote below which will hopefully fix that problem if I do decide to jailbreak.  gt; Warning! Over The Air updates of iOS 7 are known to create an issue and make the jailbreak fail. Some devices are then stuck on the Apple Boot Logo. Until we fix that, please restore your device to 7.0.4. with iTunes first. Thanks in advance!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My favorite is The Road Not Taken by Robert Frost, especially the last 3 lines hit me hard. Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, And sorry I could not travel both And be one traveler, long I stood And looked down one as far as I could To where it bent in the undergrowth; Then took the other, as just as fair, And having perhaps the better claim, Because it was grassy and wanted wear; Though as for that the passing there Had worn them really about the same, And both that morning equally lay In leaves no step had trodden black. Oh, I kept the first for another day! Yet knowing how way leads on to way, I doubted if I should ever come back. I shall be telling this with a sigh Somewhere ages and ages hence: Two roads diverged in a wood, and I #8212; I took the one less traveled by, And that has made all the difference.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I know I'm a girl and this is an /r/askmen thread, but I hope you will all be okay with me replying. I've noticed how most of these responses have been about women not trying hard enough, being spoiled and expecting the world on a silver plate. I understand and honestly agree, I've seen so many women who are like that. However, please don't give up on dating because of them. I'm 20, average looking and I don't really party often (read: it's been like a year, it's just way too chaotic for me to feel comfortable). More importantly, I'm shy. Almost all of my friends are exactly the way I am. There's a whole different group of women out there who would like (love actually) to be approached by a good guy and give the relationship a fighting chance together. We don't get approached often though. my friends have always said it's because we're 'too plain'. I honestly don't know, but what depresses the hell out of me is that the right guy might be sitting in front of his screen right now thinking 'I give up' because of some bimbo who didn't appreciate him.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Owners of a Beagle, what is the breed really like?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2015-04-12 13:46:30</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm considering getting a new addition to the family. I have experience with dogs but I have never owned a beagle before. I've done various searches for more information on character, but I've found a lot of contradicting information. This is why I've decided to ask owners of these dogs instead. Thanks in advance! **edit: thank you so much for the various responses, I feel like I've really learned a lot about the breed. Sadly this thread has convinced me not to get a Beagle, even though they look like a ridiculously fun breed. My reasons for this decision are:** **1) I live very close to neighbours with small children, the frequent song of his/her people would disturb many others.** **2) Beagles seem to be known for digging their way out of a fenced garden - I have a highway near me and I really don't want to risk something horrible happening.**</TEXT>

    <TEXT>When I opened reddit this morning, I saw a post about a sad owner who just lost his dog. My stomach turned and I instantly turned back to my own grief, having lost my 12 year companion just a month ago. OP, I find these posts just as difficult as you do, because I feel what these owners are going through. I also can't deny that I felt a tinge of 'I wish these posts weren't on here'. But the top posters on here have a very solid point, death is a part of life and thus we shouldn't try to look away from it. Also, I think it can be very relieving for an owner to talk about his/her dog, how it was in life and how it eventually passed away. The support does help, and for that alone I think the posts should remain.</TEXT>

I think when I started thinking about budgeting my money to save up for several expensive purchases (e.g. New car cause my baby is slowly dying, have been on the side of the road seven times last winter) the software felt better for achieving multiple goals and just had more functionality in general. I'm sure the same effect can be achieved in Excel though, it would just require a bit more customization.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's exactly why you should get up and do something. I've noticed that when I have these shitty days, I feel better when I manage to do something productive. It doesn't matter how small that something is, like cleaning, getting a random gift for someone you love, brushing up on certain subjects that interest you, etc. It's fine to let a bad day pass and feel better tomorrow, but it's better to actually change the way you feel in the first place.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>She was crying because her boyfriend's sister keeps harassing her (steals stuff from her home, calls her all day to instigate arguments, shows up at her house unannounced to bicker, etc). Her boyfriend also told her to "fix her own shit" instead of telling his sister to fuck off. I was pretty baffled.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Our music installation at work broke today and I spent the next 20 minutes trying to fix the fucker. Eventually I called "Mood Service" for assistance and this really nice technician picked up. He walked me through so many different steps and regretfully we still couldn't fix it. We made an appointment for further assistance and that was the end of it. I struggle with it for another 20 minutes because I'm stubborn and miraculously get it to work. So I call him back and explain that I was able to fix it, to which he replies that he googled the model of the radio and said "it could now be seen in several radio museums". Yes, that happened. Yes I laughed like a hyena in his ear for the next 60 seconds. He probably thought I was a freak. If you ever read this radio man, I'm sorry. I'm not weird, I swear!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi stranger. I know what depression is, especially at that age. I'm older now, but I would like to give you some insight on what you can do to improve your situation. First of all, you are not alone. Many Belgian teenagers suffer from a depression. The internet is full of scientific research on the topic because the disease is so common with us. There can be so many reasons for depression. We, as a people, have so much stress packed upon our shoulders. We are generally a negative society. The weather doesn't help us either, believe it or not. I can't know what the cause of your depression is and I can't tell you the solution, but I can tell you some things that helped me greatly to feel good about life. - Occupy yourself: I felt like my biggest enemy was my own mind. Sitting at home doing nothing is the worst thing you can possibly do when you feel bad in my opinion, it only makes things far worse. So get a weekend job. Find a hobby. Do a weekly outing with friends. Or all of those combined. The days where you're lying on your bed thinking about how fucked up everything is need to diminish greatly. - Spend time with friends: I stopped doing this when I was in a bad state because I just felt too shitty to go out. Eventually most people stopped asking me because I always said no. The key is to say yes, even if you don't want to go. Force yourself to go essentially. Afterwards you will come home and think 'you know what, I actually ended up enjoying myself'. - Get good at something: this one is great, and I have always loved to improve myself since. There are so many things you can learn if you set your mind to it. You can do it online or in real life. Irl you can learn an instrument, or draw or paint. All of these skills are beautiful, and will make you appreciate yourself a lot more. A loser can't draw a beautiful picture, right? Online you can learn about other languages, coding, geography, biology, math, psychology. If you're interested in any links I can provide them for you. All of these things basically mean: work on yourself. Get busy, get social, get motivated. I know you're still stuck in the same rut of high school but college will be a change like no other. You will find new friends and enjoy the subjects that you are following in college, unlike highschool where you have to take everything in. I used to have this [non zero day system](https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1q96b5/i_just_dont_care_about_myself/cdah4af) that I found on reddit, and every time I feel useless it has succeeded in making me feel better. Hope any of this can be of use to you, friend. Tl;dr: get off your bed, work on yourself, get busy, get social, get motivated.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; The general rules are to make sure they're not sheer and wear them with something that covers your crotch and butt (or at least like 80% of it). I personally wear leggings with a tunic or long top and flats in spring/summer, or with boots and a big cozy sweater in fall/winter. This is exactly what I was looking for, thank you. I'm going shopping this weekend for cute black boots and an oversized warm sweater or two. It's really cold here right now. I don't own shorter tops so I haven't really considered it. Thank you for your advice!</TEXT>

I'm not sure if they're revealing on me ([here's](https://imgur.com/a/Ja2Ze) what they look like, pretty bad lighting sorry!). I'll keep your advice in the back of my mind when I buy some drapey sweaters this weekend! Any advice on what color I should go for to fit with those leggings or anything is good for those colors?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Back when I was in high school, I still rode my bike to school every morning. I was about to enter the reserved space for bikes when I heard a senior say "that girl is so ugly". I passed him with my bike a moment later, looked at him and he responded with a disgusted noise and the words: "you really are ugly". I was young and very shy, while he was already hitting 18 and twice my height. He was also known to be aggressive. I know what they say about sticks and stones but to me that's bullocks, you can really hurt someone with just words. This was 7 years ago and I still remember it vividly.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I took a test and turns out I'm mostly visual learner as well. I did score 50% visual and 40% auditory, which kind of makes sense because I feel the need talk out loud while I study and I make schematics. However, lately I've found this way of summarizing to be very time consuming and I'm looking into another way to study. Your method seems very structured, but I just don't know if I could pull it off. I'm not very good at seperating important content from details. It all seems important to me. Thank you for your input. :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi everyone! I have a 5 month old puppy who shows some peculiar behavior. In the evenings I often go to my room and I take Sam with me. He will often be on the bed with me. When he gets sleepy he will walk quickly in circles, growl at the sheets, scratch the sheets, proceed to lie down and sleep in under a minute. Is this behavior the equivalent of 'plumping the pillows' or should I be worried about this behavior being territorial? His tail is wagging as he does it and his growling is not aimed at me. He's focused on the sheets. Is him being on the bed a problem? Thanks!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I really don't like this reply. OP states he/she doesn't want to drink, you reply with 'just one or two drinks OP'. There's plenty of reasons to be cautious as well, many people have a seriously debilitating alcohol addiction. There's no obligation to drink at all. There are plenty of people who don't drink and still have fun, OP.</TEXT>
