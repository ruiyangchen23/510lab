    <TEXT>When looking at the party footage they see that Alex is holding the same labeled beer at the start and end of the party, implying it was the same beer. Isn't it possible that he could have just had 11 of the same type of beer? Not a major plot hole I know but I was just wondering.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2018-07-06 12:22:34</DATE>
    <TEXT>Recently I have come across hundreds if not thousands of disgusting, uncensored images and videos of underaged children who are either naked or involved in sexual acts. I have reported as many accounts and posts as possible but the only way it can be stopped entirely is if the team at Twitter dedicate resources and people to bring a halt to this. You hear about child p\*rn on the dark web and feel sick to the bottom of your stomach, so the fact that it is able to exist just a quick twitter search away is beyond disturbing. There are whole rings of accounts who are sharing these images and videos on groupchats as well as to twitter itself. Twitter needs to take ***quick and effective action*** into shutting down these accounts before it spreads further. #EndTwitterCP</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I complained about many things about Nicki not just her rapping about pussy. I don #8217;t decide wether I like a rapper or not depending on if they rap about pussy or not. I decide depending on how relatable they are, storytelling, actual meaning behind the lyrics, their personality and not constantly brining in sexual things just for the sake of it</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Depends where you go but for the most part yes it is hot and very humid. Where about are you staying? For necessities I would say bring tissues with you everywhere because barely any public toilets have toilet roll. A spare t-shirt will also come in handy in your backpack when out and about because of all the sweating. Furthermore, a can of deodorant or body spray as well as a towel are also good for wiping away sweat and making sure you don #8217;t smell too bad. Bring basic medication such as painkillers and plasters. I found myself using blister plasters and insect bite cream an awful lot so make sure you have enough of those. Nothing else really apart from that. Just be careful about what you are eating. Even  #8216;western food #8217; out there can be bad for you. I had a McDonald #8217;s one night and could barely move for the whole next day due to stomach pains. Also avoid drinking tap water if you can because the chemicals they use are very different to what we are used to in the west and can make you quite ill. Just stick to bottled water and you will be fine.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Went to Beijing for the first week and then Shenyang for the second week. Before the trip I knew no Chinese what so ever and after the trip I know pretty much no Chinese what so ever. We went to a karaoke bar one night which was by far the most fun I #8217;ve had in a long time. I know it may sound na #239;ve but it has made me appreciate the things we have in the West. The ability to just put a glass under the tap an drink straight from there, among other things, is something that I personally don #8217;t take for granted enough</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Also download the Google Translate app and download the Chinese Simplified language as well as English. This enables you to type things in and be able to communicate with the locals without having to be connected to internet. You can also use the camera which means you can translate things by hovering over them. The translation isn #8217;t great but it usually gives you a few key words which enables you to take an educated guess at what something is or what it says</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Holy shit that #8217;s a lot lol. I #8217;d like to think in the U.K. it #8217;s a lot more simple From age 5-11 you are in primary school. The first year is called Reception. The second year is Year 1, third year is Year 2 etc until Year 6 which is the top year in primary school. After primary school you go to secondary school from age 11-16. The first year is Year 7 (carries on from primary school years) up until Year 11 where you take GCSE exams. These are used to decide wether you are smart enough to enter the next stage of education or if you want to apply for an internship. After Year 11 you join 6th Form (if you stay at the same school or you can enter college which is the same thing but it #8217;s an entirely independent institution that only provides for Years 12 (known as Lower 6th) and Years 13 (known as upper 6th) which is up until age 18. These are the two years that you study and take A Level exams. These are used to decide what university you can go to and also if you are qualified enough for a job. Some people don #8217;t take A Levels and can instead join an internship or take something called Btecs which are very specific subjects but it is nearly impossible to get into good university #8217;s if you take Btecs because they are seen as quite worthless. Btecs are made fun of quite a lot by people because they are a lot of the time worthless. For example you can do a Btec in hairdressing. And then university is considered  #8216;Higher Education #8217; and is a whole other kettle of fish which I #8217;m not aware of how it works. Now I look back at it that #8217;s not very simple at all lmao. And that #8217;s not even everything. Anyways hope I could help man</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have started a new sub-reddit dedicated to everything Dreamville at r/dreamvillerecords and would appreciate it if you would go and check it out. I was dissapointed that the current Dreamville sub-reddit is very unactive so I decided to start this up. I am planning to be very active on it as there are no other places for Dreamville discussion. Please everyone check it out. Thank You! r/dreamvillerecords</TEXT>
