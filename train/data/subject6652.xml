    <TITLE>Angered/Enraged by criticism, comments and jokes on me</TITLE>
    <DATE>2013-08-16 01:15:23</DATE>
    <TEXT>I get often very enraged by comments, like criticizing my work, or saying something negative about my outfit, or some joking about me. Some examples so you know what I am talking about: * A Co-Worker said jokingly:  #8220;Why you working on this side, you think you are something better than us? #8221; laughing as if he didn #8217;t me it. (But I know he did mean it, because I always have the best performance at work and I am the fastest and not much of a talker ) * A relative of mine about my outfit:  #8220;Well you shirt doesn #8217;t match your jeans, it #8217;s doesn #8217;t suit your outfit #8221; - F U * A Co-Worker telling me I can #8217;t do the job because it it #8217;s physically demanding, indicating that I am physically weak/unfit. In a rude manner. As you read this comments you may think they are harmless, so do I now just reading them. But as I got this comments and the days and weeks afterwards, and as I relive them in my mind. It angers me hugely. I want to crush this people. I want to break any contact with those people; I want to treat them as badly as they treated me. These incidents haunt me and I never can forgive this people, I feel treated like shit and very unfair. They are the reason I don #8217;t want to have any social contact and I am so isolated. I cant handle the shit I get from people. Is this a bipolar symptom?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>From time to time we have posts here saying how people got miraculously better and have a fulfilling live, with a partner, family, good job, good education and what not. These people arent bipolar in the first place, the bipolar spectrum has been overblown and suddenly everyone is going around and claiming to be bipolar, a severe serious long life disorder. The fact is bipolar is a progressing illness and always gets worse. The emotional control and inhibition gets poorer and poorer with time, bipolar folks loose grey matter at a rapid rate, the stress toleration goes down and down. Bipolar disorder impairs your cognitives performace significantly, again it gets worse and worse as the illness goes on. So the moment where you are now, is your peak, it wont get better. I have no good news for you. I know you would like to hear hopeful messages and I painfully want to have some good news for you, but I would be lying. Medication can somewhat slower the degression and on-going irreparable deterioration in your brain but it comes at a prices, most mood stabilizers expect lamictal have severe side effects, espc in the long term. I recommend you the following book, it shows extensively how bipolar disorder literally destroy your brains, and that basically everything is wrong with you. The emotional regulation is so messed up and doing the exact opposite of what it should be doing. You are destined for a life of misery. http://www.amazon.com/Cognitive-Dysfunction-Bipolar-Disorder-Clinicians/dp/1585622583/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8 amp;qid=1378495507 amp;sr=8-1 amp;keywords=Cognitive+Dysfunction+in+Bipolar+Disorder</TEXT>

    <TEXT>*I worte that several weeks ago but I guess it was offensive to some folks so I will try to rewrite it, in a less offensive language.* Bipolar is a progressing illness and always gets worse.

Bipolar disorder impairs the cognitives performance/functioning significantly, again it gets worse and worse as the illness goes on.

I get it, you want to hear that everything is going to be okay, who doesn't want, but dont be surprised when you will wake up being 40 y/o and realize that everything has gone to sh*t.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Quit antipsychotics</TITLE>
    <DATE>2013-10-24 22:53:48</DATE>
    <TEXT>I was for 6 months on and off on antipsychotics. They damped my emotions, sometimes so much that I felt empty, but not depressed empty, nothing concerned me, I wasn't worried, I wasn't happy. I existed. Every time I quit, I felled back into rage, hating people, being evil so I started taking them again. Now I am 4 weeks of antipsychotics and somethings the rage slowly evolves from nowhere, you have to be on alert and catch those thoughts as they come up or they will overwhelm you and take a hold of you. My mood is not as stable but overall its worth having feelings and to be more vital. This is no advise to stop taking your mood stabilizers, I''m still on lamictal. But I am glad to be off antipsychotics. They are generally somewhat problematic. add: I was on abilify</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Social anxiety is very isolating. I grew up always being the maverick, not having friends, being always alone. Never felt to belong to any group of people. Not to my class, not to the people in church, not to my race/landsmen, not to my colleagues, not to the folks on reddit. I am not part of this community. It drove me to be hateful. If you dont feel part of something, you cant exactly sympathize. I feel always different to others, I don't see anything that I have in common with them. The only people I can identify with are outsider, weak people. I can't stand most TV-Shows because they portray strong characters, heroes that you are supposed to look up to.

Ever had such thoughts? Every time I even come a mile near thinking about suicide I quickly ditch those thoughts, I have huge savings and before I would kill myself I would burn through them, travel the world, try drugs, get hookers, Idk. I love life but I am very bad at it. TLDR; I've never wanted to kill myself. Too much to enjoy in the world.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The show got excellent reviews from sophisticated TV audience. But never made it to mainstream and was therefore canceled to too low ratings. The show was disliked for its main character Amy (Laura Dearn - got a Golden Globe for that role), she was self-centered, somewhat new age, a illusionist. Most people couldn't identify with her and hated the show. But its really smart show and food for thought. It dealt with some pretty serious and present matters.

    <TITLE>Cant get ahead or through with anything - thanks mood swings</TITLE>
    <DATE>2014-02-28 20:56:34</DATE>
    <TEXT>I have every 1-2 weeks moodswings, they arent extreme but siginficant enought to change my motivation, my thinking, my energy level and perception. When I'm in a hypomania, I'm optimistic and feel there is hope in the future and I can do things. I have the energy and motivation to do things. I often start an activity, make a decision, buy something. I start looking for a job, apply. I enlisted in a university, I want to get ahead with my life. I sign up for gym. Yesterday I read my personal blog-diary. In those times I always wrote something like: "now I have the breakthrough" - "I've grown" - "I've made progress" - "I'm changing for the better" - "I've made alot of realizations". But ultimately after 4-7 days I end up being slightly depressed, no power, no motivation. The world seems harsh and there is no hope for me. I feel unable, faulty and dumb. In those times I give up things, like a book I started reading when I was better. I give up meditation that I wanted to learn. I stop going to gym. I regret the decision to apply for a job and dont reply for the interview appointment. I think I have no chance in studying in electromechanics. I never wont make it, my mind is too slow, I am dumb. This are some examples over the years. So I end up being a unemployed guy, with no girlfriends, no friends, no education expect one in IT, not a muscular body, .... The jobs I had, I got in the good mood swing and when I was in the low again, I regret being in the job and feel overwhelmed with the tasks. I want to leave the job ASAP. This is why I end up being unemployed if I get a job at all. Thats why I dont have a career and didnt get anywhere. My counterparts in highschool have succeeded and all got somewhere. While I stagnated and didn't get anywhere in 6 years. Sometimes I am good and then I contact old friends, when I am bad again I stop contact and wont see them for years or ditch them for good. No friendship can survive that. I had a good time and went out trying to meet a girl. I gave up after 4 or 5 days. And didn't go out for years. I cant blame it all on my bipolar II, I've also issues being hyper sensitive, I basically remember every rejection in the past 8 years. And all hurt up until now. For example I renovated my apartment being good, when I was bad, there was a halt, when I was good again I started buying new furniture. On a bad mood this tasks seems so overwhelming and the decision so huge that I wont do it. I have every resource you can imagine, money, a apartment, affordable education, enough jobs in my country, friends from school/old jobs/neighbors that I reject their attempt to make contact with me. All the books to learn stuff (meditation e.g.). Parents, siblings who support me. I hate reading how others are successful, have a job, a family with bipolar disorder. edit: I'm on medication for half a year. Mood stabilizer Lamictal (Lamotrigin) 250mg. It helped to better the depression phase. TLDR: I cant get things done because my ups and downs mess with me. No GF, no job, no degree. All tried and given up. I start activities and make decision when good and stop when I am bad again. I have everything you need to do something (money, opportunities)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>How did mindfulness change you?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2014-03-03 01:29:49</DATE>
    <TEXT>How did mindfulness influence you, how did you change? And how long have you been doing mindfulness? In the following my experience: I've been doing mindfulness a short while intensively and I'm astonished how much it can influence you. *Politics - To enjoy politics you have to be one side or other and judge and comment. It is everything than awareness, its all about feeding your ego. +Now I look political shows, they dont give me anything. I saw a republican in Arizona going apeshit over gays - it didnt concern me. I wasnt angry at him, it is okay. Its his opinion. It didnt raise any emotions whatsoever. Before engaging in mindfulness I was heavily invested in politics, watching MSNBC everyday, Daily Show, Colbert and I would get upset about republicans saying something insane, republicans winning elections and whatnot. *Sex, Food +They just became tools, I don't get excited over food or sex. Sometimes I feel the need for these urges. I fullfil them but I don't think about it too much. I not hunting for them anymore. *Money +I was greedy and always trying to do deals to make more money than what I earn. I was looking at every way to save money. Now I dont care too much about money, I dont spend much money, because I dont care for stuff too. Before I always thought what to buy next, what I may need. I wanted to have every tool, I bought new electronics. The only thing that I'm still greedy for is "cloths" I like to dress well and so I want always new cloths. :) Stuff that I'm still unaware about and where the ego is still in charge: *stark longing for girlfriend *wanting painfully to be charismatic, popular, a good listener with people *feeling attacked by others, I loose any mindfulness *and hundreds and thousands of minor things Overall life have become more quiet, less needy, more peaceful. There is less craving. I don't care so much about anything.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It significantly reduces anxiety, even if doesn't do it for you. You will be way more at ease with your anxiety. You dont feel so bad for feeling anxious. You can calm down your mind after having gone through a anxious situation. When you come out of a social interaction and you give yourself shit for being so awkward, not having said anything, said the wrong things, you will recognize those thoughts and take them less seriously. I had good results with mindfulness, in just 3 weeks. It goes way beyond anxiety. Its definitely worth a try. But you have to put effort in it, at first being aware and mindful was hard, it took time as I saw the first results and rewards, now I am so happy to have come across mindfulness. I wish I had learned about it 10 years ago when I was in my late teens.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2014-05-29 10:31:10</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm now 4 Months in, in mindfulness practice and I see the enormous transitional power and potential it has. My attitude changed so much, I view my own thoughts very different and can distance myself from my emotions and thoughts. Mindfulness is watching your thoughts and feelings moment by moment without judging or analyzing them. Just watch what is happening. I can recommend it enough for everyone, espc for Bipolar II. It has become very popular and widespread. Vets, Soldiers, Inmates, CEOs, employees and politicians are practicing. I wont tell you, that you'll be happy all the time, thats not what it is about. But your approach to feeling "negative" emotions and hurtful/self-destructive thoughts will be different. I wish I would have learned about this technique 10-15 years ago, I would have developed so much better and it would spare me a lot of pain. Give it a chance, do it for at least 3 months, take 10-15mins every day. Withhold judgment for this 3 months whether it works or not, put aside all expectations. To start I recommend the App "Headspace" it is a guided meditation and leads you day by day. At first it is common that you think, you arent doing it right, that is isnt working for you and so on, that is normal, everyone goes through a phase like that. Go on!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Meditation novices. I'm at the start myself but I have seen how big a change is possible and how it is always within you to reach. If you meet resistance, stagnation or feel meditation/awareness makes things worse, withhold judgment and keep going on. Dont expect any results - review/judge any effects later in your mindfulness journey. The approach to mindfulness/meditation is very important - especially at first - where unknown challenges arise and one isnt yet sure how to deal with them, if one is doing it right or wrong. Trust in the transforming powers of meditation, dont second guess or be too skeptic (it isnt working for me, I cant do this,..) I know you have probably heard those statement so often in the community, meditation resources whatever - but trust me - this is common knowledge for a good reason, it is true. I have been meditating and being mindful throughout the day for the past 5 months. And yesterday I caught myself jokingly thinking it is illegal, it is unfair, to feel that good. - Why are people doing even drugs? :) - But it isnt even about feeling good. Dont work to get there. hope this helps or makes any difference.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Is there no single day you dont think about your problem, shyness and fear? Is your main goal getting rid of it or lessening it? THAT sounds like a lot of stress and a big burden you put on yourself. The fear and shyness them self are stressing but by making it our #1 problem and something we need to *slove* we put the biggest burden of social anxiety on ourself. I have started practicing awareness/mindfulness/meditation 5 months ago and social anxiety isnt a real issue anymore. I havent thought about it in months. Just saw it the /r/socialanxiety reddit in my reddit list and thought I share. Its not that I lost my social anxiety but I lost striving. Striving to change things. To not accept things as they are and to want things to be different than they are NOW. I have reached more in those 5 months than in the previous 10 years I worked on solving my problem (social anxiety). Taking psychopharma, reading acclaimed books, learning everything about anxiety, reading and sharing in forums. I am not here to sell you a social phobia cure, meditation makes our life less stressful and lower anxiety is a by product. It takes a lot effort (meditating daily 20-40min - which is highly concentrated practise) but once it is a habit, you cant go a day without it.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>mind heavily connected to ego/sense of self</TITLE>
    <DATE>2014-07-28 22:19:18</DATE>
    <TEXT>I feel how my mind is clinging to the ego, to the idea of self. Meditation requires to let go or loosen this bond. To see feelings and thoughts as they come and go but not seeing them as "my feelings" - "i am feeling". Not connecting so much to them. This is exactly my problem. It is nearly impossible at times for me to look at the thoughts coming up without commenting on them, analyzing, constantly thinking how to meditate and so on. Even the watching or notching is done by the mind, by thinking.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have recognized this pattern in the past 5 months that I have been meditating. The periods last for 1-2 weeks. In periods with higher awareness, I recognize thoughts and emotions very easily and dont identify with them. My minds seems more calm and relaxed. In periods of low awareness, a lot of painful thoughts come up, I cant let go of the thoughts and emotions. Am I just making this all up, with my perception being deceived or maybe I just want to see this patterns and reforce that happinging by that. sorry for my english btw</TEXT>

    <TITLE>mindfulness recognizing huge mood swings</TITLE>
    <DATE>2014-08-22 20:26:14</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I am doing this meditation course. I am at the part about the mind state, emotions and feelings. I am supposed to watch how feelings are coming and going. It is said that they are always changing. I should watch out when a feeling, mind state evolves and when it leaves. I should remind myself of mind states that I am currently not in/not feeling. Thereby see that feelings are not constant and not so much identify with them, because they come and go. I have been doing this for a week. Espc today I realized huge mood swings within hours and less. I felt deep love and connectedness and later in the day I felt hostile and hate towards others. When I felt love I saw the kindness in people and interpreted actions and looks of people very positive. While I was dwelling in that state I got hugged and kissed by a stranger. This love and kindness I felt must somehow have emitted to the outside. I recognized how when I got in a worse mood (anger, resistance, sadness, pitty) my mind told me nonstop - "now the good streak is over, you are unaware again", "this was just due to the drug you took last week", "thats naturally who you are", "meditation is not going to get you out there", "this will last".... Only to feel love again two hours later again.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Attitude towards meditation</TITLE>
    <DATE>2014-08-27 19:44:30</DATE>
    <TEXT>Having the right attitude towards meditation or mindfulness is so important and often over looked. We should remind ourself what we are doing and why. How we want to approach being aware and with what mindset. We have to make sure keeping our compass at the right direction by reminding us of this principles from time to time. When we get caught up in trying and wanting. Non-judging Mindfulness is cultivated by assuming the stance of an impartial witness to your own experience. To do this requires that you become aware of the constant stream of judging and reacting to inner and outer experiences that we are all normally caught up in, and learn to step back from it. Patience Patience is a form of wisdom. It demonstrates that we understand and accept the fact that sometimes things must unfold in their own time. A child may try to help a butterfly to emerge by breaking open its chrysalis. Usually the butterfly doesn #8217;t benefit from this. Any adult knows that the butterfly can only emerge in its own time, that the process cannot be hurried. In the same way we cultivate patience toward our own minds and bodies when practicing mindfulness. We intentionally remind ourselves that there is no need to be impatient with ourselves because we find the mind judging all the time, or because we are tense or agitated or frightened, or because we have been practicing for some time and nothing positive seems to have happened. We give ourselves room to have these experiences. Why? Because we are having them anyway! When they come up, they are our reality, they are part of our life unfolding in this moment. So we treat ourselves as well as we would treat the butterfly. Why rush through some moments to get to other,  #8220;better #8221; ones? After all, each one is your life in that moment. Non-striving Almost everything we do we do for a purpose, to get something or somewhere. But in meditation this attitude can be a real obstacle. That is because meditation is different from all other human activities. Although it takes a lot of work and energy of a certain kind, ultimately meditation is a non-doing. It has no goal other than for you to be yourself. The irony is that you already are. This sounds paradoxical and a little crazy. Yet this paradox and craziness may be pointing you toward a new way of seeing yourself, one in which you are trying less and being more. This comes from intentionally cultivating the attitude of non-striving. Acceptance Acceptance means seeing things as they actually are in the present. If you have a headache, accept that you have a headache. If you are overweight, why not accept it as a description of your body at this time? Sooner or later we have to come to terms with things as they are and accept them. Often acceptance is only reached after we have gone through very emotion-filled periods of denial and then anger. These stages are a natural progression in the process of coming to terms with what is. They are all part of the healing process.Acceptance does not mean that you have to like everything or that you have to take a passive attitude toward everything and abandon your principles and values. Acceptance as we are speaking of it simply means that you have come around to a willingness to see things as they are. This attitude sets the stage for acting appropriately in your life, no matter what is happening. You are much more likely to know what to do and have the inner conviction to act when you have a clear picture of what is actually happening than when your vision is clouded by your mind #8217;s self-serving judgments and desires or its fears and prejudices. In the meditation practice, we cultivate acceptance by taking each moment as it comes and being with it fully, as it is. We try not to impose our ideas about what we should be feeling or thinking or seeing on our experience but just remind ourselves to be receptive and open to whatever we are feeling, thinking, or seeing, and to accept it because it is here right now. If we keep our attention focused on the present, we can be sure of one thing, namely that whatever we are attending to in this moment will change, giving us the opportunity to practice accepting whatever it is that will emerge in the next moment. Clearly there is wisdom in cultivating acceptance. Letting Go When we start paying attention to our inner experience, we rapidly discover that there are certain thoughts and feelings and situations that the mind seems to want to hold on to. If they are pleasant, we try to prolong these thoughts or feelings or situations, stretch them out, and conjure them up again and again. Similarly there are many thoughts and feelings and experiences that we try to get rid of or to prevent and protect ourselves from having because they are unpleasant and painful and frightening in one way or another. When we observe our own mind grasping and pushing away, we remind ourselves to let go of those impulses on purpose, just to see what will happen if we do. When we find ourselves judging our experience, we let go of those judging thoughts. We recognize them and we just don #8217;t pursue them any further. We let them be, and in doing so we let them go. Similarly when thoughts of the past or of the future come up, we let go of them. We just watch. -JKZ</TEXT>

He see things happening.  gt;Nothing is done by me, everything just happens I do not expect, I do not plan, I just watch events happening, knowing them to be unreal. The three states rotate as usual -- there is waking and sleeping and waking again, but they do not happen to me. They just happen. To me nothing ever happens. There is something changeless, motionless, immovable, rocklike, unassailable; a solid mass of pure being-consciousness-bliss. I am never out of it. Nothing can take me out of it, no torture, no calamity. I try to take the same approach, but who is responsible and how can I take this stand and at the same time not get lazy or binge on pleasures like eating, sex, ..?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Beautiful parable about Realization by Ramana Maharshi</TITLE>
    <DATE>2014-11-18 21:14:50</DATE>
    <TEXT>The attaining of realization, the goal of realization is so hardcoded in us. I thought this parable explained the concept of being realized, being the real self, here and now, very well.  gt;The ten foolish men forded a stream and on reaching the other shore wanted to make sure that all of them had in fact safely crossed the stream. One of the ten began to count, but while counting the others left himself out.  #8216;I see only nine; sure enough, we have lost one. Who can it be? #8217; he said.  #8216;Did you count correctly? #8217; asked another, and did the counting himself. But he too counted only nine. One after the other each of the ten counted only nine, missing himself.  #8216;We are only nine #8217;, they all agreed,  #8216;but who is the missing one? #8217; they asked themselves. Every effort they made to discover the  #8216;missing #8217; individual failed.  #8216;Whoever he is that is drowned #8217;, said the most sentimental of the ten fools,  #8216;we have lost him. #8217; So saying he burst into tears, and the others followed suit. Seeing them weeping on the river bank, a sympathetic wayfarer enquired about the cause. They related what had happened and said that even after counting themselves several times they could find no more than nine. On hearing the story, but seeing all the ten before him, the wayfarer guessed what had happened. In order to make them know for themselves they were really ten, that all of them had survived the crossing, he told them,  #8216;Let each of you count for himself but one after the other serially, one, two, three and so on, while I shall give you each a blow so that all of you may be sure of having been included in the count, and included only once. The tenth missing man will then be found. #8217; Hearing this they rejoiced at the prospect of finding their  #8216;lost #8217; comrade and accepted the method suggested by the wayfarer. While the kind wayfarer gave a blow to each of the ten in turn, he that got the blow counted himself aloud.  #8216;Ten, #8217; said the last man as he got the last blow in his turn. Bewildered they looked at one another,  #8216;We are ten, #8217; they said with one voice and thanked the wayfarer for having removed their grief. That is the parable. From where was the tenth man brought in? Was he ever lost? By knowing that he had been there all the while, did they learn anything new? The cause of their grief was not the real loss of anyone, it was their own ignorance, or rather, their mere supposition that one of them was lost. Such is the case with you. Truly there is no cause for you to be miserable and unhappy. You yourself impose limitations on your true nature of infinite being, and then weep that you are but a finite creature. Then you take up this or that spiritual practice to transcend the non-existent limitations. But if your spiritual practice itself assumes the existence of the limitations, how can it help you to transcend them? Hence I say know that you are really the infinite pure being, the Self. You are always that Self and nothing but that Self. Therefore, you can never be really ignorant of the Self. Your ignorance is merely an imaginary ignorance, like the ignorance of the ten fools about the lost tenth man. It is this ignorance that caused them grief.</TEXT>

Most shows that came out and where successful with viewers as with critics put a lot of money into it and their premise was something bold to put on tv. Anti-Heroes, Tabus, They put hundreds of cops shows out, where cops are heroes, working for the greater good - why dont they do a show where they show how despicable, corrupt, violent, racist and lazy cops are? Where the criminals are the heroes? I know this isnt everyones soup, rednecks and high-school dropouts wouldnt tune in.

When I look, I dont see, things dont have no meaning. This is not the direction I want to go into, I rather want to be able to listen to others, be interested in others, feel them.

    <TEXT>I generally agree that PMO is a addiction, builds bad habits and can lower your general well-being. BUT I see here stories of incredible changes after quitting like one guy said he started a business, started playing piano, got a girlfriend, ... - that well may be, but lets not get cause and effect wrong. Its not due the stopping of fapping that all this changed/happed. I see on r/meditation people making similar claims after starting to meditate, on r/fitness after starting to work out, people sudderending to their religion. This concept that PMO ruins your life and nothing gets done is not true. While I admire the willpower, the positive change that comes with taking matters on your own hand, I say: easy there pal - you didnt find the magic pill. I've quit PMO for quite a while. Nearly two months without any masturbation. For the last half year with masturbation but no porn. My life didnt change suddenly completely. Yes there are changes, maybe they are to attribute to stopping PMO, maybe not, I cant tell. This religious attitude folks display here, create wrong expectations and leads to disappointments and further to relapse .</TEXT>

Sri nisargadatta maharaj replied to the question of a follower. if one ought to meditate first, in order to build concentration before doing self-enquiry:  gt;To me, all delay is a waste of time. You can skip all the preparation and go directly for the ultimate search within. Of all the Yogas it is the simplest and the shortest.

    <TITLE>The big error of meditation as described by Sam Harris</TITLE>
    <DATE>2015-05-04 20:23:25</DATE>
    <TEXT>excuse the title  gt;Everyone has had the experience of looking through a window and suddenly catching sight of his own reflection staring back at him from the glass. At that point, he can use the glass as a window, to see the world outside, or as a mirror, but he can #8217;t do both at the same time.  gt;Sometimes your reflection in the glass is pretty subtle, and you could easily stand there for ten minutes, looking outside while staring right through the image of your own face without seeing it.  gt;For the purposes of this analogy, imagine that the goal of meditation is to see your own reflection clearly in each moment. Most spiritual traditions don #8217;t realize that this can be done directly, and they articulate their paths of practice in ways that suggest that if you only paid more attention to everything beyond the glass #8212;trees, sky, traffic #8212;eventually your face would come into view. Looking out the window is arguably better than closing your eyes or leaving the room entirely #8212;at least you are facing in the right direction #8212;but the practice is based on a fundamental misunderstanding. You don #8217;t realize that you are looking through the very thing you are trying to find in every moment. Given better information, you could just walk up to the window and see your face in the first instant.  gt;The same is true for the illusoriness of the self. Consciousness is already free of the feeling that we call  #8220;I. #8221; However, a person must change his plane of focus to realize this. Some practices can facilitate this shift in awareness, but there is no truly gradual path that leads there. Many longtime meditators seem completely unaware that these two planes of focus exist, and they spend their lives looking out the window, as it were. I used to be one of them. I #8217;d stay on retreat for a few weeks or months at a time, being mindful of the breath and other sense objects, thinking that if I just got closer to the raw data of experience, a breakthrough would occur. Occasionally, a breakthrough did occur: In a moment of seeing, for instance, there would be pure seeing, and consciousness would appear momentarily free of any feeling to which the notion of a  #8220;self #8221; could be attached. But then the experience would fade, and I couldn #8217;t get back there at will. There was nothing to do but return to meditating dualistically on contents of consciousness, with self-transcendence as a distant goal.  gt;However, from the non-dual side, ordinary consciousness #8212;the very awareness that you and I are experiencing in this conversation #8212;is already free of self. And this can be pointed out directly, and recognized again and again, as one #8217;s only form of practice. So gradual approaches are, almost by definition, misleading. And yet this is where everyone starts. http://www.samharris.org/blog/item/taming-the-mind This is what the great prophets like Ramana Maharshi (Self-enquiry), Nisargadatta Maharaj (I am), Nirmala .. Mooji point at. They call it the direct method. Maharaj called meditation at one point even "delay". Maharshi said that breath control just calms the mind, when it is finished the mind will go back to it activities. He saw it at a concentration practice and calming of the mind.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Episodes are in the wanted list but if they arent grabed initially (on release), Sonarr doesnt seem to look for them automatically anymore. Let me make this clear by example. "TVShow#1" S03e08 is released. However there is not a 720p release that is wanted in the Profile of "TVShow#1". Sometimes it takes 1-3 days to be released. However Sonarr doesnt seem to check anymore. It stays in the selected list and nothing happens. Another issue. I have "The political comedy show" being monitored. It doesnt load the release I want because it says the release is bigger than the maxium wanted size ("0 Byte") in Profile. Nowhere did I set a maxium size of 0 Byte for ANY Profile. Another issue. I am adding a new Show. I only want the latest season. How can I tell this to sonar? edit: replaced show names by placeholders</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Don't let your mind overtake your meditation</TITLE>
    <DATE>2015-05-07 19:46:46</DATE>
    <TEXT>In my sitting right know I saw myself "meditating", that is steering the attention from one place to another. Trying to become more aware of the object in my meditation. There was a craving to be really concentrated and to get to the right place. I realized that my mind has taken over and is now trying hard to get somewhere. Usually I would sit and try to "make it right". But this time I realized that it will end in frustration. So I ended it. As meditation my get repitive or the courisness weakens, the mind tends to take over. We are wired to automate any tasks that we do repetitively. Doing it on autopilot. Awareness is ever fresh, untouched and new. The mind however is conditioned by nature. So when the conditioned mind "is meditating" - its not meditation but a distraction. Hope this makes sense.</TEXT>

Self-consciousness is like that. It is the act of constantly referring back to the idea  #8220;me. #8221; Am  #8220;I #8221; still here? How am  #8220;I #8221; doing? How is it going for  #8220;me #8221;? It #8217;s that checking, evaluating, and reflecting on the self that occurs throughout our day. The reason self-consciousness causes suffering is that it refers back to something that doesn #8217;t exist. It #8217;s checking for how  #8220;I #8221; am doing</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Depending on the stress level (physical and psychological) of the day before meditation I am up to 5 minutes gone. Usually though I would guess 30-60s. I recognized when I am very concentrated on my object of meditation I loose myself for longer. I do guided meditation so I know how much I missed and how much time went by. I think there is nothing wrong with forgetting yourself. I recently saw a documentary where scientists doing concentration challenginge tasks in MRT discovered by chance that the highest activity is not while subjects where concentrating but in the pauses between the tasks. They explained that in those moments when subjects lost themself the brain is busy with itself and doing synchronizing tasks over several brain networks.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>The fundamental attitude of non-attainment for meditation</TITLE>
    <DATE>2015-06-18 18:37:22</DATE>
    <TEXT>There's a lovely saying of Tranxu, a great Chinese sage, that I took the trouble to learn by heart. It goes: "When the archer shoots for no particular prize, he has all his skills; when he shoots to win a brass buckle, he is already nervous; when he shoots for a gold prize, he goes blind, sees two targets, and is out of his mind. His skill has not changed, but the prize divides him. He cares! He thinks more of winning than of shooting, and the need to win drains him of power." Isn't that an image of what most people are? When you're living for nothing, you've got all your skills, you've got all your energy, you're relaxed, you don't care, it doesn't matter whether you win or lose. The holy Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj puts it very pointed:  gt;Invariably the object of desire destroys the means of acquiring it and then itself withers away.  gt;Desire is merely the fixation of the mind on an idea. So if you meditate with the idea of having a clear, clam mind, your very object of desire (state of mind), is destroyed by the desire. Failure is bound to happen.</TEXT>

Now I am wondering whether I am doing it right, or I just get used to it so much that it isnt anything special anymore. I have to say that the calmness and centeredness is now very much in my everday life. In the past two years my life was centered around meditation and spirituality. My sense of self changed very much, my desires, my feelings and the way I relate to them. While I gained calmness and centeredness I got detached, even from people that have been closer to me.</TEXT>

You are constantly trying to keep it all together, the system is highly instable, non stop you have to fix things, make things right. This takes up all energy, all power and leaves you powerless and blinded. This is sickness. Though it is seen as the most normal and healthy thing.

    <TEXT>This desire/longing is the only desire that is not of the mind, the only desire that is not for an object. When you are more mature in your journey you will sense it, without any wrong ideas attached to it. You will know that you can not fulfill this yearning with this or that. (Objects as money, job, education, gf, etc). Before spiritual journey we try to fullfil it with all kinds of things only to see that they don't yield, so we move on to the next thing. But you come to know it is not in this or that. This desire is not of the person/mind but from the unmanifasted. Follow it and you will be lead to the unmanifasted, it is your inner guru. It is the strongest and most persistance desires of all. Harness it and think of it often, it will burn other desires until there is only one. Now I just sit with it, this is the only desire which is comfortable to sit with, because it doesnt desire for something that is not here now, as any other desire but for your innermost being. It desires the now. The next time you feel a restlessness and want to start this or that activity (meditation included), take a break and see what you are really desiring, is it really to watch a tv show, to meditate, to draw? Or are you just merely trying to superimpose the desire for yourself.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I am touched by the news from France. So much violence and unnecessary actions. There is no help for the world. How can I abide in my heart while seeing all this suffering. I turned to my teacher to understand how he can be ever untouched and unaffected by the horrors of the world.  gt;I am reading newspapers, I know what is going on! But my reaction is not like yours. You are looking for a cure, while I am concerned with prevention. As long as there are causes, there must also be results. As long as people are bent on dividing and separating, as long as they are selfish and aggressive, such things will happen. If you want peace and harmony in the world, you must have peace and harmony in your hearts and minds. Such change cannot be imposed; it must come from within. Those who abhor war must get war out of their system. Without peaceful people how can you have peace in the world? As long as people are as they are, the world must be as it is. I am doing my part in trying to help people to know themselves as the only cause of their own misery. In that sense I am a useful man. But what I am in myself, what is my normal state cannot be expressed in terms of social consciousness and usefulness. I may talk about it, use metaphors or parables, but I am acutely aware that it is just not so. Not that it cannot be experienced. It is experiencing itself! But it cannot be described in the terms of a mind that must separate and oppose in order to know. The world is like a sheet of paper on which something is typed. The reading and the meaning will vary with the reader, but the paper is the common factor, always present, rarely perceived. When the ribbon is removed, typing leaves no trace on the paper. So is my mind -- the impressions keep on coming, but no trace is left.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Most of you have always meditated on an object. Be it the breath or other bodily sensation. Now my invitation is to try something new, something out of the ordinary, something that doesnt make sense, something that doesnt go with our way of thinking. We think and know in objects. Even our selves we see as an object. As something we can refer to, but if we look closer or question we see that actually we dont even know what we are refering to. "I" - what are we referring to here? Non-Dual meditation focuses on yourself. If opens a whole new world. We know so many things, even in looking inwards we know the breath, the emotions and thoughts. For once lets not know something but be. What is it that I refer as "I"? Obviously we are not looking for an object. We are not an limited object. Now this is only one approach, there are various approaches to non-duality. All are to present you, that there is no duality.

    <TITLE>At the root of the evil is desire</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-10-10 21:56:39</DATE>
    <TEXT>Desire is the most powerful working in us. Desire is for the pleasurable and is born out of the memory of pleasure. Its counterpart is fear. Fear for the painful born out of memory of pain.Both make the mind restless. Desire lt;- gt;Pleasure Fear lt;- gt;Pain We are goaded by those two. Both are interconnected, one can not be had without the other. Pleasure always ends in pain. Because we are in pain we seek for the pleasurable. Break free from one, and you are free from both. We suffer our own desires. What we call progress is merely the change from the painful to the pleasurable. It is said that the highest state, is the state free from desire, bliss, pure bliss, unbounded bliss. Rather than desiring to be desireless, give attention to desire, listen carefully when desire is working in you.</TEXT>

Depending on the drug in matter of hours of days you are back at baseline counissness. This average state of being. Tripping I saw how foolish it was for me to crave certain unhealthy foods and sex, it saw how unnecessary it is, it didnt have any attraction to me anymore. However three days later I am a slave to craving and going after them. Having this insights and understanding doesn't mean having cultivated them. Habit is a bitch and it's powers unbroken.</TEXT>

They are not your concern. You neither do nor enjoy. You are free. You are the Solitary Witness of All That Is, forever free. Your only bondage is not seeing This. The thought:  #8220;I am the doer #8221; is the bite of a poisonous snake. To know:  #8220;I do nothing #8221; is the wisdom of faith. Be happy. A single understanding:  #8220;I am the One Awareness, #8221; consumes all suffering in the fire of an instant. Be happy. You are unbounded Awareness #8212; Bliss, Supreme Bliss-- in which the universe appears like the mirage of a snake in a rope. Be happy. It is true what they say:  #8220;You are what you think. #8221; If you think you are bound you are bound. If you think you are free you are free. You are Self #8212;the Solitary Witness. You are perfect, all-pervading, One. You are free, desireless, forever still. The universe is but a seeming in You. Meditate on this:  #8220;I am Awareness alone--Unity itself. #8221; Give up the idea that you are separate, a person, that there is within and without. You have long been bound thinking:  #8220;I am a person. #8221; Let the knowledge:  #8220;I am Awareness alone #8221; be the sword that frees you. You are now and forever free, luminous, transparent, still. The practice of meditation keeps one in bondage. You are pure Consciousness #8212; the substance of the universe. The universe exists within you. Don #8217;t be small-minded. You are unconditioned, changeless, formless. You are solid, unfathomable, cool. Desire nothing. You are Consciousness. The body exists only in imagination, as do heaven and hell, bondage, freedom, fear. Are these my concern? I, who am pure Awareness?  gt;-Gita</TEXT>

Anyone tried that, what do you think? I have very little experience with tripping but I saw the spiritual potential of tripping. Just an example what a spiritual text could look like:  gt;To be free, shun the experiences of the senses like poison. Turn your attention to forgiveness, sincerity, kindness, simplicity, truth. 1.3 You are not earth, water, fire or air. Nor are you empty space. Liberation is to know yourself as Awareness alone #8212; the Witness of these. 1.4 Abide in Awareness with no illusion of person. You will be instantly free and at peace 1.5 You have no caste or duties. You are invisible, unattached, formless. You are the Witness of all things. Be happy. 1.6 Right and wrong, pleasure and pain, exist in mind only. They are not your concern. You neither do nor enjoy. You are free.</TEXT>

There are also phases of real peace where I can experience the fruits of my spiritual path. But if I keep to dig deeper again pain and difficulty come.

The answer to that is people are invested in bitcoins, not only mentally but financially. It is not a bitcoin phenomena but a cryptocurrency phenomena. I am also at the monero subreddit. People there are aswell deluded about Monero, the are die-hard sure it will blow out and is so much better than any other currency. Ask the people about the euro, they dont relate the same way to it as people to bitcoin. I like my euros, no doubt but there is no special relation.

    <TEXT>He wont do any satsang, guidance whatsoever for at least till spring 2017. You may or may not have noticed Mooji being off in the last satsang that was broadcasted. He showed ego, judgment and a clinging to ideas. After that satsang I was very disappointed in Mooji, he handled himself in a distasteful manner, however it showed me that he is only human. He himself said that even the master has to stay vigilant. He wouldnt be the first master to fall back into ego, another realized student of Papaji felt into this trap, having to give up his whole ashram and revert from teaching to become himself a student again. The official site is saying he will take a break into deep meditation. I have strong trust in Mooji and know he will do the right thing, to stop teaching is a good step, he is wise and does not intent to abuse the trust many have given him. I hope the best for him and he is still a very highly regarded and all that he has done cant be renounced. I love him, he has been a great master giving hundreds of hours of advice and always conducted himself in a rightful manner. May he be free of any trace of person, may he come back to full powers, may god be with him.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>An existential crisis is a moment at which an individual questions the very foundations of their life: whether this life has any meaning, purpose, or value. An existential crisis may result from:  gt; Major depressive disorder Major sleep deprivation Prolonged isolation Dissatisfaction with one's life Major psychological trauma The sense of being alone and isolated in the world; A new-found grasp or appreciation of one's mortality, perhaps following diagnosis of a major health concern such as a terminal illness; Believing that one's life has no purpose or external meaning; Searching for the meaning of life; Shattering of one's sense of reality, or how the world is; An extremely pleasurable or hurtful experience that leaves one seeking meaning; Psychedlics Handling  gt;Peter Wessel , a Norwegian philosopher asserted in his book, The Last Messiah, four ways that he believed all self-conscious beings use in order to cope with their apprehension of indifference and absurdity in existence. * Anchoring the "fixation of points within, or construction of walls around, the liquid fray of consciousness". The anchoring mechanism provides individuals with a value or an ideal that allows them to focus their attentions in a consistent manner. (God, the Church, the State,...) * Isolation is "a fully arbitrary dismissal from consciousness of all disturbing and destructive thought and feeling". * Distraction occurs when "one limits attention to the critical bounds by constantly enthralling it with impressions". Distraction focuses all of one's energy on a task or idea to prevent the mind from turning in on itself. * Sublimation is the refocusing of energy away from negative outlets, toward positive ones. The individual distances themself and looks at their existence from an aesthetic point of view (e.g. writers, poets, painters).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The realized man is...  gt;Neither ordinary, nor extra-ordinary. Just being aware and affectionate -- intensely. He looks at himself without indulging in self-definitions and self-identifications. He does not know himself as anything apart from the world. He is the world. He is completely rid of himself, like a man who is very rich, but continually gives away his riches. He is not rich, for he has nothing; he is not poor, for he gives abundantly. He is just propertyless. Similarly, the realised man is egoless; he has lost the capacity of identifying himself with anything. He is without location, placeless, beyond space and time, beyond the world. Beyond words and thoughts is he. -Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj</TEXT>

Mymonero is easy but extremely unsafe, there are dozens, and dozens of people reporting about loosing their money. For small amounts its ok but to store your monero investment there is questionable.

    <TEXT>I'm astounded on how stark an effect the presence and absence of identity has on our perception and the state of being. Some rare times my identity submerges to which my perceptions changes dramatically. Things are perceived more intense and with more meaning. How does identity regulate or filter our perception? When ego is strong, we have a very narrow way of seeing. I used to think that in meditation by focusing on various sensations you increase perception and strengthen it. But actually now I think it is more the subsiding of identity that gives way to enhanced perception.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It is time we come to our sense, I know you want to defend your investment decisions and swipe away every thought that bitcoin can crash substantially and stay there. The hivemind right now is buy, buy, buy. People are way too euphoric. It is really unhealthy and I have witnessed other bubbles, where this mindset was present. You need to sober up, and not be blinded by recent gains of bitcoin. This dopamin rush isnt doing our reason any good. The best proof to me is that people react very defensive when you talk about bitcoin probably falling and staying there, this is to sin in the bitcoin community. I know it is your investment, but you got to stop seeing it personally and more objectively, what is going on right now is greed and euphoria unbased in the fundumentals. Bitcoins main purpose is still the darknetmarkets, there is where most bitcoin traffic comes from and the highest turnover is done. It makes sense to use a cryptocurrency there and no sense to try it with fiat. Other than that it fills very small niches.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>LSD trip turned challenging</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-12-25 00:29:05</DATE>
    <TEXT>I was in such an awe and full on it. Someone was with me that was sober and knew I was on. At one point something that he said I took personal, in my view he was condescending to me but there has been an issue in the past aswell. However from there it got challenging, I don't like terms like bad or horror so it was challenging. I didn't try to make it right forcefully. I however tried to side with the good, with love posivity and good intent. In the face of the challenge. There was an internal battle and it seemes like I was in the midst of it. Different forces arising. The good force, the hurt one, and so one. It was very challenging and got more so. Times came again and again were I was at ease completely. However challenging things kept coming in waves. I really want to spare you the details of this thoughts and images. It was not good. I turned to God. This internal battle was quite hard. All this positions and actors were there and I wasn't really any of them. At best I was the one to try not to let it go down to an extreme path. Now I am in bed and it is in the afterglow. Glow however isn't the right word for it. I never had a challenging trip. I am thankful however to have one, it could have been worse. Don't know why it had to come down this way. I am sort of hurt and vurnable now. I am thankful that I can turn to you, dear Psychonaut sub. Here, of all of reddit, you find people that are least judgmental, most understanding and accepting. So I feel good being able to write you, to turn to you in difficult times. I rather not talk to anyone personally with such very intimate personal stuff. Judgment or personal projections on to my own shit could really hurt. I guess when I take the blotter I accept that it may not go as I want it at all. I had 3 good trip so far, this one is the first challenging one. I have been challenging to my core, I didn't know what to do, even in surrender it was quite hard. The places your mind can go, oh dear. It wasnt a mind trip at first, it was one of being at first but when this personal shit came up, when I felt personally attacked, it became mental and stayed that way. Dear experienced Psychonauts what can you tell me? Tldr: perceived personal attack, trip went downhill, struggle how to deal, slowly more sober writing to you</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Why do you think it is that hundreds of millions of Americans take painkillers, anti-anxiety medication and sedatives? To get a brake from their mind, that is what it essentially comes down to. To forget our problems but there are no problems, the mind makes up endless problems, pokes us, torture us. In the extreme it drives one up to suicide. Eckhart Tolle said, experience suffering and pain, I cant life with myself anymore, meaning I cant live with my mind anymore. Why is it that people get into dangerous sports like downhill mountain bike and hill climbing? To be in the moment, where thoughts surpass. These dangerous activities take up all attention leaving no space for thoughts. Why is it that we meditate with "ommmmm" - we chant om to break the thought chatter. Instead of thoughts we hear om. We want peace of mind. I dont have a hundred problems, I have one: my mind. When I have piece of mind, I have no problems, no desires, no fears. No mind, is best mind.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Bad Trips viewed differently: Theory of positive disintegration</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-01-14 17:49:08</DATE>
    <TEXT>Here and there you read bad trips are good trips. The theory of positive disintegration can shed a light why that is: Why pain, distress, anxiety could be actually positive forces.The acute pain and distress can lead to the disintegration of ideas, behaviorial patterns, believes,... that are not chosen but accumulated in early childhood through impulse (so unconscious) or given through environment (parents, teachers,...). The disintegration of this traits gives you the chance to build consciously new one, that e.g. dont lead to pain or anxiety, that are motivated by love, goodwill and compassion. Theory of positive disintegration: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_disintegration Here to create means to destroy. This is what has been pointed to by many sages:  gt;But a day comes when you have amassed enough and must begin to build. Then sorting out and discarding are absolutely necessary. **Everything must be scrutinised and the unnecessary ruthlessly destroyed. Believe me, there cannot be too much destruction.** For in reality nothing is of value. Be passionately dispassionate -- that is all. -Sri N. Maharaj However be careful with this, I dont encourage bad trips at all. Rather than using a sledgehammer of psychedelics you could use the screwdriver of meditation taking everything apart. (Who am I?, Who is desiring X?, ..) Pain, distress, being lost, loosing all is to be expected. The dark night (of the soul) taps exactly into that. This path is dark indeed, be ready to be crushed, to be introduced to new levels of pain, pain so intense that you can not but be humble and sincere.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Why psychedelics are crucially important: rigidity of the mind</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-01-22 22:32:02</DATE>
    <TEXT>The mind is very rigid, when it comes to ideas, believes, opinions and the way we perceive the world. It tends to reinforce its believes and views rather to see things in a new way. It is here to see patterns in everything. To make distinctions: he is a democrat, he is republican. Mulism/Jew person. It adds to what is already here. Often we hold believes, ideas and opinions that are rather harmful to us and or others. We hold habits that are not helpful. Even if we want to change, the mind is habitual and doesn't let go of long held believes. Here is where psychedelics come into play BUT not only psychedelics. Often extreme events in our life can be that catalyst aswell. The death of a loved one, the loss of a job we held for a decade. These shocks force you sometimes into a state that is somewhat comparable to psychedelic state, though not that extreme. A nice example is the movie 127 Hours, where a man is stuck in between a rock and is about to die, he started having hallucinations and visions. This extreme situations and those hallucinations helped him cut off his own arm and therby survive. Now we are very rarely in such extreme conditions, of life and death. Psychedelics can help us get into such a state. It helps to loosen the tightness of mind. Help us question and see our long held believes and habits. When I think of ISIL fighters, I think are they never questioning what the hell they are doing. They have created hell on earth for themselves and the people who live in their territory. But they dont question, they have extremely strong held believes and ideas. They fight till their own death for this nonsense. They are victim of their own believes and worldview. I recently read a story here on reddit of a severely obese person, who was in a dire physical state and doctors kept telling him he cant live on like that, but he ignored them as he said and just kept eating himself to death. However he had a severe traffic accident one day which change him instantly. He started working out from that day on, lost weight to a healthy level, became a body builder. This extreme event helped him see everything in a new light. He was shocked into sanity. What the hell am I doing with my life? He became aware of the death, it wasnt just a concept anymore. An idea, everyone knows they will die. However we dont need such grand lessons and extreme experiences every week, thats why in my view, psychedelics should be taken rarely, otherwise they lose their power to transform, to wake up, to teach.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>See the mind as an organ</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-02-13 01:29:23</DATE>
    <TEXT>Bear with me for a while. Take the kidney for instance, it does its thing without the need of your conscious attention, it goes on by itself, whether we sleep or are awake it keeps going on its own. See the mind like that. When we meditate thoughts come up, did we choose to have these thoughts? Pink elephant. Did you choose to have this image appear in your mind? Thoughts come on their own. The mind does its thing. Thoughts that we give our attention to or have interest in keep coming up. Others die. The organ called mind does its thing , it brings up thoughts images, ponders and wonders. I know my mind, I am not my mind. I am conscious of my mind, I am not my mind. Mind works best when we don't interfere with it. When we want or reject something from mind, trouble is to set in. Look at your left hand. Are you your left hand? It's my hand, but clearly I am not my hand. The stream of thoughts. I am not the stream of thoughts. I am aware of my thoughts, aware of my hand. Yet I am beyond them. That which is present to thoughts, feelings, sensations, I am. Just wanted to share because I found it helpful to just let the mind do its thing and not try to play operator trying to keep all in order, because I can not. Let it express what it wants and be here as the presence.</TEXT>

They taxes the dividends and again when I sell the shares I have to pay again taxes. The bank cashes when I buy the shares, again when I sell everytime like 12USD. On top of that the fond charges 0.45% a year. I dont make shit of what originally should be paying 5% ROI. Fucking tierd of it, I guess I will put some money into bitcoin. With bitcoin I have to pay a 0.16% once while buying, once again at selling and like 60 cents to send the BTC around.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>What is it with alcohol?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-02-24 17:32:18</DATE>
    <TEXT>I dont understand it. It is the go-to drug for so many people, very widespread and heavily consumed. Socializing without it seems a no-go. But alcohol is one of the worst drugs I know. The dire physical effects on your body, strong addiction potential, damaging your liver, destroying some million neurons every time you get drunk and hard come down the next day. Some people get aggressive, do shit they regret, forget. I get people want to be loose and socialize easily, be silly and have fun together. There has to be a better choice though,..? A drug to make socializing easy, fun and lighthearted other than alcohol. There are so many drugs, what could be the alternative to alcohol while not having the dire negative effects of alcohol.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I write up some girls, when I get a response it's mostly only reactive like 'hi' 'haha' 'yes'. Don't know where to go from there. All I have is the pic of the girl and sometimes a one line of text. Asking random boring questions about what kind of movies, music you like is mundane and a waste of time. I'm not really interested in what movies they like or what hobbies they have. Also I notice most girl just react to any conversation starters. Like 'matrix' or 'coldplay' . Without following up on anything. This keeps going and going. I get that they are chatting with 10 guys at the same time and can't invest time in chatting but I'm not doing an interview or trying to see how you react to any given opinion, light hearted joke whatsoever. Online dating is a easy way to get into contact, the first step is so much easier than in rl but from there on it is often just a pain in the arse. After the 20th conversation you don't feel like you are talking to actual persons but to random pictures in the Internet, it gets so random.</TEXT>

I dont talk out of paralyzing fear, dont just say the first thing that comes in mind to get out of the conversation. I dont have non-stop self-judging, self-negative talk in my head. I enjoy talking, I crack a joke. I can attend to my shit. Unfortanetly I cant take the medication long-term. it fucks you up, you get addicted, it builds tolerance quickly. It is no solution at all. But it is nice to know what it feels like to be normal. I use it when I have a job interview, or any other important social meeting. Once I went to arrenge a marriage with a young good looking girl.

    <TEXT>Netflix was blackmailed by someone who threatened to release all episodes of the series "Orange is the New Back" if the ransom isnt paid (Moneros). This made me think. Are we with monero really on the right cause? It is blood money. Darknet markets use it to sell weapons and child porn. Government will crush it, if such incidents will keep occurring. Does anyone think they will stand on the sidelines when criminal have a perfect way to do their dirty business. If you think the government cant do anything, you are wrong. The have the best people, they have unlimited financial resources, they have tremendous computing power. I think they went to far with monero. They created a monster, that they cant control anymore. Monero will be the victim of its own success in privacy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>15 years of consequent pmo, day in day out. Unlimited supply of porn. Being alone in my apartment and able to do it nonstop - has brought me to this point. I realized I won't have ever a normal relation to sex and masturbation. I am like an alcoholic. You don't grow out of it. Alcohol will always be a poison to an alcoholic. The smallest thing can be a trigger. I stopped pm, for 2 months. But I allowed myself to have sex with girls, whenever I have the chance to. Being with various girls the past months showed me that my pmo habits are the same in sex with girls. I tend to want novelty with girls, or I have a hard time finishing. I get bored with the same girl quickly and need a another one to be able to finish. I binge and then am unable to finish if I don't increase into more extreme things. I carved a pattern of addiction in my brain by 15 years of unhinged pmo. How should I have a long term relationship with a sex life. If I get bored with the same girl after a week.</TEXT>

I have worked in banking, I know finance very well. I see through the bullshit and know many people. They are greedy as fuck and you can't think of the lengths they go.

Why does fluffy not make his holdings public as any ceo does???? ????? ?? ? Please people, start thinking. We need critical shareholders. Member enron? Member worldcom? I member. Both went under because the big guy was a crook. How were they caught? Enron by a whistle-blower... Anyone with information please report to me.

Not only has Bitcoin come to a scaling consensus, only to discover that it #160;wasn #8217;t really a consensus #160;and that a chain split might be coming, but Monero has had its share of action too, with its lead developer/spokesperson #160;causing a stir #160;over a stunt where he promised a major announcement only to reveal it was all a joke, causing the price to spike and then subsequently crash. Now some in a divided community are #160;calling for him to be fired. Say a developer or development decision is controversial. How do we know that the community, as a whole, objects? We can conduct polls, watch social media activity, etc., however that can be easily gamed through a determined effort, as we #8217;ve seen with concentrated troll campaigns in Bitcoin.

One DNM Admin told that he is very annoyed with bitcoin and wont wait for August first to see improvement. They are working on adding an altcoin. They hate the high fees and extremly slow TXs. To remove the only real use of bitcoin would be very bad. This is just one more spot where bitcoin is loosing the advantage of being the first.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>The pump and dump</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-06-10 23:17:11</DATE>
    <TEXT>Been seeing this again and again with various coins. I want to bring up an example, if I may. STRATIS. It jumped from 1.5 to 11 USD withhin a couple of days. Now it has been on the loosing street for 3 consecutive days. It is now at 7.5 USD. Not a big loss you might think. Many people bought in at 8++ USD. They are in the shit right know. The way I know the markets, Stratis will keep loosing. It certainly wont fall back to 1.5 USD but it will lose significantly. I have seen this too many times. Why are market participants acting like that. Pump and dump again. As if it is coordinated. Many people are hurt by this. Many people are chasing the high, fear of missing out, you know. I dont know what people are saying, unfortunately the Polo trollbox is closed. I used to be on Polo for hours a day, 40k traders were only at any given time. I am out of the loop, any new rumors?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I feel reddit isnt isnt a good representation of the market, the coins people are excited about here, the market doesnt care to much about. They dont really pump hard. The market is irrational, so it doesn't have to make sense, I want to have a good feel for the herd mentality. Where are the masses moving towards? I used to like Polo Trollchat for that reason. I need to get in touch with the mass of market players. Jump into the pump and dump train. I am not willing to be a bagholder for whales anymore, I dont want to catch falling knives. I want to ride the trend.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>We have seen lately stratis go through the roof, Bitshares and now antshares. Instead of chasing the high, and jumping onto the coins that had a pump, let's try anticipate which coins will pump hard next. Most likely. There will definitely be other coins that will see such huge gains. It's simply the herd mentality jumping from one coin to another. Alot of noobs who get in late trying to chase the high, end up as bagholders for whales. My guess would be ardor, factom or steem. I see a possibility of them going parabolic.</TEXT>

Which groups can you recommend and share?? I recommend the bot crypto alert. Which alerts you of unusual market move movements like sudden increase in volume, price etc. So you won't miss any pump anymore. We all know the feeling of having missed out the current pump.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2017-06-26 21:08:14</DATE>
    <TEXT>I read an investment book the other day that discussed the telltale signs of bubbles before they are about to burst. It compared the recent crashes in both the housing market and the dot-com bubble. The main take-away was that right before both of these bubbles burst, EVERYONE was aware of the money that could be made, and  #8216;dumb #8217; or  #8216;unaware #8217; was pouring in left, right, and centre. The mainstream was well aware of the profit-potential in these markets, and that hype added to the crash. The good news for us is that whilst we #8217;ve seen some outrageous profits, the general public is still largely unaware! We may be going through a slight bear market, but rest your weary heads, for the bubble has not burst #8230; yet.</TEXT>

When I read in the forums, subs there is pessimism everywhere. The tables have turned. A month ago everone was crypto is the future and it will be huge. The sentiment has turned 100%. The fundamentals have not. Fear is widespread and everybody believes the market will go down further. It will, because it is a self full filling prophecy. People are waiting for it to go down further before putting money in. We have to wait till the sentiment changes back to a more bullish view again for a rise. Maybe the successful bitcoin scaling can be that igniter.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Netflix needs to focus on quality content, not quantity Netflix #8217;s  #8220;throw-everything-at-the-wall-and-see-what-sticks #8221; It is favouring quantity over quality. Netflix #8217;s original content has always been weak. They have a VC approach to funding shows- they'll fund a bunch of crap, in hopes that one show is a unicorn. Which is why for every 20 Netflix shows you only hear of one. Barely. Netflix built its content model to favor quantity over quality. Hence many shows are plain terrible. But with such a wide user base, users are likely to find something to watch. Even if it's mediocre.</TEXT>

New shiny coin, everyone says how this is the most promising coin and going great places, it's just the beginning. Xlm went from 10th to 33th. It is only worth a fifth of its value.

Often at times of high volume is when you need the exchange the most. They fucking get paid on every trade, they charge more than 0.5% of the trading volume. I wont accept that adding hardware to handle more traffic is so hard or expensive. Kraken has even gone so far to remove some trading pairs, to decrease traffic.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sources close and inside Amazon are saying that Amazon is soon to accept bitcoin payments. Rumors have been going on the last few weeks now even an official Amazon employee taps into those claims. It is said amazon will use an exchange rate that is somewhat below the big exchanges like bitfinex. This is great news. People have lot of gains stuck in btc and can't cash in because they would need to pay taxes. This is a perfect way out without having to pay taxes. Bitcoin experts and unnamed market insiders are saying it will have a strong positive effect on the rate of bitcoin. An anonymous source claims Amazon will only accept upfront payments if you pay with btc. People in the darknet communities say Amazon is the first of many big online retailers to include bitcoin this year.</TEXT>

The mempool should be empty for high-priority TXs like moving your coins off the exchange or to the exchange, moving your coins to a cold storage and so on. For Bitcoin Investors basically, those people strengthen bitcoin, the buy bitcoin making the price go higher, thats what we are looking for in Bitcoin. Also Darknet Market TXs are high-priority because those people dont have a choice but use bitcoin, it is a real world usage of bitcoin.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Our brain works very strongly with repetition and habits. Whatever you do over and over again becomes automatic, becomes habit, becomes subconscious. Take 10 to think about what you are grateful for, you will also feel this warm positive feeling. Your thoughts influce your feelings and your feelings influence your thoughts. What you fuel becomes stronger. I don't like the saying fake it till you make it either but what I was trying to say is councoiusly cultivate those thoughts. Meaning think purposely of things you are thankful for, even though they didn't appear to you by chance. Purposely think of the good attributes of the people around you. Good luck by finding root causes, you can spend all your life chasing the negative and trying to find root causes also called therapy. There is a reason you see people going for decades to therapy and not seeing the end of it. I agree for certain traumatic, triggering negative thoughts and emotions to sit with and accept. But your everyday negativity like judging, jealousy, anger, envy and so are only fueled by occupying yourself all the time with those thoughts. Give interest to a thought and it will grow and reappear in your councoiusness over and over again. This is the way our brain works. When you give importance to something the brain thinks this is essential to my survival/wellbeing and becomes more alert to those things. You can be trained to see the negative in everything or the positive. The brain has extremely powerful filters and is very strong in finding patterns. You choose what patterns you want to see. Perception is highly subjective and personal. There is no reality, only different way of looking at things.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thank you. I see it the same way. The way things move, how you are lead from one thing to another, how one event causes another is very intresting and in hindsight it often makes perfect sense, it is as if you have been lead to some point. It is as everything is leading you torwards growing, the flowering of your spirituality, awakening. Its not a straight line thought, there are setbacks and tests at the way. Yesterday after posting here, I was so in pain and there was strong yearning in me, I went to my book shelf and looked at my books, if there was anything that could provide relief. I found a book I never read: "The power of your subconscious mind" You wouldn't think it is spiritual but it is very much. Now I have something I can believe in. https://www.amazon.com/Power-Your-Subconscious-Mind/dp/160459201X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books amp;ie=UTF8 amp;qid=1507137295 amp;sr=1-1 amp;keywords=murphy+power</TEXT>

I believe long term in crypto. Everybody should be able to profit. Make it to the masses. I am not saying it to people for my own gain, but because I have the very strong inherent trust that crypto is here to stay and be great. BTC have been around for 7 years now and it is not going anywhere. It will go up later or sooner. Its not about the price only though, it is the next step after papermoney. gold- gt;paper- gt;crypto.

    <TEXT>Amazon accepting BTC would give people a way out without paying taxes. You can either buy stuff directly at amazon, they sell basically anything. Or you can buy thousands of dollars of gift cards and sell them at craigslist for 95%. another way would be to set up a fake store, buy your own shit from that store. lose a couple of percent to amazon but the rest is yours. lets hustle lets do some brainstorming you guys, how can you get your money out without losing too much? give me anything, we are just throwing ideas around, but I dont want to pay more than 5%. I want the money out without paying taxes, now is not a good time for me to pay taxes: i will pay in sale taxes and other taxes. but the capital gain tax is not right for me, at this point in my life.</TEXT>

Everything above 9% is insane, how should a coin rise if they throw so much at the market. Supply and demand make the prices. I dont think it is fair how much coins they spew out, aint nobody need so much coins. Reward people for buying and holding coins. LTC could be at 200 USD if they wouldnt print coins like crazy. On April they still had an Inflation rate of 18%. The halving made it better but it is still too high.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It was never about actual use or good fundamentals. The new most shiny coins got pumped to the moon and the dumped, and then dumped, and dumped. See FCT, ICN, SIA, STRAT, ... Nobody cares about those coins anymore, I remember how back in the day people were shilling those coins everywhere, they were talked about so much. I saw the same with LISK and ARK. They have just recently come to the end of their life, they will suffer and long and slow deadly recline. The fundamentals didnt change but people are looking for the next shiny coin. The next kick, the next thing that could pump 10x. Learn about the cycle of a coin history. I am one of the best traders, I dont give alot of attention to fundementals, team or use. I work the market. I watch charts, volume, excitement, market buzz. I make the best trades.</TEXT>

Of course I was prepared knowing such kind of deals are risky and shady people you have to deal with. I was carrying my peper spray with me. I sparyed all of them and ran as quickly as I could.

I would like to be assualted by young, skinny females all day long. Bring it on.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No I didnt. And if you want to destroy peoples career, name and make them lose everything you got to start with Trump. There are many allegations against Trump, where are you people? Where is the outrage at Trump? Why didnt he lose anything? Kevin is a good hearted man, he would never do that and it is a shame he is falling victim to a vicious person who makes up such lies. Kevin gives so much, he donated 20 million dollar to different causes. Trump steals money from charity. This sexual allegation thing is a war against liberal hollywood. trying to destroy good people.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>First it was Sia, you had so many threads about Sia every single day, all Sia posts would get upvoted very much, there was a huge buzz and it seemed as Sia is here to stay. Which coins to look out for, to invest? Sia, Sia, Sia! We had a short but very intense wave of antshares (NEO). Then came a wave of LISK/ARK. A lot of excitement, would make you think that was huge beyond imagination. Then there was Vertcoin, it came on slowly but steadily and seems to be over its peak now. As people are shifting their interest towards grostlcoin, which seems to be still in its early ages. There is a pump cycle, the dump consists of simply not talking about it, making you think it doesnt exist anymore. Here and there some bagholder complain but overall its like a project that failed. There are some major coins that are not part of this cycle like ETH, BTC, LTC, XRP, XMR. The big ones, that are not victim to the pump and dump scheme. Often you can make money following the hype and trend, but make sure to get out soon enough, or you will be left holding bags for years or taking a heavy hit.</TEXT>

Many times people confess to murder, rape and all sort of things without ever doing anything. You need to do some reading up. Google it, there are even documentaries about that topic. Of course he didnt do it. He confessed to it, but didnt do it. There are many reasons to confess to something you havent done. In this case he was pressured from managment, bosses and to protect his buisnesses. It is a witchhunt, it is a knive women use. Imaging you as a male having such power over all females. just by claiming something you can destroy them, get millions, blacknail them, get roles, get jobs, get money and fame. Of course they are going to use it. They say women kill in secret their choice of weapon is poision. they do it secretly and cheat and lie to get their enemies killed.</TEXT>

Why dont you just annouce what you have to say, instead saying on friday something very big will be coming. SIA reached its ATH at that day in June. There are darknet communities selling inside info, havent buy in yet, because they charge 0.4-0.8 BTC for a single info but people buying in were happy and I checked their BTC wallets, they really had the 0.4 BTC coming in from many sources. There is a ton of shady things going on. We are the peasants who get fucked and are happy at our 20% gain.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>woman have found a new power, making accusations to get their way. its not new. in my country we had recently a rape case. a young girl was raped by two brown skinned guys. the police took it very serious because the public also was shocked and intrested. so the police did everything they could to solve the case, any hint could be helpful. they talked a lot with the victim, what she was saying was contracting at times. after some talks with the police she admitted to making up the rape. why? because she was late from going out with friends and made up that story for her parents. this is a lucky case, mostly the rapes are just believed and police stuck with not a shred of evidence. just like with all the cases we have with actors and powerful men. when you are at the top, you make enemies. women have always historcially chosen weapons of manipulation and deceive. There is no sexual assualt and 90% of rape cases are made up. it really is a shame that this allegations are taken seriously. i am not a loser, i lead a normal life with everything, it just so happens that you dont share my view, cant blame you, you are a woman. so naturally you will agree to anything that says women are victims.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>They are burning 400 million dollar on one season. It won't work. You just can't throw money at a creative project and expect it to be good. HBO knows what it is doing, it has been in the business for 40 years and they know the creative process from step one and are very involved in it. Netflix and Amazon just don't know what they are doing, they are tech companies. Disclaimer I work at HBO middle management</TEXT>

To me sending money for 50 cents is already a lot, so i didnt wnat to pay more. still waiting after nearly a week for my TX to go through. But I see that even tX with 3-4 dollars in fee arent getting through. This is a really shitty system. Bitcoin is a poor excuse for a currency. they calculated that every TX amounts to 290 kilowatt in energy usage. if VISA would waste that much energy to handle a TX, you would need all the worlds energy. it is wasteful, expensive and slow. extremly inefficient system.</TEXT>

I like my girl but if she decides on some hormonal changes she wants to run away to some goon, she defineatly wont see a single dime. She will be fucked or she will have to start working for herself. I dont expect to get paid by a female after divorce, women need to lose that entitlement mentality. Aint nothing like a free lunch.

    <TEXT>This guy is out for experience, he wants to experience all that there is before he dies. The most exclusive, special experience is in tripping.

Get blasted completely out of earth before you death does it for you. This is the video on reddit that I am refering to: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D9n3mPCp-c amp;feature=youtu.be</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A story about this Master from wikipedia:  gt;Neem Karoli Baba or Baba Lakshman Das (Alt. spelling: Laxman Das), as he was known then, left his home in 1958. He boarded a train without a ticket and the conductor decided to halt the train and force Neem Karoli Baba off of the train at the village of Neeb Karori. After kicking Baba off of the train the conductor found that the train would not start again. After several attempts at starting the train someone suggested to the conductor that they allow the sadhu back on to the train. Neem Karoli agreed to board the train only if the railway company could promise to build a station at the village of Neeb Karori. The officials agreed and Neem Karoli Baba boarded the train, jokingly saying, "what is it up to me to start trains?" Immediately after his boarding the train, it started, but the train drivers would not proceed unless the sadhu blessed them to move forward. Baba gave his blessings and the train proceeded. Later a train station was built at the village of Neeb Karori. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neem_Karoli_Baba</TEXT>

    <DATE>2017-12-08 10:46:09</DATE>
    <TEXT>I am sorry, I really dont like to hate on ETH but it has been nothing but a disappointment. Just recently bought some ETH for the first time. I thought Bitcoin was crappy with long TXs times, high fees but boy ETH is really something special. But let me get specific: * TXs that are made simply dont show up anywhere and cant be found * the given TXID (wallet MEW or exchange) cant be found on the blockexplorer, you have no clue what is going on * after a dozen hours (13h) the ETH shows suddenly up in my wallet, TXID still doesnt show up, blockexplorer doesnt show wallet TXs * despite decent fees hours and hours of waiting * made a TX from MEW. ETHs are subtracted, TX cant be found, Walletadress doesnt show a TX has been made * next day the TX still not there but suddenly the ETH are in the wallet available (so I can send them again?) - what a MESS * shitty wallets, no decent destop wallet, have to download 100gb blockchain, not one single smart contract desktop wallet for windows w/o downloading the whole fucking blockchain * only web-based wallet MEW - at every step the password/file has to be put in, extremely uncomfortable to use, no history, no nothing * TX dont go into pending TXs, you have no clue what is going on, its not transparent * there is no decent way to calculate what fee will get you a quick TX unlike BTC where you can use Johoes Site to calculate exact fees All in all the experience has been VERY bad and even though BTC is very slow (so is ETH) and expensive. the usability is WAY better.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Naja, muss ja so sein, Geringverdiener zahlen kaum Steuern, haupts #228;chlich SV-Beitr #228;ge. Wie kann es eine Steuerentlastung geben, wenn man kaum/keine Lohnsteuer zahlt? Es muss nicht so sein sondern es wurde ganz bewusst so gew #228;hlt. Man h #228;tte genauso gut die Sozialversicherungsbeitr #228;ge senken k #246;nnen statt steuern und nicht nur um 5-20 Euro im Monat. Sie wissen schon ganz genau was sie tun. Es geht eben darum jene mehr zu geben die ohnehin schon viel haben. Die brauchen es aber am wenigsten. Inwiefern lohnt sich Leistung wenn man f #252;r Vollzeit 1500 Brutto im Monat bekommt? Gerade dort muss angesetzt werden. Was hat der jenige mit 1500 Brutto davon wenn die Mindestsicherung noch viel weniger als sein Lohn ist? Sein Lohn ist viel zu gering um damit halbwegs leben zu k #246;nnen, daf #252;r das man 40h/Woche arbeiten geht. Die  #214;VP entscheidet sich dazu Milliarden auszugeben um einer kleinen Gruppe viel Geld zu geben und wenn es um die unteren Einkommen geht, ist kein Geld da, kein Spielraum.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ich kann es nicht fassen, nach den Erfahrungen in Deutschland m #246;chte Schwarz-Blau Hartz IV in  #214;sterreich einf #252;hren. Man spart sich dadurch wenig, verursacht aber viel soziale Not und soziale K #228;lte. Wozu? Die Regierung m #246;chte die MWSt f #252;r Hoteliers um 3% senken, Steuerfreie Milliarden f #252;r gro #223;e Konzerne und Steuersenknungen f #252;r Besserverdiener. Kosten von mehr als ein dutzend Milliarden aber bei den sozial schw #228;chsten muss jeder Cent umgedreht werden? Wenn man mit 50 den Job verliert heutzutage dann kommt man nur mehr sehr schwer wieder in einen neuen Job, mit Hartz IV in  #214;sterreich setzt man diese Leute in Existenznot. Asozialer geht es nicht. Das soziale Sicherungsnetz das wir haben wird zerst #246;rt. Mindestsicherung, Arbeitslosengeld, Notstandshilfe, die letzten Sicherungsnetzte werden zerst #246;rt - die Ersparnis ist kaum der Rede Wert - wenn man dann Arbeitslos ist, ist man ein Bettler, kein Arbeitssuchender mehr - denn wenn die Existenz am spiel steht dann wird jeder Ausbeuterjob genommen. Genau darum geht es, willige und billige Arbeitnehmer f #252;r die Wirtschaft schaffen. Die Angst haben vor Jobverlust, denn dann k #246;nnten sie alles verlieren. Alles mit machen, alles akzeptieren. Konzerne, Unternehmer sollen rauspressen was geht. Das ist die Wahrheit. Der 12h Arbeitstag kommt und Hartz IV. Alle Steuersenkungen gehen an Einkommen  #252;ber 3000 Brutto. 1,5 Mio Menschen arbeiten in  #214;sterreich f #252;r unter 2000 Brutto.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You can choose Google 2-FA at Kraken for withdrawals/deposits, but you simply remove 2-FA without entering the 2-FA Code, if you are logged in. Whats the point of 2-FA then? You can simply bypass it by removing it. *Kraken is a prominent, US-based cryptocurrency exchange operating in Canada, the EU, Japan, and the US, and "the world's largest bitcoin exchange in euro volume"*</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So does any other exchange. But if I want to remove 2-FA at other Exchanges I need the current 2-FA Code. What Kraken does is like being able to change your E-Mail password just by being logged in, without typing in your current password. We are talking about an exchange where people are storing assets, assets that can be stolen without being tracked down. This is a joke as a security meassure. You have to type in a 2-FA Code to withdraw, but you can also simply remove the 2-FA and withdraw without any 2-FA code.</TEXT>

While I am secretly enjoying my XMRs. Listen to me, I know men who had a divorce, they are scared for life. Dont think I am happily married why would I be doing that? You need to prepare for the worst. I could be thinking I leave all my BTC on coinbase, they are secure, coinbase insures customers assets so I am fine, no I take my BTC off coinbase, if they go down and all hell breaks lose, I am still in the green.

    <TEXT> gt; the cost for it is hidden in the price of your purchase every and all thing is "hidden" in the price of the product. I do not pay a single dime and it is instant for me. it makes a huge different if I pay the TX or someone else. i pay with CC, I pay no fee - pay with BTC pay a huge fee. This is money out of my pocket. if I pay with paypal many vendors in my country charge extra costs, if you pay via bank transfer they dont charge anything. what you need to understand is that it matters WHO pays. saying all is in the price of the product is foolish. I can choose my bank, which varies in costs from free to dozens of USD a month. I can choose my payment method, which also can be free or costs up to several dollars. I choose free, everytime. Make it free and I use it. Why is Alipay so successful? It is free. as to segwit: get exchanges and wallets to support it, then I use it. as long as it isnt supported I wont/cant use it. I am no developer and no bitcoin activists, this is not my problem, you gotta make it comfortable for the consumer.</TEXT>

I never took down the little keylogger i plugged in between my pc and keyboard. now a couple of months a ago a friend logged into his crypto stash. The thing is I am no longer friends with him anymore and I thought I clear his stash. Is it enough too use TOR? the thing about keyloggers is, you never know how they will be useful in the future. when I was with my GF, I didnt need a netflix account, but when she left, it come in very handy I collected the data.

    <TEXT>When they read parts of his books in the library. Where he spoke about how killing arouses him sexually and he was wondering how easy you could get away with it. Combine that with the homosexual sex stories with military men in his "fictional" books - clearly autobiographical remarks. As a men I can say: Men do really, really stupid things when they are horny and some men get turned on by crazy shit. His turn on was killing. The power he felt over his victim. Women need to understand that when you are horny or sex driven you are not in your right mind. Michael is a sick perverted monster.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The novel is a vital part, too sad they couldn't read it to the jury. It is so perverted and appalling. Being bisexual has nothing to do with it, I just mentioned the homosexual sex with military men in his book to show that his fictional work is related to his personal life. You should read the parts where he writes about killing, the way he writes about killing a person, as if it is a sex act. Take this and the whole story together and it is very clear. The books show his dark thoughts, the thoughts he cant speak as MP but put in a fictional book.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Why is this written dark fantasy vital here? MP and his wife were a loving couple, as testified by many people. There is no motive why he would kill, no financial motive or any other. His works as an author gives it a motive. A sexual pleasure in killing. Futher he writes about how it feels to kill the first time and that it awakes a desire for more. And he was wondering how easy you could get away with it in his work. Why is the homo sex important? I dont care about gay sex at all, why I mention it here is because it shows that his works as an author have autobiographical relations. The military gay sex is clearly something in his own life.</TEXT>

Es kam zu gewaltigen Streikaktionen, die mittelfristig auch zu Verbesserungen der Arbeitssituation der Lohnabh #228;ngigen f #252;hrten. In Gro #223;britannien beispielsweise war der Zehnstundentag bereits 1848 gesetzlich festgeschrieben worden, was die Kapitalisten allerdings nicht daran hinderte, Kinder illegal bis zu 18 Stunden t #228;glich arbeiten zu lassen. Unsere V #228;ter und Gro #223;v #228;ter haben hart daf #252;r gek #228;mpft, sie haben teilweise mit Blut daf #252;r gezahlt, dieser Kampf hat  #252;ber ein dutzend Jahre gedauert. Sie haben sich gegen reiche Industrielle und Fabriksbesitzer durchgesetzt. Der heutige Arbeitnehmer und FP #214; W #228;hler ist zu verw #246;hnt, er genie #223;t all die Vorteile die m #252;hselig erk #228;mpft wurden. 5 Wochen Urlaub, bezahlter Krankenstand, 13. und 14.

    <TEXT>Yes, meditation does lower motivation and drive, but it isnt necessarily a bad thing. we have to look at what drives us to do things. what are the rewards we are looking for, why are we doing what we are doing. rewards could be pleasure, social recognition, social status, prestige, satisfaction, happiness, well-being. Meditation brings satisfaction, well-being, contentedness, fullness from within. When I am full, when I dont lack anything I am not searching anymore, I am not following any fatamorgana anymore. I am not chasing things that never bring satisfaction, I am not chasing the next kick. I am happy and content just being, I am full to the brim. What can add to my state and why? I fall out of the rat race. I am a bad consumer, I am not increasing GDP. I am at rest, at peace. People chasing money, fame, status are like thirsty people drinking salt water. I am independent, mind is not restless to look for the next fix, the next distraction. This is real freedom. There is no attachment because nothing adds to me or diminish me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Anyone who can experience this fullness knows exactly why you have no drive to do something. When Eckhart Tolle got enlightend he spent 2 years sitting on park benches. This is inner fullness. Rarely we get to experience it to this degree but meditation brings more well-being into our live, helping us to let go of some misguided, unnecssary striving</TEXT>

I do what is necessary to get ahead. But I am a good person, I am a high quality person. I think you are just jelly and thats why you call me a douche. I know people, many don't.

My thinking was that in an concentrated efforth we inflitrate various communities and push crypto. We glow for crypto and advertise crypto. We do this in all big communities. NYT comments, r/finance and so on. Perpection is everything. We need new fresh fiat money to come into the market to make more gains. I think we agree that everybody wants gains. Push crypto everywhere, in work, to your neighbors, relatives. Dont be lazy if you want to make money. Play the people, make promises, exaggerate, everything goes.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm in the business of making money, I worked in sales before. The first thing you learn is ABC. Always be closing. Make the sale. My boss said I dont care how you get there, what you have to do to make the sale. Make the sale. I want to make more commission. Look out for yourself first. Ever heard of self-intrest. Always make sure you are looking out for your self-interest. Otherwise you get rolled over, there are some cunning people out there. They are always one step ahead of you. If you want to get ahead in life, you have to be more cunning, smater. I once put up an tutorial here how you can use payment by crypto to make huge amounts of money. Let people pay with crypto using your deceive only and offer then 20% off or something to incentivize paying with crypto. With a keylogger and datagrabber you can then clear their stash. This isnt even illeagle, it is only a tax on being dumb. There are many ways to make money, you just have to be cunning. Mr. Trump isnt smart or anything. He is just very cunning. Now he is president and worth 500-2000 million dollar (depending on source) and has sex with the hottest models and playmates. He is a winner! I am a winner! Trump is my role model. I want to have sex with girls like melania and ivanka one day. I want to be untouchable one day like trump.</TEXT>

I am involved in all sorts of things. Like on thing I really like is selling amazon gift cards, legit ones, for 105%-110% of the original price. ? they want to use that money but cant sell it on a fait exchange. this is where i come in. In 2017 I printed a lot of money with crypto, I got into a craze. What would you have done if you had a money printer? you would run it at 100% 24/7. With the recent downfall I lost part of the profits. It hurts. I want my money back. My friend told me before the downfall, the market will turn and you have to learn to make money off a bear market. I borrowed BTC for 5% intrest and sold it. now i have to buy back that BTC in two months, hopefully for a cheaper price. I sell and buy back later for a cheaper price. I need more profits, I want to go to thailand again and enjoy thai-girls.</TEXT>

It depends on the setting, if you meet a girl in a club/bar its no big deal if you dont pay, it doesnt matter, you can get laid. In a formal date setting, going out for the first or second time, it increases your chances significantly if you pay. No girl likes a cheap fuck who doesnt want to pay the bill, they wont tell you but they always want it. They want a genours man who insists on paying because it shows them she means something to you. The bigger the bill, the more you can demand a return on your investment. If she doenst want you to pay it is because she doesnt want to owe you, she knows if she dines on your bill sooner than later she has to put out. Girls are easy, just ignore 95% of what they say and give attention to the 5% that count.</TEXT>

All legal though and it nets good money, so I can feed my family. I wont apologize for coming up with ingenious ways to make money. People should be thankful that I publicly share my money printing ideas for free. I should be selling them in the darknet for money, you wouldnt believe how much you can make as a vendor selling ebooks, I am personally not but some people are. People just dont understand that it all comes down to making money. Did you know that working is the worst way to make money? Many people dont know that. I always wanted quick and easy money. I am not cut out to work hard 8 hours a day as a wage slave. While I worked in sales I learnt a lot, I got to understand that it is not about working hard but about being cunning.

What do they have going for themselves expect "Stranger Things" and "Ozark"? Netflix has made a reputation for greenlighting everything.

    <TEXT>People are trying to predict price action from past price development. yeah in the past the price fell by 80% then went to new ATHs that were 10x or more. I really believe this time it wont be like that. Just because in the past it was like that doesnt mean it will be in the future. we had a market cap of 800bn which is simply crazy. the money you need to reach that again or even go beyond that wont be here. this craze wont repeat itself.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Many darknet vendors are losing money. After you order the money is in an escrow and you dont get it up until the customer finalizes the order. All the while BTC has fallen some 10-15%. they have to carry that loss. They arent happy. Ideally you would have a currency like USDT, that has a fixed rate.</TEXT>

Someone who goes to Buterin and builds pressure to make sure more is done for investors. As of now our intrests are not properly being represented. Investor value should be the top issue for ETH and Buterin. First we demand Proof of stake, we demand to rebuy and burn ETH, we demand that hodlers get rewarded. Coins that havent moved from a wallet in the past 12 months should be rewarded. Wallets get taxed with 0.2% to gather money for marketing budget. Atttract new investors, make ads, make promises.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I propose a yearly 0.2% Monero tax on all funds on any given wallet. The tax is automatically deducted and sent to cooperate. The money will be used for marketing to secure new investors, to get more fiat into XMR. A new big marketing campain will be set with aggressive marketing, making big return promises, showing that monero is dark money. Another part of the money will be used to help darknet marketplaces in developing and implementing monero. Another part will be used to pay exchanges to list monero, exchanges who doesnt list monero as coinbase. Another part of the money will be used to build and set up monero ATMs. People can come in and put their cash anonymously into XMR. We dont care if it is drug money, all fiat is welcome. perfect way to tunnel your money into XMR without the goverment getting in your way. I am willing to set all this up, I have worked for many icos and have been a consultant for many coins. I have led many coins to great success and big gains. My services arent free but they pay for themself by strong gains in the price of monero.</TEXT>

Decentralization is good but we still need investor values. ultimately we all want more money. I am not sure if Buterin is the right person to help us get there. Usually you would have a board now who dumps Buterin. I like the managment of the coin MOD, I would like to hire them as a replacement for Buterin.

    <TEXT>In a way I am joking but I am serious about it. I am very unhappy with the leaders of some of the biggest coins. Lets take a look: Charlie Lee, leader of LTC, he had a real good marketing strategy and he pushed LTC with his tweets very nicely, always being very bullish. He sold at close to 400 US-Dollars all his stash which is believed to be around 35 Million dollar. From those ATHs LTC sank, before BTC, and kept falling. Charlie Lee did not push LTC further after he sold, his tweets were of different nature. He betrayed investors. Lets look at the leader of Monero, XMR, called fluffy. This is a young guy who is basically a troll. This gentlemen was active in the sick board of 4chan.org. He enjoys trolling and betraying his investors. many sources claim he is involved in insider trading and market manipulation. Buterin is a person that I would never let go and talk in public. He is a disgrace. We need to get a serious PR-Manager in a suit and send him talk for ETH. Buterins choice of cloths and public behaivour are deeply troubling. He hurts the brandname ETH.</TEXT>

Zum Zweck der  #8222;Spin-Control #8220; werde Expertise und Informationsaustausch im Stellungnahmeverfahren unterbunden. Nachhaltige Folgen werde das aber nicht haben, denn der Verfassungsgerichtshof werde das Gesetz so gut wie sicher aufheben, meinte Jarolim.  gt;Dieses Begutachtungsverfahren war  #8222;das skurrilste der Republik #8220; - hat doch das Umweltministerium seine Stellungnahme zum Entwurf des Wirtschaftsministeriums nicht ver #246;ffentlicht und der im Justizministerium angesiedelte Verfassungsdienst gar keine abgegeben.  gt;Kanzler Sebastian Kurz ( #214;VP) habe den Beamten offenbar ein  #8222;Schweigegel #252;bde #8220; auferlegt, um zu verhindern, dass verfassungsrechtliche Probleme des Regierungsvorhabens offengelegt werden. Jarolim sieht auch den Generalsekret #228;r im Justizministerium, Christian Pilnacek ( #214;VP), gefordert:  #8222;Ein Generalsekret #228;r m #252;sste daf #252;r einstehen, dass angelagerte Beh #246;rden nicht auf Druck bzw. aus unsachlichen  #220;berlegungen vor Stellungnahmen zur #252;ckschrecken. #8220; orf.at Sebastian Kurz ist so ein widerw #228;rtiger Typ da w #252;nsche ich mir den Wolfgang Sch #252;ssel wieder, selbst der Spindelegger oder Pr #246;ll wirken gegen den sympathisch und offen. Kurz arbeitet mit Lug, Betrug, T #228;uschen und Blenden. Die  #214;VP hat Reinhold Mittelehner gegen so ein PR-Spindokotor und Selbstdarsteller getauscht? Der Mittellehner war einer der ganz wenigen aufrichtigen, ehrlichen in der  #214;VP der etwas f #252;r  #214;sterreich erreichen wollte, anders als Kurz der f #252;r sein Ego und Selbstbild arbeitet und keine Scheu hat daf #252;r jeden vor den Bus zu werfen.

Somit ist er ein sehr guter Politiker, er hat die ganze  #214;VP  #252;bernommen und seine Sektenmitglieder installiert. Aber gut f #252;rs Land ist er nicht. Es ist eine Schande das die  #214;VP Mittellehner gegen so ein Blender getauscht hat.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Die Leute sind da, die wirst du nur  #228;u #223;erst schwer wieder los. Wir sehen mal wieder in Deutschland, USA und  #214;sterreich wie schwer es ist Leute wieder abzuschieben. zB wenn die jungen Afghaner eine Lehre beginnen. Die halbe  #214;VP ist bereits dagegen, ebenso WKO. Wenn es also keine aussicht gibt und die Abschiebung droht. Lehre starten. In Deutschland haben wir den Fall vom Body-Guard von Binladen. Der abgeschoben worden ist, und die gerichte dann angeordnet haben er muss wieder hergebracht werden. Es gibt zwei gangbare Wege und das sind die einzigen zwei. 1.) Freiwillige R #252;ckehr 2.) System so umbauen das keiner mehr kommen will. 1) Gro #223;e Kampange starten daf #252;r, finanzielle Anreize f #252;r freiwillige R #252;ckkehr. Jeder Fl #252;chtling der Grundversorgung beziehen m #246;chte muss alle 6 Monate einmal zur freiwilligen R #252;ckkehr beratung kommen, wo ihm das schmackhaft gemacht wird. FAmiliennachzug wird praktisch unm #246;glich gemacht, das hat .DE eingef #252;hrt und darauf sind viele Fl #252;chtlinge zur #252;ck. K #246;nnen nicht ohne ihre Familien hier leben. Gro #223;z #252;giger sein bei den finaziellen Anreizen. Kann schon mal 3500-4000 Euro f #252;r eine Person sein, inkl Ticket. Den es kommt immer noch deutlich billiger als Ausbildung, Gesundheit, Wohnung, Monatslohn zu finanzieren. 2) Asylsystem unattraktiv machen. Die Regeln f #252;r die Quatiere  #228;ndern. Derzeit wird pro person zuviel m #178; gegeben. Ich kann mich erinnern wir waren zu 16 personen im Bundesheer in einem 60qm Zimmer. Das kann man auf 30 Personen erh #246;hen. Stockbetten wie im BH und ein Spind. WC und Duschen m #252;ssen von den Asylanten selber geputzt werden, war im BH auch so. Es gibt nur mehr Kaltverpflegung, eine Dose Thunfisch und langhaltbares Brot. Das Bundesheer hatte Brot das haltet 6 Monate. Schmeckt aber nicht. Gesundheitsversorgung minimal, beim BH wurden Arztbesuche indirekt bestraft zB durften wir dann am WE nicht raus. Immer die Leute als simulaten hinstellen. erst wenn es dramatisch wird etwas tun. Viele Leute in einem Zimmer verursacht immer Streit und Schl #228;gereien. Am besten Frauen und M #228;nner gemischt, hat mehr Konfliktpotential. Die Leute zerm #252;ben, ein Teil wird aufgeben wieder zur #252;ck oder in ein anderes EU-Land. Es wird sich schnell herumsprechen das  #214;sterreich ganz mies ist. Es werden weniger kommen. Das spricht sich dank Whatsapp und Co schnell herum. Den Asylanten null aussicht geben. Einfach jahre ohne entscheidung in der grundversorgung lassen. weder ja noch nein. das wird sie fertig machen. Aber immer wieder freiwillige R #252;ckf #252;hrung anbieten und gro #223; daf #252;r werben. Ich kann dir die Fl #252;chtlingszahlen innerhalb von 5 Jahre auf weniger als 5000 pro Jahr reduzieren. Ich kann 12.000 freiwillige R #252;ckf #252;hrungen pro Jahr erreichen. Der Sebastian Kurz tut gar nichts, denn wenn er sein Feindbild verliert wof #252;r soll man diese Neoliberale Ratte noch w #228;hlen. Der macht doch Politik f #252;r die Top 5%.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Es ist nicht alles schlecht an Sebastian Kurz. Er ist gestern stolz (zurecht) mit Strache vor die Presse getreten und verk #252;ndete das die Kinderbetreuung in allen Bundesl #228;ndern gesichert ist, er konnte sich durch #173;set #173;zen und K #252;rzungen verhindern. Die Eltern k #246;nnen aufatmen. Als Ort f #252;r die Pressekonzerenz hat man einen Kindergarten in N #214; ausgew #228;hlt und die komplette Presse eingeladen. Sebastian Kurz konnte sich mit vehemenz gegen Sebastian Kurz durchsetzen, der das Kinderbetreuungsbudget um zig Millionen k #252;rzen wollte. Die K #252;rzungen waren seit Monaten diskutiert und gef #252;rchtet. Jetzt kann jeder beruhigt sein und es bleibt alles besser. Ich muss schon sagen, ich f #252;hle mich wohl mit Sebastian Kurz. Er k #252;mmert sich um die Bev #246;lkerung. Selbstverst #228;ndlich muss so ein Erfolg gro #223; vor der Presse gefeiert werden. Vizekanzler, Konzernkanzler und N #246;-Landeschefin treten subject6652 vor der Presse im Kindergarten. Das ist wirklich ein sch #246;ner Abschluss, ein Happy-End, manche Eltern hatten sich bereits gro #223;e Sorgen gemacht. Aber jetzt sind sie Sebastian Kurz dankbar f #252;r den Erfolg. Das ist Wohlf #252;hl-Politik.</TEXT>

Au #223;erdem motiviert die Regierung die Arbeitnehmern 12h Tag zu arbeiten, durch die Abschaffung der Notstandshilfe wird es deutlich attraktiver auch 12h Arbeitstage zu schieben. Es ist ein M #228;rchen der  #214;GB-Kampfzentrale das die Regierung nichts f #252;r Arbeitnehmer tut, k #252;nftig sind Arbeitnehmer deutlich besser gestellt, sie bekommen viel viel mehr als die neue Gutscheine-Mini-Mindestsicherung.

    <TEXT>Femme-nazis ist einfach ein sch #246;ner catchy begriff. es bringt es so sch #246;n auf den punkt. nat #252;rlich ist mir klar das niemand umgebracht werden soll. es sollen auch keine m #228;nner benachteiligt werden, aber frauen sollen bevorteilt werden. also es l #228;uft darauf hinaus das m #228;nner benachteiligt werden. haben sich die gr #252;nen je f #252;r pension ab 65 f #252;r frauen eingestzt. haben sich die gr #252;ninnen f #252;r wehrpflicht f #252;r frauen eingesetzt nein? oder haben sie sich  #252;ber die geringe quote von 0% von frauen im ger #252;stbau beschwert? frauen werden massiv gef #246;rdert,  #252;berall und immer. schau dir das AMS an, es gibt soviele programm die sind nur f #252;r frauen. ihnen wird teilweise die fh ausbildung komplett bis zum beachlor bezahlt. warum soll der medizin aufnahmetest so ge #228;ndert werden das frauen bevorteilt werden? bisher war er so aufgebaut das jenes gefragt wird was als skill f #252;r einen mediziner n #246;tig ist. in vielen stellen steht frauen werden bei gleicher qualifikation bevorzugt. es geht nicht mehr um gleichberechtigung, die gibt es l #228;ngst vollkommen. es geht darum die frauen  #252;berall zu bevorteilen. dagegen bin ich ganz stark. deshalb spreche ich von femme-nazi. eva glawisching und die tirol tante sind definitiv solche. gr #252;ne sollen sich lieber f #252;r die radler einsetzen, es ist ein horror in wien. sie sollen sich um klimaschutz, tierschutz k #252;mmern. jetzt h #246;rst nur mehr frauen, frauen, frauen. das interessante ist das frauen  #252;berhaupt nicht treu sind zu solchen parteien oder anderen frauen im wahlverhalten. die mehrheit der wei #223; #233;n w #228;hlerinnen hat trump gew #228;hlt, nicht hilary (die frauen kandidatin). selbst wei #223;e uni abg #228;ngerinnen haben mehrheitlich trump gew #228;hlt. wenn frauen danach w #228;hlen w #252;rden, w #228;re die gr #252;ninnen nicht aus dem parlament.</TEXT>

There is an effect and we just cant explain it with todays science. doesnt mean it is fake, doesnt mean it is supernatural. we just dont know what is going on, why should it be supernatural? just like in quantum mechanics. something weird is going on, we have no clue why, but we are 100% sure that this pheonema is true.

    <TEXT>very interesting. especially the part of auras. there was a indian guru, people who visited him, even meeting him the first time, reported feeling overwhelming love when being close to him. so alot of people just loved to hang around him, he didnt even give teachings or lectures.  gt;Magic is just science that hasn #8217;t been explained yet :P That is a nice way of putting it. Early civilizations filled the blank in with gods and fantasies. now when we come across something we cant explain we simply ignore it. like in this case or in quantum mechanics. 80 years ago it has been discovered, up until this day we have no explations, we still cant fantom what the hell is going on. so what do we do? we just ignore it. dont ask way, just calculate. why are we having such a problem? we cant fit quantum mechanics in our current model, but we desperately want to. when I learnt about quantum mechanics many years I was shocked. then I thought why isnt everybody shocked? how can big molecules behave like waves? how can a molecule be at many places at one time?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have linked the video of dean radin in a google tech talk in my original posting. I highly recommend watching it if you are intrested and open to the topic. I strongly condem using wikipedia as a source. they are the worst source. they are highly baised. there was a study of political topics in different wikipedias (german, french, english), it was shown that they hold a bais depending on which wikipedia you used. the craziest and strangest things are happing, things that blow your mind and put everything into question, our very foundations of reality. on of those things is the delayed quantum eraser: https://youtu.be/8ORLN_KwAgs?t=259 science has become the new religion, people dont believe in religion they believe in science. when something new comes up that questions your science, you start become defensive and reject it. like telling Christians about evolution theorie. but,...but.. god created man. it simply doesnt go with my concept of reality, so i reject it. PSI is real. if you say that you will be declared demented and a lunatic.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ich finde es witzig das gerade die zwei Partei die am st #228;rksten gegen Migration und Migranten hetzen jetzt gro #223;fl #228;chig Leute herholen wollen. 6000 "Fachkr #228;fte" aus Dritttaaten (hei #223;t Indien, Pakistan und Co) sollen kommen - das ist bereits beschlossen. Darunter fallen ua Koch, Kellner, etc... Jetzt hat Kurz wieder zu dem Thema gesprochen und will Regeln f #252;r die Rot-Wei #223;-Rot Karte lockern um mehr Leute zu holen. Mahrer (WKO-Chef) will Leute aus S #252;dostasien holen (Kambodscha, Vietnam, Thailand etc). Sicher sehr vern #252;ftig an der absoluten Spitze des Wirtschaftsbooms tausende Leute zu holen. In den 60-70er Jahren gab es auch einen Fachkr #228;fte Mangel, da hat man die T #252;rken und Jugos geholt. Die Leute werden kommen und bleiben und dann von den FP #214; W #228;hlern gehasst. Weiters muss man sie als Konkurrenz sehen, umso mehr Leute am Arbeitsmarkt, umso h #246;her der Wettbewerb und umso geringer die L #246;hne. Die FP #214; wird aber sicher mitmachen, wie bereits bei den 6000 Arbeitern. Den wichtig ist einzig die Wirtschaft, wie es den Menschen, den Arbeitern geht ist unwichtig. Es gibt keinen Arbeitskr #228;ftemangel, wenn die Firmen nur 100-200 Euro  #252;ber Schnitt zahlen bekommen sie sofort unz #228;hlige Bewerbungen. Sie wollen aber nur am absoluten Minimum zahlen und willige Leute ohne Familie und Privatleben (60h Woche) finden. Angebot und Nachfrage soll bei Arbeitsrk #228;ften nur gelten wenn es nach unten geht (=billigere Arbeitskr #228;fte), entwickeln sich die L #246;hne nach oben, m #252;ssen sofort wieder Tausende hergekarrt werden. Die L #246;hne d #252;rfen ja nicht  #252;ber die Inflation steigen, also real wachsen. Das w #228;re ganz furchtbar, den die Rekordgewinne k #246;nnten nicht weiter steigen.</TEXT>
