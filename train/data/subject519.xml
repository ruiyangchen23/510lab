    <TEXT>As a current swimmer with 5 years under my belt, I'd say this. Find a kick board, look up ways to hold it and focus on kicking. And don't just kick for a set time, have a certain distance you need to cover in a given time (or interval). Like I will have kick sets that are 5x100 kick @1:50 (this is a faster time, but it is an example). Now you only need to add in ~15 minutes to kick after your warm up. Another focus would be pulling, put in ~20 minutes for pulling, and build up the feel for the pull (make sure you DON'T cross you arm and the mid part of your body, it can cause shoulder problems). And as main sets go, focus on distance pacing, don't EVER go all out to begin, keep a steady pace the first part, build the second part, and finish with a sprint. If you need any good practices, PM me and I can write some, if not, good luck on your race!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'd say more options for battles after the elite four, I always hated that there were limited options for EXP after the elite four. Maybe multiple regions with more sets of gym battles, like what they did in silver/gold. And I think that most legendary's should be obtained through some sort of an easter egg (Like the regi's). All in all the game looks great and I can't wait for beta (I am a programmer so if I see any bugs in beta, I can help out).</TEXT>
