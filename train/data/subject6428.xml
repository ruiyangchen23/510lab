    <TITLE>I'm hoping to testify before Congress on Thursday against SOPA - help me with my testimony?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2011-11-16 16:31:15</DATE>
    <TEXT>**update!** I wasn't able to speak before a committee/body today, [but I did join a team of tech folks lobbying senators, representatives, and their staffs all day today in Washington](https://plus.google.com/113164038788726940319/posts/ab9eFgmovJ1). Much love to [@mpetricone](http://twitter.com/mpetricone), [@mrcjdawson](http://twitter.com/mrcjdawson), [@thinktankhero](http://twitter.com/thinktankhero), [@micahsch](http://twitter.com/micahsch), and [@leahbel](http://twitter.com/leahbel). It was a day full of intimate, frank discussions that put faces  amp; stories (ours) behind why this legislation would be so awful. I told my story, and how in a ProtectIP world it simply couldn't have happened. We all want to stop the bad guys, but doing *this* would obliterate one of the few growing sectors of our economy (one that we're also out-innovating the rest of the world in) and ruin the beautiful meritocracy that is the world wide web. I hope I did you all justice and though I didn't sleep much last night, you all were instrumental in helping craft what I'd say and how I'd say it. Thank you. Our schedule: * Michael Daum, Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA) * Neeta Bidwai, Senator Mark Warner (D-VA) ([I missed the first two because I was doing a livechat with Mashable](http://mashable.com/2011/11/16/alexis-ohanian-live-chat-announce/)) * Rob Seidman, Senator Kelly Ayotte (R-NH) * Jack Smedile, Senator Roy Blunt (R-MO) * Josh Finestone, Senator Dean Heller (R-NV) * Mark Colwell, Senator Jerry Moran (R-KS) * Congressman Jason Chaffettz (R-UT) And here's a great bit of progress that came out this evening: Senator Morin, who we met today, came out with a statement against Protect IP, saying he (and Rand Paul [R]  amp; Maria Cantwell [D]) will put a hold on it. Now we've got solid bipartisan concerns voiced in both houses of Congress. But there's still lots more work to be done! http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20111117/15492016808/senators-rand-paul-jerry-moran-maria-cantwell-all-warn-that-protect-ip-will-kill-jobs.shtml The major two points I'm hitting are (1) how *awful* it is for the tech industry (e.g., my own entrepreneurial story of reddit wouldn't have happened), which continues to be one of the few strong parts of our economy and [~~(2) it's censorship~~](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/meg8w/im_hoping_to_testify_before_congress_on_thursday/c308qy0) (leaving this argument to my cohorts who are actually experts and not just angry people like me). I'll use as little humor as possible and will be wearing a suit, basically trying to come close to this [awesomeness from Mike Rowe](http://dsc.discovery.com/fansites/dirtyjobs/mike-rowe-senate-testimony.html). Suggestions? edit: Thank you for all the feedback  amp; encouragement! ~~Aw hell, a few of you suggested I create a public google doc -- here it is!~~ (Shut it down because we can't have nice things.)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Help us crowdsource data on town hall meetings offices don't want to publish!</TITLE>
    <DATE>2012-01-06 19:33:10</DATE>
    <TEXT>**The folks at [PCCC](http://act.boldprogressives.org/survey/survey_sopa_reddit/?source=bp) have coordinated all this:** Town halls are the easiest way to talk directly to your legislator in the next week and a half. Legislators will to be in their districts, fielding questions at town hall meetings, leading up to the January 24th vote on PIPA. The events are already scheduled, but many offices are making it hard to get the information about when they will occur. They're scared that big crowds might create overwhelming media coverage, pushing back on a bill that has already been bought and paid for by Hollywood. We need your help to crowdsource the data! Can you call your legislator's local district office and ask when the town hall is happening in your area? (Don't call their office in DC -- they probably won't have the info!) Directions for what info we need, and how to find it, available here: http://pccc.me/zYSLJr The results are automatically posted here: http://pccc.me/A60I9s We'll send out some talking points in the next few days -- you'll be able to ask questions directly to your legislator, and hopefully help them understand why SOPA and PIPA are bad bills.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2012-06-22 16:01:20</DATE>
    <TEXT>I founded a site called reddit back in 2005 with Steve ["spez"](http://reddit.com/user/spez) Huffman, which I have the pleasure of serving on the board. After we were acquired, I started a social enterprise called [breadpig](http://breadpig.com) to publish books and geeky things in order to donate the profits to worthy causes ($200K so far!). After [3 months volunteering in Armenia as a kiva fellow](http://fellowsblog.kiva.org/2010/03/03/ararat-me-one-armenians-return-to-the-homeland/) I helped Steve and our friend Adam launch a travel search website called [hipmunk](http://hipmunk.com) where I ran marketing/pr/community-stuff for a year and change before [SOPA/PIPA became my life](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR6EbdH_0qQ). I've taken all these lessons and put them into a class I've been teaching around the world called ["Make Something People Love"](http://generalassemb.ly/start/fundamentals-of-entrepreneurship/making-something-people-love) and *as of today* it's an [e-book published by Hyperink](http://www.hyperink.com/Make-Something-People-Love-Lessons-From-A-Startup-Guy-b1478). The e-book and video scale a lot better than I do. These days, I'm helping [continue the fight for the open internet](http://upworthy.com/the-battle-for-internet-freedom-has-just-begun-and-youre-the-superhero-to-save-i?c=oha), spoiling my cat, and generally help make the world suck less. Oh, and working hard on [that book I've gotta submit in November](http://withoutyourpermission.com). You have no idea how much this site means to me and I will forever be grateful for what it has done (and continues to do) for me. Thank you. Oh, and AMA.</TEXT>

Maybe you saw it, but in case you didn #8217;t  #8230; well, now you know.  gt; Here are the fan club  #8220;rules #8221;:  gt; * We won #8217;t spam you; we #8217;ll probably send 1 email per week on average  gt; * If you #8217;d rather not get emails like this, just reply and say so, and we won #8217;t bother you any more  gt; * On the other hand, if anything we send seems noteworthy, feel free to forward/share/tweet/+1/whatever about it to your own friends and associates.

    <TITLE>Iam John Ohanian 92 year old lawyer, part-time working lawyer for people to get social security disability benefits and Alexis Ohanian's (reddit cofounder) grandfather.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2014-06-24 23:33:04</DATE>
    <TEXT>*Alexis here: I'm typing this for my grandpa who's dictating to me. He's one of my heroes and I think you'll see why (and how fortunate I am to be here). Everything not in italics in this AMA are his words.* [Proof.](https://twitter.com/alexisohanian/status/481550518599553026) **UPDATE: 2 hours in and my grandpa is done interviewing for today. Keep asking and I promise I'll ask him over the phone and reply later this week or next. Thanks, everyone! Grandpa is officially a redditor.** The families of my parents were orphaned when the Turkish government cleansed the Armenian population in central Turkey during the Armenian genocide. My mother was one of the refugees that marched out -- many died including her brother and sister -- through Turkey to Aleppo, Syria. My father's parents were murdered, in his presence, when the Turks stormed his town. A soldier on horseback was about to kill him with a sword when his friend told him to stop, because he was too young, and as only child, my father was then taken to an orphanage in Turkey and left there. He first came to the US around 1920 and later he found that my mother was living in Aleppo -- they had been next-door neighbors and he brought her to the United States and they married soon thereafter. They had 4 children, 3 girls and a boy. I had one older sister and two younger sisters. I was the second child. If I learned anything from my parents, it was to take care of yourself and your own needs and your family needs and that the family was the most important part of growing up. I was born on Jan 12, 1922 in Binghamton NY. I left when I was about 17 or 18 for one year at the College of William and Mary. WWII started, so a group of us volunteered -- about a dozen -- and joined the US Army. I spent 33 months in the Army after my first year of college and was discharged (came in as a private and left as an air cadet just months away from a second lieutenant as a flight engineer on a B-29). I was scheduled to go to Okinawa (I believe) when President Truman gave the order to bomb Hiroshima + Nagasaki. When that happened, I was told I'd be discharged and went back to W amp;M to finish my undergraduate and then took three years of law school there. Around 1951 I got a job with the Federal Trade Commission in Washington DC as an attorney. When we were hired we were told only 1/3 would be kept after about the 9th or 10th month and would fire 2/3 of the 100 lawyers hired by the end. I spent 21 years with the FTC initially doing investigation and later trial work. I left in 1972, I believe, and came to LA to live and got a job with Social Security as an administrative law judge, whose function was primarily to hear cases for applications of disability benefits. I worked as a judge in West LA for a year and subsequently for 9 years in Long Beach. After a decade as a Social Security law judge I opened my own practice in downtown LA at where I represented people who claimed disability under social security. I've now been working out of my home in private practice since 1982. @@@ I might mention that my older sister, Vera, was a school teacher for many years. Starting in the lower grades and moving to NYC where she was a professor at a college that trained people to be teachers. My second oldest sister, Elsa, was a dental hygienist for many years, and my youngest sister, Mary, was a psychologist who counseled drug addicts in NY -- she died early due to cancer. All family members try to help each other. My older sister loaned me money when I needed it to buy a house and get started in life and I paid her back.</TEXT>

If somehow two of you end up guessing the right number, I'll award the tickets to whomever posted *first* I know there were a bunch of very generous other fans offering up free tickets but I got a bit sidetracked and wanted to just make sure I lived up to my promise.

    <TITLE>Semi-related: Really awesome statement from Tor</TITLE>
    <DATE>2014-12-13 18:28:49</DATE>
    <TEXT>https://blog.torproject.org/blog/solidarity-against-online-harassment As a cofounder of reddit, two sections in particular really resonated with me. "We work on anonymity technology because we believe in empowering people. This empowerment is the beginning and a means, not the end of the discussion. Each person who has power to speak freely on the net also has the power to hurt and harm. Merely because one is free to say a thing does not mean that it should be tolerated or considered reasonable." (replace 'anonymity' with 'pseudonymity' and you've got reddit) and "Similarly, in the offline world, we support freedom of speech but we oppose the abuse and harassment of women and others. We know that online harassment is one small piece of the larger struggle that women, people of color, and others face against sexism, racism, homophobia and other bigotry." Granted, afaik this does not come with any specific actions or plans for action, but I really liked the tone and content. Thoughts?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey redditors. We're working with WIRED Magazine on a new web show called Cyborg Nation, and we're looking for some of the most imaginative and cutting edge devices and technologies that people are using and inventing to enhance human capabilities and solve disabilities. It's commonplace to track our movements on fitness bands, monitor our sleep patterns with cell phones, and interact with our homes on smart watches, but how far will it go? Will our grandkids think nothing of onlining their nervous systems? Will disability be a thing of the past? The show will look at the ground breaking technology of today, and contemplate a realistic future that is truly "post-human." Got a good idea for a subject or technology that we don't know about?</TEXT>

Nearly all of that has come from intrepid individuals who create and moderate this vast network of communities. I know, because I was reddit #8217;s first "community manager" back when we had just one (/r/reddit.com) but you all have far outgrown those humble beginnings. In creating hundreds of thousands of communities over this decade, you #8217;ve learned a lot along the way, and we have, too; we #8217;re rolling out improvements to help you create the next 9,000 active communities and beyond! **Check Out the First Mod Tutorial Today!** [We #8217;ve started a series of mod tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THHl3VT4vms), which will help anyone from experienced moderators to total neophytes learn how to most effectively use our tools (which we #8217;re always improving) to moderate and grow the best community they can. Moderators can feel overwhelmed by the tasks involved in setting up and building a community. These tutorials should help reduce that learning curve, letting mods learn from those who have been there and done that. **New Team  amp; New Hires** Jessica (/u/5days) has stepped up to lead the community team for all of reddit after managing the redditgifts community for 5 years. Lesley (/u/weffey) is coming over to build better tools to support our community managers who help all of our volunteer reddit moderators create great communities on reddit. We #8217;re working through new policies to help you all create the most open and wide-reaching platform we can. We #8217;re especially excited about building more mod tools to let software do the hard stuff when it comes to moderating your particular community. We #8217;re striving to build the robots that will give you more time to spend engaging with your community -- [spend more time discussing the virtues of cooking with spam](http://redd.it/2mc9tt), not dealing with spam in your subreddit. **Protecting Your Digital Privacy** Last year, we missed a chance to be a leader in social media when it comes to protecting your privacy -- something we #8217;ve cared deeply about since reddit #8217;s inception. At our recent all hands company meeting, this was something that we all, as a company, decided we needed to address. No matter who you are, if a photograph, video, or digital image of you in a state of nudity, sexual excitement, or engaged in any act of sexual conduct, is posted or linked to on reddit without your permission, it is prohibited on reddit. We also recognize that violent personalized images are a form of harassment that we do not tolerate and we will remove them when notified. [As usual, the revised Privacy Policy will go into effect in two weeks, on March 10, 2015](https://www.reddit.com/help/privacypolicy#section_involuntary_pornography). [We #8217;re so proud to be leading the way among our peers when it comes to your digital privacy and consider this to be one more step in the right direction.](http://redd.it/2sk8i9) We #8217;ll share how often these takedowns occur in our yearly privacy report. We made reddit to be the world #8217;s best platform for communities to be informed about whatever interests them. We #8217;re learning together as we go, and today #8217;s changes are going to help grow reddit for the next ten years and beyond. We #8217;re so grateful and excited to have you join us on this journey. -- Jessica, Ellen, Alexis  amp; the rest of team reddit</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Hi r/Entrepreneur, we're introducing 'Formative' by Reddit + Google</TITLE>
    <DATE>2015-10-14 17:06:47</DATE>
    <TEXT>**[You can watch the video announcement teaser here!](https://youtu.be/k3-_6g0kxrk )** Hi r/Entrepreneur! We #8217;re excited to announce a unique collaboration between the r/Entrepreneur community, Reddit and Google Cloud Platform. We #8217;re working with Google on a new video series called FORMATIVE, and we #8217;d love to work together with the community at r/Entrepreneur to develop this series. FORMATIVE aims to explore one defining moment in a person #8217;s life. We #8217;ll sit down with eight creators utilizing technology: travel back in time to when that moment occurred, hear about the circumstances surrounding it in their own words, then return to present day and see how it has influenced their lives. Redditors will have a direct impact on how the series is produced; if you had ten minutes with any audacious creators and builders in the technology space, who would it be and what would you ask them? **Let us know who you #8217;d like to see featured in each episode, and we #8217;ll do our best to make it happen!** -- u/subject6428 **edit: Today, Oct 20th, is the last day for votes  amp; submissions!!!**</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A month and a half ago, we launched [Upvoted](https://upvoted.com/). The idea, as [ownage561 wisely predicted](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3lv3qo/marty_weiner_reddit_cto_back_to_cto_all_the_things/cv9jwm8?ref=upvoted amp;ref_source=content amp;ref_campaign=Perspectives), was [to create launch a hub to give the stories of Reddit #8212;from the seemingly ordinary to the extraordinary #8212;the creative space to expand, breathe, and grow.](https://upvoted.com/2015/10/06/a-redditorial-publication/) We #8217;ve learned a lot so far, [made some good progress](http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/upvoted.com), and thought it #8217;d be fun to do a brief month-in-review so you can see what articles performed the best. Here is a list of the top two articles for each week #8212;it #8217;s a good reflection of the diversity of content and communities on Reddit. **10/6-10/10** * [How Three Survivors of Suicide Spent Their Last Days On Earth](https://upvoted.com/2015/10/03/survivors-of-suicide-spent-their-last-days-on-earth/) * [Redditor Uses Hyperlink Trickery to Meet Taylor Swift](https://upvoted.com/2015/10/09/taylor-swift-radio-contest-reddit-trick/) **10/11-10/17** * [Watch Adam Savage Test the Ultimate Duck Army Bomb](https://upvoted.com/2015/10/15/exclusive-watch-adam-savage-test-the-ultimate-duck-army-bomb/) * [Why I Post My Nude Photos Online](https://upvoted.com/2015/10/08/why-i-post-my-nude-photos-online/) **10/18-10/24** * [Martin Shkreli, Controversial Turing Pharmaceuticals CEO, Answers Reddit Users #8217; Questions in AMA](https://upvoted.com/2015/10/24/martin-shkreli-controversial-turing-pharmaceuticals-ceo-answers-reddit-users-questions-in-ama/) * [The Less Obvious Perks of Being a Guy at a Taylor Swift Concert](https://upvoted.com/2015/10/19/the-less-obvious-perks-of-being-a-guy-at-a-taylor-swift-concert/) **10/25-10/31** * [The Creepiest Gifs and Videos on the Internet](https://upvoted.com/2015/10/27/the-creepiest-gifs-on-the-internet-that-you-should-never-ever-watch/) * [Pineberries Are White Strawberries That Taste Like Pineapples](https://upvoted.com/2015/10/26/pineberries-are-white-strawberries-that-taste-like-pineapples/) **11/1-11/7** * [UPDATE: Note Asking for Help in Shoebox Turns Out to be a Hoax; Company Brings in Translators](https://upvoted.com/2015/11/06/help-us-worker-finds-disturbing-note-in-an-unopened-shoebox-at-store/) * [Why Don #8217;t Humans Have Penis Bones?](https://upvoted.com/2015/10/29/why-dont-humans-have-penis-bones/) **11/8-11/14** * [A Mosaic of Donald Trump Made With 500 Dick Pics](https://upvoted.com/2015/11/13/a-mosaic-of-donald-trump-made-with-500-dick-pics/) * [LIVE FEED: Shooting and Explosion in Paris](https://upvoted.com/2015/11/13/breaking-shooting-and-explosion-in-paris/) The [Upvoted](https://upvoted.com/) team and I would like to thank you for such a successful first month.

    <TITLE>An Open Letter to the Reddit Community</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-01-30 23:34:49</DATE>
    <TEXT>After two weeks abroad, I was looking forward to returning to the U.S. this weekend, but as I got off the plane at LAX on Sunday, I wasn't sure what country I was coming back to. President Trump #8217;s recent executive order is not only potentially unconstitutional, but deeply un-American. We are a nation of immigrants, after all. In the tech world, we often talk about a startup #8217;s  #8220;unfair advantage #8221; that allows it to beat competitors. Welcoming immigrants and refugees has been our country's unfair advantage, and coming from an immigrant family has been mine as an entrepreneur. As many of you know, I am the son of an undocumented immigrant from Germany and the great grandson of refugees who fled the Armenian Genocide. A little over a century ago, a Turkish soldier decided my great grandfather was too young to kill after cutting down his parents in front of him; instead of turning the sword on the boy, the soldier sent him to an orphanage. Many Armenians, including my great grandmother, found sanctuary in Aleppo, Syria #8212;before the two reconnected and found their way to Ellis Island. Thankfully they weren't retained, rather they found this message: * #8220;Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, the wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed to me, I lift my lamp beside the golden door! #8221;* My great grandfather didn #8217;t speak much English, but he worked hard, and was able to get a job at Endicott-Johnson Shoe Company in Binghamton, NY. That was his family's golden door. And though he and my great grandmother had four children, all born in the U.S., immigration continued to reshape their family, generation after generation. The one son they had #8212;my grandfather [(here #8217;s his AMA)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/29039l/iam_john_ohanian_92_year_old_lawyer_parttime/) #8212;volunteered to serve in the Second World War and married a French-Armenian immigrant. And my mother, a native of Hamburg, Germany, decided to leave her friends, family, and education behind after falling in love with my father, who was born in San Francisco. She got a student visa, came to the U.S. and then worked as an au pair, uprooting her entire life for love in a foreign land. She overstayed her visa. She should have left, but she didn't. After she and my father married, she received a green card, which she kept for over a decade until she became a citizen. I grew up speaking German, but she insisted I focus on my English in order to be successful. She eventually got her citizenship and I #8217;ll never forget her swearing in ceremony. If you #8217;ve never seen people taking the pledge of allegiance for the first time as U.S. Citizens, it will move you: a room full of people who can really appreciate what I was lucky enough to grow up with, simply by being born in Brooklyn. It thrills me to write reference letters for enterprising founders who are looking to get visas to start their companies here, to create value and jobs for these United States. My forebears were brave refugees who found a home in this country. I #8217;ve always been proud to live in a country that said yes to these shell-shocked immigrants from a strange land, that created a path for a woman who wanted only to work hard and start a family here. Without them, there #8217;s no me, and there #8217;s no Reddit. We are Americans. Let #8217;s not forget that we #8217;ve thrived as a nation because we #8217;ve been a beacon for the courageous #8212;the tired, the poor, the tempest-tossed. Right now, Lady Liberty #8217;s lamp is dimming, which is why it's more important than ever that we speak out and show up to support all those for whom it shines #8212;past, present, and future. I ask you to do this however you see fit, whether it's calling your representative (this works, it's how we defeated SOPA + PIPA), marching in protest, [donating to the ACLU](https://action.aclu.org/secure/donate-to-aclu), or voting, of course, and not just for Presidential elections. Our platform, like our country, thrives the more people and communities we have within it. Reddit, Inc. will continue to welcome all citizens of the world to our digital community and our office.  #8212;Alexis **And for all of you American redditors who are immigrants, children of immigrants, or children #8217;s children of immigrants, we invite you to share your family #8217;s story in the comments.**</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;ve been lucky enough to have met more redditors face-to-face than anyone. Over the last twelve years, I #8217;ve crisscrossed the USA and traveled the world meeting redditors from Birmingham to Bangalore. The one thing they all have in common is why they love Reddit--because it #8217;s either helped them feel heard, or showed them they weren #8217;t alone. These are the stories I reference daily when I #8217;m introducing people to Reddit: executives, reporters, and [random people on the street who ask about my hat.](https://www.reddit.com/r/olympics/comments/4wllsl/reddit_at_the_games/) Six years ago, after finishing a talk, I met a young woman with cerebral palsy who told me Reddit was the one place where she didn #8217;t feel judged by anything other than her ideas. Here, she #8217;s just another username--that #8217;s all we know about her. People who may not feel comfortable getting on a stage in front of 50 people now can have an audience of millions based purely on how much people like what they have to say.  #8220;Reddit has given me a voice, #8221; she told me. Four years ago, in town for a Reddit all hands, I met a woman who told me that Reddit had saved her life. The community that did it was r/cripplingalcoholism and she found it at a point in her life when everyone in her offline community and her family had abandoned her, except these redditors. They rescued her, she said, and she #8217;s been grateful ever since. I #8217;ve met people who #8217;ve fallen in love on Reddit; I met one person in the midwest who got his pilot #8217;s license thanks to the r/flying community (he couldn #8217;t believe commercial pilots would answer his  #8216;dumb rookie questions #8217; on Reddit); there was another who told me about the time his cat hit #1 on r/aww--that #8217;s the whole story, he was just really proud. I #8217;ve met people whose lives have been so impacted by the Reddit community, they #8217;ve gotten a Snoo tattoo. I #8217;ve even seen one [Mr. Splashy Pants tattoo.](https://www.ted.com/talks/alexis_ohanian_how_to_make_a_splash_in_social_media) These stories help people realize what we on Reddit take for granted: that pseudonymous connections on Reddit can be just as important as the connections we make with people we see every day offline. This isn #8217;t about creating FOMO; it #8217;s about starting authentic conversations. We want everyone to have a home on Reddit. That starts by empowering everyone to find their voice here A few weeks ago, I wrote an open letter to all of you, in which I shared the story of how my family came to this country. What really struck me about that post wasn't the fact that people upvoted it or said they agreed with what I said. It was how many of you responded by sharing your own immigration stories in the comments. This single post became an anthology with thousands of stories from people with totally different backgrounds. I hope that today is another positive step in helping these conversations thrive on our site. **So, in that spirit, I'd like to pose another question to all of you: How has the community at Reddit made your life better?**</TEXT>

We started working on our original company, My Mobile Menu (MMM!) not long after I got back to the States that summer of our third year at UVA. That's "the pitch" I'm referring to below. Reddit came later. That's another post...  gt; hey bro,  gt; i #8217;m in singapore at this technepreneurial seminar, and am basically spending a week learning how to create a tech start-up.i spoke to Mark White (a professor in the comm school, the guy who took me to South Africa, and who recruited me to come here, as well as a generally good guy and technophile) over some drinks last nite, and pitched him on our idea #8230;from his feedback #8211;and let me remind you that he gets pitches every couple of months from students, and was very candid and honest with his thoughts, but basically said it was one of the best he #8217;s heard, period.  gt; Not only that, but he wants to be on the board of directors, and already knows some people to hit up for starting capital #8230;  gt; I #8217;ve got plenty of more details, but I am seriously considering putting off law school for this, but i need you, and we #8217;ll both need to be doing this full time for about a year to get it off the ground #8230;.but the potential he saw was in the millions my friend #8230;we need to talkseriously.i am coming back the 20th so if we could have lunch around 1pm i could meet you whereever you #8217;d like #8230; let me know.  gt; honestly, this is the kind of thing that could change our lives #8211;and his motivation has really spurred me.but i need you and the same kind of commitment.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>How I met Steve or: How I made a seemingly insignificant decisions that drastically altered the course of my life</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-03-31 20:39:46</DATE>
    <TEXT>I applied to only one college, the University of Virginia. At the time I didn #8217;t give it much thought, but I can #8217;t help wondering how much different life would #8217;ve been if I hadn #8217;t made that seemingly insignificant decision. I had no contingency plan aside from the local community college, much to my parents #8217; dismay. I included along with my application a CD-R with my  #8220;digital portfolio #8221; on it. It #8217;s rather embarrassing, but I #8217;ve now uploaded it for your viewing pleasure. I #8217;ll wait while you go look. If you were drinking a cup of coffee at the time, I imagine you did a spit-take. If not, please don #8217;t tell me, as I #8217;d like to preserve the image. Much to my parents #8217; relief, I got in to UVA. But that #8217;s not the important part. The decision that defined my experience there and made reddit possible was checking the box for  #8220;old dorms #8221; on the housing questionnaire. I didn #8217;t know what this meant at the time; old dorms just sounded cooler than new dorms, which were really suites #8212;I wanted something that looked like the colleges I #8217;d seen in movies. The day we moved in, I spotted a blond-haired guy playing Gran Turismo on his PlayStation 2 across the hall from my new dorm room. His name was Steve Huffman. I was thrilled because I #8217;d worried that no one played video games in college #8212;that this was something I #8217;d have to leave behind as a relic of my childhood. Steve was much less excited to meet me, because he #8217;d seen my name on the door and thought he was living on a co-ed hall. So I was excited that he played video games; he was bummed that I wasn #8217;t a girl. He got over that, and we became best friends. Picking old dorms and ending up across the hall from Steve was one of the best, albeit most random, things that ever happened to me. *[(Excerpted from my book, Without Their Permission)](http://ohanian.co/wtpbook)* **I want to hear from you: What seemingly unimportant decision have you made that drastically changed your life?**</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I had a really formative first job (the secret to my public speaking) -- what was yours?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-04-03 07:33:29</DATE>
    <TEXT>A company called [Sidea](http://web.archive.org/web/19970710051447/http://www.sidea.com/) was my first nonfamilial employer (I suspect the real reason my dad wanted a kid was that he needed someone to do all his yard work #8212;and for well below minimum wage, I might add). I later worked a lot of random jobs between high school and college: Pizza Hut cook and waiter (some of the best customer-service experience one can get), deli counter attendant (I was terrible at this and hated smelling like cold cuts after work, despite how much my dog liked it), FedEx warehouse grunt (great exercise, though not very mentally stimulating), and parking booth attendant (get paid to read books? Yes, please! Until the robots replace humans, that is). But the job with Sidea was one of the most pivotal I ever had #8211;even if the company went bankrupt a year after I started (not my fault!), a victim of the dot-com bubble bursting. A guy named Carlos Cerqueira interviewed me after a friend's intro and hired me on the spot. My job was simple: I had to man a booth in the middle of a CompUSA store, armed with a headset microphone and a large computer monitor. I was to demo software and hardware every thirty minutes #8212;regardless of whether or not anyone was listening. Want to give a fourteen-year-old experience in public speaking? Tell him he has to demo random computer products to an entire CompUSA full of people ignoring him. I can #8217;t tell you how many demos I gave to no one. But I did every one of them as though my boss were watching. In between demos, I killed time browsing the Internet for the latest in Quake II news. For this job I was paid a ludicrous ten dollars per hour. I think I know why Sidea went bust. But damn if that wasn #8217;t a fabulous way for me to start public speaking. If you #8217;ve experienced the embarrassment of the public speaker #8217;s worst-case scenario (speaking to a roomful of people who are both ignoring you and hating you) before you #8217;ve finished puberty, things are probably going to be okay. One day I was approached by a man trying to decide between two different mice. I don #8217;t recall the details, but there wasn #8217;t a big difference between them, save the color and maybe another minor feature. I pitched him on his two options with a quip about the bonus  #8220;feature #8221; of a different color. He laughed and offered me a job. He handed me his card and said he #8217;d like to hire me for sales. I kept that card in my wallet for years until it finally disintegrated. Fortunately, I scanned it before it did. "Steve Harper, General Sales Manager of Stanley Foods" I didn #8217;t have the heart to tell the man I was only fourteen. When I told my parents about the offer, they told me to finish high school first. I never called Steve Harper, but I had a hunch I was on the right track. Thank you Carlos  amp; Steve. You have no idea how much you did for me.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Never Turn Down Cannoli (The story of the pastry that led to Reddit getting acquired by Conde Nast)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-04-06 00:13:51</DATE>
    <TEXT>In between bites of cannolo (yep, that #8217;s the singular form of cannoli), I was explaining to Rachel Metz, freelance reporter for Wired, why reddit.com was going to become the front page of the Internet. She seemed interested, but she could #8217;ve just been enjoying her cannolo. I #8217;d taken the Fung Wah bus down from Boston to meet with her in downtown Manhattan because a few weeks earlier, I #8217;d met a friend of hers named Jennifer 8. Lee. Jenny had attended a Halloween party that Steve and I had thrown at our Somerville home/office and we hit it off. We discussed the subject of [her book](https://www.amazon.com/Fortune-Cookie-Chronicles-Adventures-Chinese/dp/0446698970/ref=sr_1_1?s=books amp;ie=UTF8 amp;qid=1491430412 amp;sr=1-1 amp;keywords=fortune+cookie+chronicles) proposal, which happened to be, of all things, Chinese food. I managed to impress Jenny with my knowledge of Chinese cuisine, so we got to talking that night and that led to her introduction to Rachel. A few days later, Rachel would confess to me that while she initially wanted to write a story about reddit, she felt we #8217;d become friends and that it wouldn #8217;t be professional for her to pursue the story. That was fine by me. No Wired story came from that, but I got a new friend in Rachel, one who happened to mention reddit to her editor at Wired, Kristen Philipkoski. Kristen, the wife of Kourosh Karimkhany, was doing business development for Conde Nast and heard from Rachel about a pair of plucky founders in Boston working on something interesting called reddit. And then one day (February 22, 2006, to be precise) this e-mail popped up in my inbox:  gt; I #8217;m a friend of Rachel Metz. I #8217;m also the director of biz dev for Cond #233;Net, the internet arm of Cond #233; Nast, which, as I #8217;m sure you know, publishes magazines like Wired, GQ, Vogue, New Yorker, Vanity Fair, etc. I #8217;m intrigued with your technology and was hoping to set up a time to talk about possibly working together. I #8217;m open the rest of the day today and Thursday, but will be traveling for a week starting Friday. Do you have time for a phone call? Also, are you based in Boston? Little did we know that exactly one year after that fateful party on Halloween, Steve and I would be celebrating the acquisition of our company. As if you needed more reasons to throw a Halloween party. Or eat cannoli.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's simply not true.  gt; "Lazarus drew inspiration from her Sephardic Jewish heritage and from her work on Ward's Island, where she helped Jewish refugees who had been detained by immigration authorities." [Source: National Park Service](https://www.nps.gov/stli/learn/historyculture/emma-lazarus.htm) If that's not enough, here's the full poem. The italicized parts (mine) really make it pretty clear it's about Lady Liberty being a welcome to the world's poor, tried, huddled + unfree masses. You should visit! The museum at Ellis Island is amazing and you can get a great view of the Statue for free on the Staten Island Ferry. **The New Colossus** Not like the brazen giant of Greek fame, With conquering limbs astride from land to land; *Here at our sea-washed, sunset gates shall stand* *A mighty woman with a torch, whose flame* *Is the imprisoned lightning, and her name* *Mother of Exiles. From her beacon-hand* *Glows world-wide welcome;* her mild eyes command The air-bridged harbor that twin cities frame. "Keep ancient lands, your storied pomp!" cries she With silent lips. "Give me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, The wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me, I lift my lamp beside the golden door!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>How a Waffle House changed my life</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-05-09 22:36:44</DATE>
    <TEXT>Steve and I spent most of our free time together in college playing video games or pranks on one another (I ended up on the receiving end most of the time). I #8217;d had ambitions to study computer science because of how much I enjoyed it during high school, but that all changed once I met people like Steve and realized I #8217;d better nurture my computer talents as a hobby only. Instead, I became a history major and told myself I was going to study law and become an immigration lawyer. I suddenly became an overachiever who cared too much about his GPA because I knew, as an out-of-state student, that my parents wouldn #8217;t have been able to afford UVA if it weren #8217;t for a generous gift from my great-aunt Vera (great and great, for which I #8217;m endlessly grateful). She made sure I never had to take out a student loan, and for that reason I wanted to get the most out of my four years #8212;that #8217;s why I majored in history and business (graduating with high honors) and minored in German. By my junior year, however, I realized I didn #8217;t want to be a lawyer. This epiphany came while I was with my friend Jack Thorman at a Waffle House, which I highly recommend for both the epiphanies and the waffles. Steve had already gotten a job offer from a small software company in Virginia. I myself had waffled (puns!) about becoming an immigration lawyer until I #8217;d realized that Saturday mornings are better spent enjoying breakfast. At that point I abruptly walked out of the Kaplan LSAT prep course I was taking. Something happened in between those syrupy bites; I needed to know why I had wanted to spend three very expensive years getting a piece of paper that would make me a lawyer. In truth, I didn #8217;t know. Steve and I had had far too many great brainstorming sessions over beer and pizza for me to give up on turning one of those ideas into a reality. Thank you, Waffle House, because you led me to become an entrepreneur (and not a lawyer!).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Had a great time. Never been in the snakepit before and everyone was so nice. It was remarkable. Loved hearing Fade to Black live. The 4 giant drums part was a bit weird, but they took a chance, I'll allow it. You could tell it was a first show on the US tour because of some minor tech difficulties and a bit of rust, but James' voice sounds great and Moth into the Flame and Hardwired really delivered live. I'll download my snapstory when I land and share with you here.

    <TEXT>I'm so happy you met with Justin + Michael at YC. They're really smart investors (and founders). And I love that you all have a reddit community already. You're definitely going to catch some early friction (not fair, but fact) because Juicero has been such a spectacular failure, so be preapred for that. [The distribution model is clever](http://www.juicebot.com/#distribution) and I have a hunch LA will be a strong market for you. Personally, I'm a smoothie guy because I love/need all the fiber. You all have some great hustle; that kind of relentless resourcefulness is exactly what Y Combinator looks for and [I hope you'll apply.](https://www.ycombinator.com/apply/)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If you've built something that people want. In most cases you'll have enough traction organically that you won't need to find capital for growth. Product market fit shouldn't come from spending money, it comes from writing code + talking to users. Once you've got that, which in nearly all cases you can do for little cost, I'd do what we did and apply to accelerators (YC would obviously be my top choice). Steve and I were two nobodies coming out of UVA when we got into YC back in 2005. The $12K they gave us in funding was more money than I'd had my entire life (even working through highschool + parttime in college) and it was enough to get us to something good enough on Demo Day to raise more. Otherwise, you can dig into pitching angels and can also list on AngelList, but it has a bit of a negative signal.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sounds like you're working on something that can have a really great and important impact. I'd spend some time on the addiction communities on Reddit to see how they're working so well to help people using accountability and community to succeed where many other things have failed. https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/ is one of the biggest, but they exist for just about every addiction imaginable. Learn from what's working there (and maybe what isn't) in order to build something successful, you're going to have to at least be a material improvement. Keep writing code, keep talking to users. All the best!</TEXT>

I asked a room full of a few hundred people at SXSW if they knew who "Hector Janse van Rensburg" was -- 2 hands went up -- and then who knew "u/Shitty_watercolour" and almost every hand went up. The rest of the world doesn't realize it yet, but Reddit does: pseudonymous identity can matters as much or more than your government name.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Nice pitch. Curious pitch environment, but I scoped out http://www.brotherscoffee.co/ I'm actually an investor in craftcoffee, so I can tell you that this is going to be a feat to really get to scale. But that's OK! Just know that something like YC is designed to invest in companies that have high-growth, multi-billion dollar potential. You really want to be able to optimize for growth -- obsess over the funnel on your website. The conversion rates for someone landing on your home page need to be super high, or else you'll be putting all that money (think of it like water) into a funnel full of holes (very little of the water/paid-traffic actually converts). A few google searches and time on relevant reddit communities will teach you a lot about that optimization. Good luck! The world could use more companies doing well by doing good.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>How Reddit Went from Mobile-Food-Ordering Service to Front Page of the Internet</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-06-05 20:48:05</DATE>
    <TEXT>**Here's an excerpt from my book, [Without Their Permission](https://www.amazon.com/Without-Their-Permission-Reddit-Blueprint/dp/1455520012/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8 amp;qid= amp;sr=)** [Once that Waffle House changed my life](https://www.reddit.com/user/subject6428/comments/6a83fz/how_a_waffle_house_changed_my_life/) and realized I didn't want to be a lawyer, inventing a career for myself became the obvious path. Steve and I had an idea to let people skip waiting in line to order food by ordering from their phone, and I began talking to local restaurateurs about their point-of-sale systems and experiences using online ordering, which back then was basically a glorified fax service. I was learning a lot, and all indications were that we #8217;d stay in Charlottesville after we graduated to build our company: My Mobile Menu (MMM!). It was 2005. The "smartest" phone on the market was a Palm Treo. Our lives changed with a fateful trip to Cambridge that spring of our senior year. One of Steve #8217;s idols, Paul Graham, announced he #8217;d be speaking at Harvard, and Steve #8217;s girlfriend suggested he go. When he sent me the link, I responded with gusto (despite not really knowing who Graham was) because I #8217;d never been to Boston and the theme sounded perfect for us: "How to Start a Startup." Granted, it was during our spring break, but it #8217;s not like we were going to the beach anyway. The sun makes using a laptop nearly impossible, the screen glare is terrible, and besides, there #8217;s all that sand. Graham had started a company called Viaweb #8212;the first online store #8212;during the first dot-com bubble. He sold it for fifty million dollars to Yahoo!, which gave him the financial security to focus on his art and publish essays online about all things having to do with startups and programming. By the early aughts, he #8217;d become a pundit in the tech community with a significant following of programmers, including Steve. I didn #8217;t expect there to be so much snow. We #8217;d taken an agonizingly long train ride up from Virginia, spent our first night at a friend #8217;s apartment, and prepared for the talk. Actually, Steve leveled up his priest in World of Warcraft. But then we were off to Harvard! The lecture room was packed, and Paul read from his notes for about forty-five minutes and graciously answered questions. At one moment he described the perfect angel investors as "people who themselves got rich from technology." As he said this, he must #8217;ve noticed the roomful of aspiring founders all widen their eyes with hopefulness. He abruptly clarified: "Oh, not me!" The rumble of one hundred simultaneously disappointed nerds echoed through the room. Graham would look back on this moment as the instant he realized a little money could go a long way for the right founders. After all, he #8217;d just told them, "You need three things to create a successful startup: to start with good people, to make something customers actually want, and to spend as little money as possible. Most startups that fail do it because they fail at one of these. A startup that does all three will probably succeed." After he finished, Steve made a beeline for him to get an autograph, and I followed. When it was my turn, I informed him that we #8217;d come all the way from Virginia and said (rather boldly), "It #8217;d totally be worth the cost of buying you a drink to get your opinion of our startup." He agreed, probably impressed by our pilgrimage, set a time for the meeting, and asked if I knew "the kiosk." We #8217;d meet there. I was so excited that I nodded without thinking. Of course, I had no idea where "the kiosk" was, but that didn #8217;t stop me from dancing a quick jig in "the hallway. After asking a good half dozen strangers, we learned it was, in fact, just a kiosk in the middle of Harvard Square. There #8217;s one more reason I didn #8217;t go to Harvard. We met Paul that night as planned and sat down for coffee at Caf #233; Algiers to discuss our idea. The plan had been that Steve would impress him with his programming acumen and, once we #8217;d established our competence, I #8217;d slide in with the pitch. Instead, Paul just looked at me and said, "Let #8217;s hear it." I didn #8217;t get more than a few sentences in. Paul loved it. Steve still fondly remembers this as an awesome moment of validation. Here was one of his heroes saying that the idea we #8217;d had to start a company wasn #8217;t awful. In fact, he said we had a pretty good shot at making it work. I don #8217;t remember the odds he gave us, but they reinforced our belief that we #8217;d made the right choice. I know I was relieved, since it was me who was dragging Steve away from a well-paying job at a company he liked. I didn #8217;t want to deal with the wrath of his mom if things went poorly, either. We left behind our frozen geeky spring break and returned to Charlottesville enthusiastic about our prospects. I asked Steve to send a follow-up e-mail to Paul, since he was his idol, after all, and it seemed prudent to at least thank him for his time. A day or so passed, and Steve still hadn #8217;t written it, so I literally stood behind him as he typed out a quick e-mail thanking Paul. Steve reminded him that we were "those college students from Virginia." Paul responded within a couple of hours. This was a very good sign. He noted that he was thinking of starting a program to invest in early-stage founders like us and that since he #8217;d already met us, we had a pretty good shot at getting in. Then, a few weeks later, Paul announced Y Combinator, an experiment in seed-stage investing. The premise was simple: a little bit of money, guidance, and three intensive months of writing code "and talking to users could one day result in a billion-dollar company. Granted, at the end of three months, the goal was just to have gotten far enough to raise another round of funding #8212;an angel investment, typically a few hundred thousand dollars. The angels, or backers, would invest in unproven Internet entrepreneurs because so little money is required to start a website #8212;especially compared to how expensive it was when Paul Graham did it. If the founders could feed and house themselves and pay for laptops and Internet, they could launch a startup. We applied for the very first round of Y Combinator funding and were invited up to Boston for an interview on Saturday, April 9, 2005. Jessica Livingston, partner at YC, described the interview process in an e-mail:  gt; At this stage we believe you are technically capable, so we plan to spend the allotted 40 minutes discussing your idea. We don #8217;t want you to give a presentation, but please come prepared to talk about:  gt; 1) Why your idea is something that people will want  gt; 2) How you will sell it to customers  gt; 3) How you will do this better than your competitors This was a tremendous change from most tech-related interviews. There were no thought exercises like "Why are manholes round?" or stress tests with yelling and "big swinging dicks" #8212;they wanted to see us at our best, not flustered. Jessica greeted us at the door with a smile. When our time came, we had a lively discussion with Paul and his partners at the table: Jessica, Robert Morris, and Trevor Blackwell. Once it was all done, we still felt pretty good about our odds. He #8217;d been so excited for our startup just a month earlier. Getting the rejection call from Paul that night wasn #8217;t easy. Steve and I dealt with it as best as we could, telling one another we #8217;d prove Y Combinator wrong. Fortunately, there was a cure for our disappointment: beer. After doing some damage at the Border Cafe in Harvard Square, we went out with the pal who was putting us up. He was a Harvard graduate and took us to one of the scenes frequented by final club members (read: Harvard frat guys). I distinctly remember being introduced to some successful alums who were talking about finance jobs. They asked what we were doing with our lives. Drunkenly, I said something about how we were in town fund-raising for our startup and had just gotten funding from this new firm called Y Combinator. Ugh. I felt so dirty when the words came out of my mouth, but I was so ashamed I couldn #8217;t bring myself to admit our failure out loud. They weren #8217;t even impressed; for some reason I thought they would be. Never again. The conversation had drifted back to something else, probably the girls in the bar they were eyeing, and I staggered outside for some air. I love being outside at night #8212;maybe it #8217;s the lack of sunlight, but I was really disappointed with myself. (Hey, if you Harvard alums from that night are reading this, I was lying because I was so embarrassed "about being rejected by Y Combinator #8212;I grew up in the generation of kids who got trophies for everything, so the first big rejection in my life really, really sucked.) I had to accept it. We were rejected. And I was going to do everything I could to prove them wrong. Steve and I would show them that we didn #8217;t need to be in their summer camp for startups. We #8217;d go back down to Charlottesville and work with renewed vigor on an idea that would change the world #8212;once we recovered from our hangovers. Then everything changed with a phone call. Somewhere in the middle of Connecticut, on an exceptionally long train ride back to Virginia, my cell phone rang. It was Paul Graham. He wanted us back, but only if we changed our idea to something else. So much for proving them wrong. We got off at the very next stop, but not before I got Paul to buy us a pair of tickets to fly back to Charlottesville that night so we could return to Boston for an hour to join him in "brainstorming a better idea than mobile food ordering. The big problem with the concept was that not only did we have to persuade customers to use the product, but because this was a time before app stores, the only way to get our software on people #8217;s phones was to make deals with mobile carriers first. That alone would #8217;ve been an impressive feat for a brand-new company of two, but we #8217;d also need to get restaurateurs #8212;notoriously late adopters #8212;on board as well. Yikes. We got back to the Y Combinator office and met with Paul Graham alone, without his partners. He told us to forget mobile for a moment and consider building something for the browser. Long before most people realized the power of online software, he knew the Internet offered tremendous potential for an idea to spread as never before. When a customer only needs a browser and an Internet connection to access your product, unprecedented growth is possible. He asked us about frustrations we had using the Internet, which had just recently seen the launch of a college-only site called TheFacebook.com. Steve was an avid reader of Slashdot, a news website with editorial oversight and "a robust community of commenters as well as a moderation system. I had too many tabs open every day #8212;they showed me a range of news websites, but I had no way to filter signal from noise. At the time, a website called del.icio.us (pronounced "delicious"; ignore the dots) let people bookmark websites online, so if you hopped between computers, your reference material followed you. An interesting by-product of this was del.icio.us/popular, which aggregated the most popular bookmarked URLs at any given time. There was something here that del.icio.us wasn #8217;t quite getting, but we saw the potential for something bigger, which would sort not the most popular links for bookmarking but the most popular links for sharing. We hadn #8217;t figured out functionality, but we knew the old model for news aggregation, when it was printed on a dead tree, wasn #8217;t suited for the Internet age. In fact, the vision was best crystallized by Paul Graham in that very meeting: "That #8217;s it! You should build the front page of the web."</TEXT>

    <TITLE>On being a "non-technical founder"</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-06-13 20:16:45</DATE>
    <TEXT>[Inspired by this r/startups post](https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/6gzv6x/what_should_nontechnical_cofounders_focus_on/), I wrote this up (and cribbed some of it from [my book).](https://www.amazon.com/Without-Their-Permission-Reddit-Blueprint/dp/1455520012/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8 amp;qid= amp;sr=) I was in the first batch of Y Combinator, but I was also one of the first non-technical founder to go through the program. Y Combinator, with Paul Graham at the helm, was oriented heavily toward developers, who really do have all the leverage in this industry. I was one of only two  #8220;non-technical founders #8221; in the program. Despite having programming experience in high school and college, I was devoting my time to doing  #8220;everything else #8221; at the company, though that assertion was met with quite a bit of skepticism. A running joke that Steve had to endure at Y Combinator meetings was  #8220;What does Alexis do? #8221; All PG knew was I created the mascot and came up with the name, but I wasn't a 'hacker' so I must not have much value at an early stage startup. The reality is, until you've got a product and users, a non-technical founder has to be willing to do all the 'everything else' work that's not programming. That's everything from ordering lunch, to maintaining finances, to logging notes. Fortunately, I was also enough of a programmer/web-designer to be dangerous and propose product and debate strategy. But the goal as the non-technical founder is to get to users as soon as possible, because that's when you have to shine as the point person talking to them, learning from them. To my fellow non-technical founders: work hard, be egoless, and learn to code (or at least build a website), because it's one of the best things you can do for your career.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In Reddit's case, I'd bring my laptop to Starbucks and sit with people for an afternoon taking notes while they used the site, thinking out loud, and answering my questions afterwards. I should find those notes, but I'd bring those back and synthesize them into a report that I'd discuss with Steve. That feedback also went directly into my designs + mockups. For instance, we didn't originally have up / down arrows, but we got there after watching enough people confused by the site until they saw up + down arrows letting them vote *up* or *down* the headlines in the list. Plenty of businesses just get an MVP out now with a simple landing page to collect signups. If you're a non-technical founder who doesn't want to take the time to spend an afternoon at a cafe talking to users or learn enough HTML to build a website -- quit now, because you don't have what it takes to be a founder.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>We need your voice as we continue the fight for net neutrality</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-07-12 14:01:58</DATE>
    <TEXT>My fellow [redditors](https://www.reddit.com/mobile/download), When Steve and I created this site twelve years ago, our vision was simple but powerful. We wanted to create an open platform for communities and their members to find and discuss the content they found most interesting. And today, that principle is exactly what net neutrality is all about: preserving an open internet with consumer choice and unimpeded access to information. Net neutrality ensures that the free market #8212;not big cable #8212;picks the winners and losers. This is a [bipartisan issue](https://www.reddit.com/r/comics/comments/6c2mzt/antinet_neutrality_is_everyones_problem/), and we at Reddit will continue to fight for it. We #8217;ve been here [before](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/2sjkf0/join_us_in_a_final_push_for_net_neutrality_its_as/), and this time we #8217;re facing even worse odds. But as we all know, you should never tell redditors the odds. ### A level playing field Net neutrality gives new ideas, online businesses, and up-and-coming sites #8212;like Reddit was twelve years ago #8212;the opportunity to find an audience and grow on a level playing field. Saving net neutrality is crucial for the future of entrepreneurship in the digital age. We weren #8217;t always in the [top ten most-viewed sites in the U.S.](http://www.alexa.com/topsites/countries/US) When Steve and I started Reddit right out of college, we were just two kids with $12K in funding and some computers in Medford, MA. Our plan was to make something people wanted, because we knew if we accomplished that, we could win #8212;even against massive incumbents. But we wouldn #8217;t have succeeded if users had to pay extra to visit our website, or if better-funded alternatives loaded faster. Our start-up got to live the American dream thanks to the open internet, and I want to be able to tell aspiring entrepreneurs with a straight face that they can build the next Reddit. If we lose net neutrality, I can #8217;t tell them that. ### We did it, Reddit, and we can do it again. You all are capable of creating movements. I #8217;ve had a front-row seat to witness the power of Reddit communities to rally behind a common goal #8212;starting when you all named a whale [Mister Splashy Pants](https://www.ted.com/talks/alexis_ohanian_how_to_make_a_splash_in_social_media) in 2007. It #8217;s been heartening to watch your collective creativity and energy over the years; it #8217;s easy to take all these amazing moments of community and conversation for granted, but the thing that makes them all possible is the open internet, which unites redditors as an issue above all. Here #8217;s a quick recap: * In 2012, [we coordinated with mods to black out the website to protest SOPA  amp; PIPA](https://redditblog.com/2012/01/10/stopped-they-must-be-on-this-all-depends/). They called these two bills  #8220;inevitable #8221; in DC until America spoke up and they became  #8220;unthinkable. #8221; * Then, [you all crowdfunded a bus we took through the heartland to support the open internet](http://www.adweek.com/digital/inside-reddits-internet-2012-bus-144244/). * Back in 2014, [you all rallied to deluge the FCC with thoughtful comments in support of net neutrality](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/275mqp/reddit_there_are_only_45000_comments_on_the_fccs/), and [we collected your best comments for our own letter to the FCC](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/2aohmu/reddit_is_filing_an_fcc_comment_to_fight_for_an/). * [You crowdfunded $20,000 to put up net neutrality ads across DC](https://www.theverge.com/2014/5/13/5711012/net-neutrality-protest-posters-go-up-across-washington-ahead-of-fcc-vote). * In the span of a few hours, [you made over 15,000 phone calls to the FCC and your representatives](https://redditblog.com/2015/01/15/join-us-in-a-final-push-for-net-neutrality-its-as-easy-as-calling-858-wheeler/)! And all of this actually *worked*. It #8217;s not just about the U.S., because [redditors in India have used the site to defend net neutrality](https://redditblog.com/podcast/a-neutral-net-part-two/) and the CRTC (the Canadian equivalent of the FCC) [visited r/Canada for a thoughtful (and 99% upvoted!) discussion with citizens](https://np.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/54kz6g/im_from_the_crtc_and_we_want_to_know_what_you/). Reddit is simply too large to ignore, and you all did all of this when we were just a fraction of the size we are today. ### Time to get back to work We #8217;re proud to join major internet companies like Amazon, Etsy, Twitter, and Netflix ([better late than never!](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/06/15/netflix-joining-next-months-net-neutrality-protest-says-it-will-never-outgrow-the-fight/)) in today #8217;s Day of Action to Save Net Neutrality, orchestrated by Fight for the Future. We #8217;ve already been hosting AMAs on the subject with politicians (like [Senator Schatz](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/6k27ny/im_us_senator_brian_schatz_lead_democrat_on_the/)) and journalists (like [Brian Fung from the Washington Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/6lfkwh/im_brian_fung_a_washington_post_reporter_covering/)). Today we #8217;re changing our logo and sharing a special message from Steve, our CEO, with every visitor to our front page to raise awareness and send people to **[BattleForTheNet.com](http://battleforthenet.com)**. Most exciting, [dozens of communities on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/6g9pkl/reddit_lets_get_organized_more_than_30_subreddits/) (with millions of subscribers) across party lines and interest areas have joined the cause. If your community hasn #8217;t joined in yet, now #8217;s the time! (And you #8217;ll be in good company: u/Here_Comes_The_King is on our side.) *The FCC [is deciding this issue the way big cable and ISPs want it to](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/05/18/fcc-votes-to-start-rolling-back-landmark-net-neutrality-rules/?utm_term=.b7242cbf9cd1), so it #8217;s on us as citizens to tell them #8212;and our representatives in the Senate and House #8212;how important the open internet is to our economy, our society, and especially for when we #8217;re bored at work.* I invite everyone who cares about this across the internet to come talk about it with us on Reddit. Join the conversation, upvote stories about net neutrality #8217;s importance to keep them top of mind, [make a high-quality GIF or two](https://www.reddit.com/r/HighQualityGifs/comments/6gnyl4/giffing_for_net_neutrality/), and, most importantly, [contact the FCC](https://www.battleforthenet.com/) to let them know why *you* care about protecting the open internet. This is how we win: when every elected official realizes how vital net neutrality is to all of their constituents. --Alexis **Comment on this post with why net neutrality is important to you! We #8217;re visiting D.C. next month, so if you're an American, add your representatives' names to your comment, we #8217;ll do our best to share your stories with them on Capitol Hill!**</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Technically, Steve and I are from Virginia + BK/MD respectively, but we did start Reddit in Medford. I love this fiction, but you touched on something we think is pretty remarkable about Reddit. For hundreds of years, we've thought of commerce as something done between two people who have some connection to one another in the offline world: lovers, colleagues, friends, a carnation for that shy kid in your algebra class, etc. Reddit has proven that there's another type of commerce, between 'strangers' that is actually not only desired (world record setting gift exchanges) but also in a strange way *more* satisfying than gifting someone you know offline. We're really focused on a lot of core Reddit product right now, but one day we'll be able to see just far you all can go with gifting between a global audience of 300M+ MAU and a sense of connection + community that is stronger and more real and personal than anything we know offline.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Advertising. Our native ads were ahead of their time - we launched them in 2008 or 2009 back when everyone was still obsessed with banner ads because we wanted the ads to not suck. It turns out our native ads are *highly* engaging because they're all conversations, which redditors love to read and comment and vote on. Reddit gold has a place in the future, for sure, but we can't prioritize it right now.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In the same way that we can't convince people to stop being Cowboys fans the first or even the second time we meet with them--each visit makes progress. Talking to these Senators + Reps helps both demystify Reddit and also give them our perspective as small business owners and technologists. These elected officials need to get quick expertise in a broad range of subjects and there are rarely tech experts in the room (which is how a lot of bad tech bills get written, not malice, but ignorance) so these long-term relationships are valuable for us, as well as them, because we can be resources for one another. Besides, once they meet u/spez and our new head of policy, they're quite impressed. The meetings already feel much more productive than back during SOPA/PIPA.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I can #8217;t believe it #8217;s already been 2 years since Steve and I came back to Reddit full-time.</TITLE>

    <TEXT>*[Here's Steve's blog post](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/6qptzw/with_so_much_going_on_in_the_world_i_thought_id/)* Raising capital is not a cause for celebration, but it is a milestone, a brief chance to look back before all eyes are forward again. We have smart partners -- a16z, Coatue, Fidelity, Sequoia, and VY -- who know that it #8217;s all about the long-term. And the long-term future of social media trends toward authenticity. We believe that happens best when people are liberated from the constraint of their Government Name and join communities that share their passions. Reddit will be the conversation layer for the internet. You #8217;re going to see a lot of numbers today, but the ones that matter are we #8217;re now over 300M monthly active users across tens of thousands of communities and growing; the business has grown significantly with top-tier companies like Toyota, NBCUniversal, and Amazon; and  #8212; most importantly  #8212; we #8217;ve now got over 230 Snoos making all of this happen. [I #8217;m so proud of the job Steve has done as CEO](https://www.facebook.com/alexis.ohanian/videos/vb.1502254/10103768488495656/?type=2 amp;theater) and I #8217;m even more proud of what the team has accomplished in just 2 years. Just wait until 2 years from now when we #8217;re looking back on everything we #8217;ve accomplished since. The sleeping giant of social media is wide awake. Thank you for helping us get this far and for everywhere we #8217;ll go together.  #11014; #65039; Now back to work.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I luckily had two really supportive parents (who didn't have a lot, but saved enough to buy a really important 486SX for our family even though they had no idea how to use it) brainwashed me into thinking that if I worked really hard, I could do anything I wanted. Growing up, *what* that was changed wildly (though being a pro football player was ruled out pretty early) but, frankly, I did always feel like I was going to do something big. It wasn't anything specific, nor could I even comprehend something on the scale of Reddit -- and there's a lot of survival bias here -- but I did have some gut feeling that I wanted to (and almost had to) do something to earn my lucky draw. One of my earliest childhood memories was my great aunt Vera explaining to me that my birthday (April 24th) is a really important day for our family because it commemorated the Armenian Genocide and that I had a responsibility to not squander all the opportunities I had that the rest of the family had sacrificed for. No pressure, right? But I reflected on it a lot over the years. It wasn't absolute confidence, I've felt imposter syndrome, and there were periods of intense sadness, but that confidence my parents (especially my mother) put in me was a consistent foundation that I anchored to often, even -- or especially -- after she passed. I've been lucky enough to get to know far more impressive people than me and they all have a similar confidence, but, there's something that someone, like, say, u/serenawilliams has, that is really next level. For all 34 years of my life, even when I was just that random UVA kid in the photo, every room that I walked into was prepared to take me seriously as a business person, technologist, investor, media expert, whatever I needed to be in that situation. That foundation of confidence was a gift from my parents, but being a tall ([yeah, we get paid more](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/05/the-financial-perks-of-being-tall/393518/)) white guy in the USA was getting to do it all on easy mode. It's humbling to even consider how much more confidence, mental strength, endurance, and ability it must take to 'do something big' when you're playing the game on a way harder difficulty setting. I've thought about it a lot over my career, tried to help groups leveling the playing field like BlackGirlsCode and Donorschoose, and admired it from the great people I met and worked with, but in the last few years I've gotten a front row seat to it with the woman I love. That said, you probably would have hated me in college, I was pretty obnoxious.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think I feel OK about her having split loyalty because neither franchise is particularly good (but we have a storied history we can't let go of - and we split two Super Bowls); we're in different conferences; her mom *is* an owner of the Dolphins; and this baby will be a huge Serena fan so she'll get to cheer for at least one consistent winner.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>They've been super supportive. I put them outside, brought the baby inside, then took those soiled blankets outside to the dogs and 'introduced them'. I put each of the dogs on their backs and rubbed their bellies while presenting them the blankets to smell and explained what was happening. Then they came inside and saw her. I introduced them to her individually briefly and they've been her bodyguards ever since. Chip puffs up when anyone approaches her and gets really concerned when she cries. He's been a great big brother.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's pretty great. I actually think entrepreneurship prepared me in useful ways for this experience, the uncertainty, thinking about her in the back of my mind 24-7, the pride, etc. But the moment I first saw her was something I'll never forget -- so many feels. Not just love, but appreciation and gratefulness that she and mom were OK.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's open now! ORLANDO, Fla.  #8212; Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian, known for his internet activism and a record of success as an investor in companies such as Instacart and Zenefits, says the next wave of social media will be driven by people #8217;s need for more authentic connections. Often, he said, people use current social platforms to create highly filtered and curated versions of themselves. To illustrate the point he shared a photo of a bowl of soup with his audience at the Gartner Symposium/ITxpo here Tuesday. Mr. Ohanian confessed that he spent about 10 minutes composing the shot of his meal, a bowl of the Vietnamese noodle soup, Pho. He said it #8217;s OK to construct and share such filtered versions of ourselves, but that the digital equivalent of bragging at a cocktail party isn #8217;t enough to sustain social media or its users over the long run.  #8220;Social will move toward authenticity  #8230; we want conversation, #8221; he told the audience. Mr. Ohanian gave the group an unfiltered view of his life by sharing a photo of himself as a 9th grader with a bowl haircut and a physique that he attributed to numerous hours at the computer. Alexis Ohanian, co-founder and executive chairman of Reddit, showed his unvarnished self -- in 9th grade, before social media -- to an audience at the Gartner Symposium/ITxpo in Orlando Fla., Oct. 3, 2017. Alexis Ohanian, co-founder and executive chairman of Reddit, showed his unvarnished self -- in 9th grade, before social media -- to an audience at the Gartner Symposium/ITxpo in Orlando Fla., Oct. 3, 2017. PHOTO: STEVE ROSENBUSH/WALL STREET JOURNAL The idea of authenticity is woven into his view of startups and innovation. He urged the audience not to worry about failure or less-than-perfect beginnings, sharing screenshots of early versions of Facebook and Twitter.  #8220;The first version of everything is going to be janky, and that #8217;s okay. It will evolve, #8221; he said. Mr. Ohanian said he looks beyond Silicon Valley for good ideas, and is known for getting on a bus and traveling to meet people. As an investor, he has been affiliated with the startup accelerator Y Combinator and later launched venture capital fund Initialized Capital. He has launched a range of other ventures as an entrepreneur. The key is to create something that people want to use. Reddit wasn #8217;t founded with a grand vision but with a desire to create something of value to users, he said. What people get wrong about startups, he said, is to focus on matters such as marketing before they know they can  #8220;make something that people will love. #8221;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>[I bought your track on bandcamp,](https://virtuosystem.bandcamp.com/) (found via a link you posted on r/wearethemusicmakers discovered via a search for royalty-free music). The video was originally shared on Serena's IG story, where there's no way to attribute (per the cc license, ["Give appropriate credit, provide a link to the license, and indicate if changes were made. You may do so in any reasonable manner, but not in any way that suggests the licensor endorses you or your use."](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/3.0/)) The other place it was posted was on her Reddit profile (where again there is unfortunately no description, so I thought the best way to do attribution was [post a comment crediting you and notifying you that we'd used your song.](https://www.reddit.com/user/serenawilliams/comments/6zujc3/we_made_this/dmyxd9l/)) I did then post it on YouTube (especially once the people started ripping the IG stories) and put it under a CC license as well, turned off advertisements, and just didn't think to add any description. My oversight. I'm disappointed **[in myself]** that wasn't sufficient (my intention wasn't to deny you credit) and I totally understand. Since it's now also living on YouTube, I've updated the description to include the following:  gt; The background music ("Innocence" by Virtuo System) is under a (cc) Attribution-NoDerivs 3.0 Unported (CC BY-ND 3.0) license. No changes were made. https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/3.0/  gt; "Innocence" by Virtuo System can be found here: https://virtuosystem.bandcamp.com/ Sorry for the mistake. *Lots of edits for poor 4am grammar and some baby-induced confusion.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I burst with pride when I see the Reddit community continue to lead the fight for the open internet. It's important for everyone to remember this is going to be a very long process. We knew even back when we defeated SOPA and PIPA (remember - those bills were considered 'inevitable' by all the DC experts, [until we all spoke up and reps realized they were 'unthinkable'](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/sopa-and-pipa-internet-blackout-aftermath-staggering-numbers/)) as well as when we got Title II [(and that thank you from POTUS)](https://redditblog.com/2015/02/26/thank-you-reddit-your-efforts-led-to-an-historic-fcc-ruling-and-this-note-from-the-president-of-the-united-states/) that this was far from over and while this recent news is very much in the wrong direction, [we have the support of millions of Americans across both parties](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/6mtgtp/we_need_your_voice_as_we_continue_the_fight_for/) -- that last NN blog post was one of our most popular and viewed, ever. We, the people, will have our voices heard in DC. Your phone calls matter! And we at Reddit Inc will get your best comments to your representatives. As always, thank you. If we hadn't had an internet where all links were equal, Reddit may not have come to fruition, simply because we couldn't get access to our audience because of a deal a competitor made with an ISP. I also can't imagine [an internet like the net-neutrality-less Portuguese have, with different priced 'packages' of service](https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/22/16691506/portugal-meo-internet-packages-net-neutrality-ajit-pai-plan) -- innovation and creativity thrive online precisely because our browsers are a gateway of choice.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You #8217;ve been asking about the Upvoted podcast for a long time now and I #8217;m so happy to finally be able to announce its rebirth as a partnership between WBUR (Boston #8217;s NPR affiliate, best known for Car Talk + Modern Love) and Reddit  #8212; the new podcast will be called Endless Thread. u/cat_sweaterz has been working on this podcast project (after helping create the first season of Upvoted) for the the past year and a half and I #8217;m so proud of the work he and everyone has done to get us here. When we first launched the Upvoted podcast, one snarky reviewer said it was  #8220;unsuccessful on almost every level #8221; (great motivation) but after over 2M downloads, we knew we were on to something with Season 1 and a producer at WBUR reached out to us about making Season 2. Admittedly, Michael and I recorded the 1st season on a shoestring budget and often did my VO in a closet  #8212; we were excited about the idea of bringing on pros. What came out of those discussions was to do something a little different with Endless Thread and I think you #8217;ll be very excited to hear what they #8217;ve come up with! [Ben Brock Johnson and Amory Sivertson are the awesome producers making Endless Thread and are going to do a great job - read their r/podcasts AMA here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/podcasts/comments/7hq7tl/were_ben_brock_johnson_and_amory_sivertson/)</TEXT>

I got more serious about college because of the privilege I had thanks to my great aunt funding a big part of it and having scholarships for the rest -- I needed to make the most out of this and worked hard, too hard, to get good grades. I spent most of my time in the library. I enjoyed it at the time, but if I could do it again I'd have spent a lot less time studying.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>She was truly selfless--maybe even to a fault--for her family, but especially for me, her only child. I got every bit of my confidence from her encouraging me, like scraping money together for me to get my first computer (486SX) to finding me a summer camp or a community college class for whatever I was into at the time: art, drama, football, CAD, whatever. And then when things got bad, when she got diagnosed with terminal brain cancer, she never let me feel guilty for working on my startup (Reddit) up in Boston while she and my dad were dealing with her chemo treatments in Baltimore. Her very first words to me when I saw her at the hospital were "I'm sorry." That's how selfless she was.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Good thing Guilded didn't exist a couple decades ago when I was learning to code or maybe there wouldn't be a Reddit</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-04-10 00:15:17</DATE>
    <TEXT>Even before we invested, I #8217;ve been enamored with #160;[Guilded](https://www.guilded.gg/) #8202; #8212; #8202;a platform to find, manage and challenge online gaming teams. Chiefly, they have done a brilliant job building something people love by engaging directly and authentically with gaming communities on Reddit. In addition, they #8217;re building the very software I wish I #8217;d had all those years ago when I had more time to game, let alone enough time to run a gaming team! [Quake II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quake_II) #160;helped me learn to code. It wasn #8217;t long after I started playing that I noticed \[clan\] tags next to some #8202; #8212; #8202;usually the best #8202; #8212; #8202;player #8217;s names. I needed to be in a Quake II clan. After trying a few different teams, I inevitably needed to start my own. This gave me an excuse to learn HTML so I could build and maintain our team #8217;s website. That prepared me pretty well for my career in tech. Believe it or not, it took two decades for the Guilded team to come along and build a solution that integrated all of the fundamental things a gaming team needs into one service including a calendar, forums, website builder and wikis. [Guilded is helping manage the top professional gaming franchises #8202; #8212; #8202;it can definitely handle your gaming #160;team.](https://i.redd.it/z32t61wtiyq01.png) Just last week, #160;[the team at Guilded rolled out a major product update with some of the top esports franchises on board](https://medium.com/guilded/the-new-guilded-1c6aaed02d3d). As an early stage investor, we make our living making big bets on founders when the product and traction are often still nascent. At the time we invested, there was already a strong signal that this team was making something people love because Eli, the founder and CEO, was building the product right along with his audience on Reddit. With a community on Reddit for every game, there was no better place to start finding users. Fittingly, Eli approached building the product similar to how we approached building Reddit: by talking to our users #8202; #8212; #8202;on Reddit. Eli #8217;s been doing this since he launched, which was not only beneficial for him but also a gift for the community he was a part of and wanted to build something for.[ Just last week...](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/8a3m1f/we_just_partnered_with_a_bunch_of_pro_lol_teams/?utm_content=timestamp amp;utm_medium=post_embed amp;utm_name=20e5264c701d47808a0ecb9238d22515 amp;utm_source=embedly amp;utm_term=8a3m1f) [Just one example of founder CEO Eli talking to his users.](https://i.redd.it/hefvtfp4jyq01.png) # # What are you waiting for? Talk to your customers Too many founders are concerned with getting it perfect for a Hollywood\-style launch. Build something that #8217;s good enough to solve a problem, get it out to some of the people who need it most and talk to them. #160;I #8217;d have to offer people free coffee around Davis Square in Medford, Massachusetts to get them to sit down with me and try Reddit in order to learn what they thought and see how they used the product. That was 2005. But even when things went badly \(e.g., the site would go down for a few hours\), we #8217;d never think of banning the top post on the site, which inevitably was about how dumb we were. Rather, we got in the comments and explained what went wrong and how we were going to improve. People really respected that. It #8217;s fitting that learning how to build a website for my videogame team led me to build Reddit, which has now helped Eli build a website to manage these teams for the community on Reddit. When you #8217;re getting started, being an engaged founder within your community of earliest adopters carries real weight, especially if it #8217;s a community product. It shows them you give a damn, which builds loyalty, \(because you #8217;ll need that when you inevitably misstep\). And it gets you close to your core customers, who you #8217;ll need to make the right decisions about product and the business.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>From Father of Snoo to Father of Olympia, being a Father is the best. I'm doing an AMA live on Instagram about dad life.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-06-05 21:08:15</DATE>
    <TEXT>[Here's the link!](https://www.instagram.com/p/BjppRUKhBxE/?taken-by=alexisohanian) Ask me anything in the comments and chat with me on Instagram Live RIGHT NOW. **Update!** Top 10 Dad Tips based on questions from that IG Live session I hosted with my good friends at Johnnie Walker in celebration of my first real Father #8217;s Day. (I tried to save the video from the first hour, but it crashed, so I only have the 20minutes I did after that) 1. Take care of yourselves, dads (and dads\-to\-be!). The day I found out I was going to be a father was the day I started changing my lifestyle. I fully support having a more healthy and active lifestyle and encourage doing everything in moderation! Don #8217;t get me wrong I like to celebrate here and there but moderation is key. When I do choose to toast to a special milestone (like Father #8217;s Day), I like to have a glass of the good stuff #8212;Johnnie Walker Blue Label. I've done an OK job taking care of myself for my first 34 years and I promised the little poppy seed I would spend my next 34 doing a much better job so I could be around and at my best for as long as possible. Or long enough to be uploaded. 2. I'm finding ways to connect with her even at this early age that are special for the two of us. Most of them involve me making her feel like she's either in a jet, rocketship, or racecar, but between the sound effects and all the movement she really has a great time. I talk to her a little bit in German and I wish I could speak more French to my daughter, because she's learning from her mom and nanny and I just know it's going to be their secret language to plot against me. 3. Don't try to do everything perfectly. There's no one way to be a dad and none of us are perfect. She's gonna hurt herself, or she's going to be sad and you can't quite figure out why, or you're going to be staring at her at 4am wondering what it was like to get a full night of sleep \-\- and it's OK to be frustrated. No one is perfect, your kid is going to be OK, just keep doing your best and tell your partner you love them, often. Don #8217;t be too hard on yourself. Fatherhood is an incredible journey and it is worth taking a step back to celebrate the small wins (your first diaper changed!) along with the big wins (first steps!)  #8212; everything matters. Be sure to take it all in. Enjoy a glass of Johnnie Walker Blue Label to celebrate all the moments along the way with your partner. 4. There's no one book to rule them all. I think it's worth reading a couple, but they're suggestions and ideas, not instruction manuals. Every kid is different, but it is valuable to get ideas. [Like the baby football method for soothing a baby!](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bc3JNR1BWK3/?hl=en) I learned that from the *Happiest Baby on the Block*. 5. Take full advantage of your parental leave policy. If you don't have one at your company and can do something about it, you should. Both Reddit and Initialized have fantastic 16 week programs for parents and I hope more companies follow suit because it's a huge asset when a workforce believes there's a process for taking time to be with their families and their jobs won't be at risk while they're away. 6. Double or triple up the layers of changing pads on the changing table so that you can just tear one away in the middle of the night if it gets soiled and not worry about finding a replacement at that moment because you just want to be done and put the baby back to sleep. 7. I know it's not cheap, but I (and Junior) loved the Snoo bed (and not just because of the name) for the first 6 months or so. 8. Take photos and videos, lots of them. I know it takes up a lot of space on your phone and I'm trying to build a better solution myself, but you'll want those. More importantly your kid will want the best ones of those. Make some selfie videos with you and your partner, too. [You can even stitch them all\-together into a video for your kid later.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYoRmfI0LUc) 9. Don't forget about your partner. You need to be at your best to be the best parents and a big part of that is loving your other half. Agree ahead of time that things said at 4am while sleep deprived and with a baby crying are 'safe' from being used against you later, that is to say, be forgiving (thanks, Serena) and make sure you get time for yourselves, too. Nurture that relationship because it's the bedrock of your new kid's life. 10. Subscribe to and read r/daddit (and r/predaddit)! It's been helpful all along the way. And here's a bonus dad joke (from r/dadjokes) *If you put your left shoe on the wrong foot...* *It #8217;s on the right foot* [https://www.reddit.com/r/dadjokes/comments/8ortjl/if\_you\_put\_your\_left\_shoe\_on\_the\_wrong\_foot/](https://www.reddit.com/r/dadjokes/comments/8ortjl/if_you_put_your_left_shoe_on_the_wrong_foot/) Cheers!</TEXT>

I wish I had infinite energy for her - I'm eating better and exercising more than ever since I found out I'd be a dad but even with amazing help and a fantastic wife, I still run out of gas when I'm with her for extended periods -- it's frustrating and makes me go a little harder in the gym the next day.

    <TEXT>What a happy lovely little baby! You're quite welcome \-\- this is what I hope Reddit can continue to do for people all over the world\-\-helping them find homes and communities where geography isn't a constraint. We still have a lot more work to do but there are a few hundred amazing, hard\-working Snoos at HQ who are making it happen every day.</TEXT>

He told me about Conde Nast (I'd never heard of them) and asked if we'd considered licensing before, doing a white-label version of Reddit, and I said, sure we have (we hadn't) but that it would be some work so I'd have to talk it over with the engineers before we could have a real discussion about it. Said I'd get back to him and we arranged to continue over email until we eventually met up in person.</TEXT>
