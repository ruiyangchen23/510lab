    <TEXT>Thank you! I took this photo a few days after Hurricane Harvey left, so the HOV lane I was in was closed. This photo is from two exposures. The one for the highway lights was 45 seconds or so and the one for the moon was like less than a second. I couldn't get it in one single shot because the moon would be too bright for a 45 second exposure and would just look like a white ball, so I combined the two!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks. I'm genuinely curious, though: do you usually post hollow and trifling comments? Instead of being sarcastic, why not give me tips on how to get the photo in one exposure? I explained in another comment why I had to blend two exposures. Other than using expensive ND grad filters, do you have any other suggestions to creating this photo with a single exposure?</TEXT>

Edit: I didn't see the last part of your comment, so to answer that, I took that photo of the moon. It was at the same spot, on the same night. It was the night before the 100% full moon.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, I totally understand. I can see why some people don't like these kinds of photos, but I wanted the moon in here to capture an extra aspect of Houston and our space program. Yeah, maybe I won't tell people it's a stacked exposure, but isn't part of photography to recreate what we see with our eyes? I mean, to my camera, either the highway looks black and the moon looks natural or the highway looks natural and the moon looks white. But in reality, to my eyes, both look detailed. Pretty much all sunset/sunrise photos need to composited for the same reasons as this photo, but that doesn't make the photos look worse to me. Everyone has their own tastes and some people are gonna think my photos look like shit but that's just something you gotta live with. Thanks for your perspective! Edit: A word</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks! Yeah, that's an unfortunate, but also fun result of using a super telephoto lens. Telephoto lenses make the background (things far away like the moon) look huge in comparison to the foreground. If I used my wide-angle lens, I'd end up with a tiny star-looking speck in the sky. I'm not good at explaining this kind of stuff, so this youtube video could help: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fzh9eQDhL4</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I used a super telephoto lens to make it look so huge! If you shoot from far away, you can make the foreground look normal, while making things extremely far away like the moon look huge. Here's an example (not my photo!) of this being done with the sun: https://www.flickr.com/photos/zaruka/36978499711/ This video explains it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fzh9eQDhL4</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If any of you want to hike out here, rent or bring snowshoes. My group rented some snowshoes but didn't see any ice at the beginning of the trail. Pretty much everything after the first half mile is icy and you will fall. A lot. Please keep my tailbone in your prayers. P.S. I doubt this will ever reach you, but to the two ladies that flashed me at the falls, I just want to say *nice*</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Definitely! I didn't have any microspikes, though... I don't like using them so much because you have to take them off when the trail clears up or else the spikes get worn out. But at $15-20 per pair, I feel like I'd be willing to roll the dice</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Make him one of those trainers that helps players stretch during games. It's late in the 4th quarter. James Harden checks out of the game to get a breather. His hammies are feeling a bit tight. A consequence of being so thick, but a small price to pay to be so massive and solid. "Hey Bobby," Harden hollers. "My hamstrings are acting up, can you help me sort this out?" "I don't know... *Can I?*" Bobby quips. "Hehe, you know what I mean. *Will* you?" says Harden. A concealed smirk flashes across Bobby's face and disappears as quickly as it appeared. "You really know how to rustle my jimmies, don't you?" asks Harden, blushing. "Heh, yeah," "...I wish I could rustle with you, Jimmy." Bobby murmers. Shivers run down Harden's spine; hairs on his neck stand attentive. Wide-eyed, asks "Wait, what?" "You heard that??" asks Bobby. "I'm right next to you, Bobby... We're in public. You know we can't do this right now." says Harden, emphatically. A brief moment of silence. For what feels like minutes, Harden and Bobby lock eyes. The gates to their souls fixed on each other. Time stops, crowd noise disappears and camera flashes halt. No one else exists in this timeline. Bobby runs his frail fingers through Harden's beard, as he expresses, "I wish we could stay like this forever. I could give everything up and we could run away from this place." It could never happen. Bobby and Harden both know it wouldn't work. Nevertheless, this doesn't shake the fact that the feelings they felt were real. They couldn't help but to at least consider the possibility. Coaches Mike, Dan, and Tony scream for Harden to check back in to the game. Time resumes and two lovers fall back to earth. "Go score 60." Bobby says, with tears in eyes. "Right..." says Harden, as he looks back to an emotional Bobby Brown. "Someday, Bobby..." It rains in Toyota Center.</TEXT>

I think Ride the Gauntlet has it. I don't want to be responsible for any emotional damage from watching it. While we're on the topic of scary, have any of you ever seen a picture of what people look like after decomposing in bathtubs? I remember I saw a picture of a lady who died during a hot bath.

    <TEXT>I love Brewer too, but not on the court. After those 2015 playoffs, I came to expect him to miss every 3 ever, open or contested. Not to mention if he was running a fast break, he'd get his shit blocked 100%. After his goat died, he was just not the same. Not even memeing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't know if I speak for any other Rockets fans here, but I think we should really shed this weird obsession with other teams misfortune. It kind of puts us in some kind of little runt brother position. We should just focus on winning out the rest of our games and focus on the playoffs. It doesn't matter how other teams are doing, if you're the best team, you're better than them and you'll win games.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Lmao thanks for reminding me of that show. I was in high school when that show came out and I thought it was hilarious and edgy. I went to Target to buy the DVDs the instant they were released. Cue my parents creeping into my room for parent reasons. They found my Super Jail DVD and thought it'd be a cute, relaxing cartoon to watch before bed. When my mom returned it, she was really quiet about it and I swear she wouldn't look me in the eye. These are the moments that make childhood something worth cherishing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>KAT in the post is honestly terrifying. He torches us. The only player on our team who can even slow him down is Nene but we can't play him big minutes. KAT plays physical and after Capela's injury against the Wolves last season, I honestly pucker up every time we play them. With that being said, the Spurs and Blazers are really damn good and historically give us problems. I'd rather not play any of them, but if I had to choose from those three, I'd rather play the Wolves.</TEXT>

I know all the players in that video are gone except James and Trev, but it's still so well-made. I honestly have *Game 6* in my YouTube favorites to rewatch every time I need to get fired up.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Most people are talking about how many points James needs to score for us to win, and I agree that he needs to score, but I feel like turnovers are gonna be the biggest thing to keep an eye out for, especially in the fourth quarter. CP3's defense will be sorely missed, but I think his ball security near the end of games is really underappreciated.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think the reason why our TO% is so low is because of CP3. He takes the ball handling load off Harden, spreads the floor to open up more passing lanes, and obviously doesn't turn the ball over often when he plays- the man holds the record for best assist/TO ratio ever. Layups could be an issue for sure. With one less 3 point threat, I feel like the paint might be a little bit more packed than usual. We'll have to rely on EG and Luc shooting well and driving to the bucket. If they shoot poorly from 3, defenders will sag off to guard the paint, then you can forget about layups tonight. The way I see it is we'll need to play a solid, complete game to pull out with a win, assuming the Dubs actually play well. We can't have high turnovers or a low-scoring game from Harden. Either that or we absolutely catch on fire and hit a record-breaking 30 3s in a game, which I'd be totally fine with.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes- the refereeing was bad, and you'd be delusional to say it wasn't, but this game wasn't decided by the referees. I agree it hurts our momentum, but only the PLAYERS can take themselves out of the game. We can't control Steph's 3s or the (non)calls, but we can control our turnovers and shot selection in crunch time. We need to do better; we have the talent and the heart to do it, but we should execute better when the going gets tough.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As much as I'd love Pat back, he said he requested to be traded. I don't know what kind of voodoo magic we'd have to do to get a team to take Ryno's contract. We could maybe throw some picks in since we're going all-in anyway. I mean, how many more years of Harden's prime are we going to get? With Clint, CP3, PJ, and Ariza? We're in a situation where we have no choice but to put all our chips in for a championship right now, be mediocre for a few years after James gets older, and then hopefully be back to compete again. I know it hurt a lot of us because we were so close and we felt like that was our one and only chance, but who knows? A few correct offseason moves will bring us back next year.</TEXT>

I love the chemistry and it's just plain fun to watch our team get along. We already have a good thing going. We already have opportunities to compete.

I mean, I'm still bummed out our season is over, but this is the happiest I've been with our team in a *long* time. When's the last time the Rockets have been this good? When's the last time we had a locker room that isn't at each other's throats 24/7? When's the last time we had a Houston treasure on our team like Gerald Green? Seeing dudes like Clint and Gerald crying made me choke up a bit, but I know they'll learn from it and come back next year with a chip on their shoulders. As for now, this season was a blessing and to say I'm thankful is an understatement.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>We tried bringing in Ty Lawson, despite the warning signs that he's a barely-functioning alcoholic. Most of us (me included) thought he'd put us over the top. Instead, we ended the season at like .500 and fired our head coach 11 games into the season. It was one of the most embarrassing Rockets seasons I've ever witnessed. Edit: forgot to say- Wall and Beal are really fun players to watch. I remembered those two + Ariza lighting up the Bulls in the 2014 playoffs and I crossed my fingers for Ariza to come to Houston and my prayers were answered.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think he strives for the most efficient shot. CP3 makes midrange shots at a high enough so he has the green light to shoot them when they're available. It's also worth considering good teams take the BEST shots available- not just good ones. For us, a team with good 3-point shooters, it's usually better to shoot the wide-open 3 instead of a midrange jumper, even if it's open. It's about maximizing points per possession, and it's clich #233;, but 3 gt;2; it's what made us as good as we were this year. Obviously, some non-midrange 2s like dunks/layups that are pretty much a guaranteed 2 points are usually even better, so that's why we push for "3s and layups." My guess is that although James is good from midrange, CP3 is even *better*, so he gets those shots. Like I said- it's not about getting good shots, it's about getting the *best* shots. But in hindsight, when we were missing our 3s in game 7, yeah, we should have tried something different. It wasn't *unsound* thinking to keep shooting the shots we usually make. Mike's philosophy is that we stick to our bread and butter. That's why he played the guys that played the best during the season and made our game plan to play the ways that were most successful. Statistics would tell you *the entire team* shouldn't have missed 27 3s in a row, but it happened anyway. He was probably thinking the shots would eventually fall. It's just one of those situations where if things go according to plan, you're a genius, but if they don't, you end up raked over hot coals. It's like when EG goes cold, a lot of us are screaming for him to stop shooting, but then he'll end up making 13 in a row and then we'll all call him "EGOD" and say D'Antoni did a great job being patient with his guys. Mike just did what he thought was right and lived with the result. P.S. Sorry for the essay, but I'm sure some of us out there don't have the time to read it since it's the offseason for us now anyway.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I mostly agree. I don't know if he was letting it go out of fear or our of maturity, but he made the right decision. Putting your hands on anyone at your workplace isn't a good look unless your workplace is a boxing ring. Even if you were Kobe, hitting a coach is still brainless, whether you're still on tv or enjoying the privacy of a locker room. It kind of says a lot about your character because it's childish to think you can punch your way out of every situation where your pride is at stake. The only court players like that belong on are civil courts.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I always love how Raptors fans cheered when he hit that. Meme or not, Linsanity was an amazing moment in world culture. It felt bigger than just basketball because it was also a big milestone for diversity in sports. I remember Jeremy talking about being the second fastest player of the 2010 draft, so sports analysts called him "deceptively athletic." Jeremy replied by saying, "I've always been deceptively 'whatever' my whole life," and that really stuck out to me, so I gave a public speech about it after I heard it. I can't really see Melo in this video, but I've heard D'Antoni saying Melo was upset with what was going on during Linsanity. Sometimes in life, opposing fans are more supportive and happy for you than your own teammates. Weird. Anyway, I hope Jeremy recovers from his injury and balls out this year.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm super late to this, so this comment will get buried, but I guess I'll post it anyway. When I was 7 or so, my parents watched movies like *Ringu* (the 1998 version), *Rose Red*, *Pet Sematary*, and *the Exorcist* with me. I loved watching scary movies, and I felt safe knowing my dog was there with me. One day, my father was mad at me for whatever reason, so he locked me in a dark closet to let me think about what I did. There was a lot more screaming and door punching than self-reflection going on. When I was let out like 30 minutes later, I think something changed in me, even if only just a little bit. I was shaken up and couldn't sleep alone, so I slept in my parents' bedroom for a while. Anyway, one summer day, I was watching Case Closed at like 4:00 AM. When the episode ended, I was exhausted and wanted nothing more than some beauty sleep. Before I could go bed, though, I had to turn off the lights like a responsible kid. The problem was that the light switch for the living room was like 30 ft away from my parents' bedroom. Turning off the lights was always my least favorite late night routine, but I knew it had to be done. So on this particular night, I shuffled over to the light switch before I could make my 30 ft sprint to the bedroom. Just as I reached up for the switch, I heard the click-clacking of my dog walking down a hardwood hallway on the opposite side of the house. I looked over, and there he was. He just stood there, looking at me, so I called for him to come to bed. No reaction. "Whatever, I guess." I thought nothing of it, turned off the lights, and booked it to the bedroom. When I got there, I quickly shut the door to so I could jump into bed. The feeling of relief was short lived, though, because on the bed was my dog. He was curled up and sleeping comfortably. I looked back at the door, but it was closed. I did not think of going outside to check what was back there for one second. I crawled under the covers and didn't sleep that night. I never saw that dog again, but that memory stuck with me. I get goosebumps and tear up every time I think about it and this time is no different. A part of me wants an explanation for what happened, but at the same time, I really don't want to know. I **honestly** wish I could just completely forget it ever happened. Edit: a word or two</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My dog passed away a couple years ago, so sometimes I imagine the dog I saw was just him coming back to visit me again. I don't know, though, because the expression on his face wasn't exactly friendly. He didn't look aggressive, but there was this empty look in his eyes that really freaks me out. Thanks for the kind wishes. The abuse extends much further than just the closet incident, sadly, but luckily, my parents split soon after and I only see my father once every five or six years. My mom thinks I still hold some kind of grudge against him, but I honestly don't hold any bitter thoughts against him. I want him to improve, but at the same time, seeing him is seriously traumatizing. I don't want anything to do with him so I can move on from that part of my life. Back on topic, funnily enough, I still can't comfortably walk past dark hallways. I always spend a second or two checking for some kind of ghost.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Pine beetles are responsible for many of the dead trees you see in recent pictures you see of Yosemite Valley, sadly. Like /u/Maverick585 said, the photo could have been taken with IR film, but usually IR photos are taken during clear days to maximize IR light reflection off leaves. Judging by the valley fog, I'd guess the photo was taken during fall, which explains the colors... After a few adjustments in Lightroom, anyway.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Was the hotel as nice on the inside as it looks on the outside? I'd say the pro of Colter Bay is its proximity to Jackson Lake and amenities like showers and canoe rentals. Gros Ventre is nice because it's less crowded and right near the Elk Refuge, so you get to watch wildlife from afar. You're also a pretty short walk away from the two Mormon barns, which are really pretty at sunrise.

    <TEXT>OP here! The in-person lottery permits you win are actually for the *next* day, not the current one, so the best thing to do is get your permit and (really invaluable) map, explore the surrounding area, relax, then head out to the Wave the next day. I actually rented a 4x4 and went up to White Pocket, which is as amazing as the Wave, in my opinion. In my excitement, I just hiked to the Wave at night with a headlamp, and got there at like 4 or 5 AM. I took some photos of the entrance then tried exploring around. It was still dark, and I didn't realize there were so many sheer drops, so I sat and watched the sunrise until the place was decently lit up. I didn't stick around long, though, because right after sunrise, the sky looked like it would end up raining, and I *really* didn't want my gear to get wet *again*, so I dipped. Fun story time: A year before this, I tried for the lottery and failed, so I went to Zion and hiked the Narrows instead. I went maybe 4 miles into it, and walked into stretch of deep water. When the water started getting up to my chest, I realized my dry bag was deflated and sopping wet. Any normal person would have headed back, but I thought, "Hyuk hyuk, no big deal," and held my camera at head-level. Well, I hit a random deep pocket of quicksand, and let's just say, the camera took a quick swim. I turned off my camera, took out the battery, and hiked back out. Long story short, my camera died anyway. Edit: 'get again'  #8594; 'get wet again'</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thank you! I actually have no idea why the colors appeared. It didn't look like iridescence or opalescence to me. Sandstone comes in several different colors due to varying minerals that leeched into the sand before it became sandstone, but the sandstone here usually doesn't look like this. My guess is that the white flashlight I used made the wet sandstone reflect colors you normally wouldn't see. If you look at daylight photos of the sandstone here, you can see it actually isn't *all* orange. I'd really love it if someone that knows a little bit of geology can explain what's really happening.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes, I'm not sure why the sandstone changed from the normal orange to those colors, though. I can only speculate, but I think it's a combination of the fresh rain the sandstone walls received, the light I used. Maybe the light's angle of incidence, wavelength, or intensity caused it? Maybe because the light exposed the sandstone a lot more than the sky, the rock looks more vibrant? Who knows!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Go for it! They're really fun if you enjoy solitude. You get whole areas entirely to yourself, and it feels like you're the first human to explore them. I do night hikes pretty often, but if you're just starting out, I'd practice a bit of hiking on safer trails! Definitely buy a headlamp and a red filter for it so you can enjoy hiking hands-free. The red filter will help preserve your night vision, but still provide enough light for you to see.</TEXT>
