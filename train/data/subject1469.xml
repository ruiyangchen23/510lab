    <TEXT>I thought people might say this but to be honest with Gini's high/high work rates he's everywhere and is brilliant at getting the ball back for me. If it starts getting too bad then i'll switch him out for someone more defensive but at the moment i think its alright</TEXT>

Robbo is in fantastic shape at the moment ofcourse, but what happens if he gets the flu? You need the next one (Moreno) still in good shape."

    <TEXT>Kane for me. watford at home and he's looking to bounce back to form so this seems like the perfect opportunity. Compared to Jesus away to west ham when city goals can come from anywhere on the pitch for them unlike spurs. However, i made sure to get both as Jesus seems nailed for the remainder of the season and is due a haul imo</TEXT>

Interesting to see what people are going with, i feel like sterling might be rested for one game with silva, sane and jesus playing both if available. But even if sterling plays 20 minutes in one of them he #8217;s likely to get some points, its so tough!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>KDB? No chance, Jesus is much more essential than him. In fact I'd put Jesus, Sterling, Sane, D.Silva, Laporte, Ederson all above him in that list. Too pricey, and produces the goals but often isnt on the end of them or in the points. In real life yes obviously he is more essential, but not in FPL atm.</TEXT>

Yeah hazard can have the occasional point haul but against liverpool i doubt it, and if they dont win that game then they #8217;ll have absolutely nothing to play for in the 2nd game, so hazard could easily be rested for that.

    <TEXT> gt;Liverpool have agreed a world record fee of  #163;66.8million with Roma for goalkeeper Alisson.  gt;  gt;The Reds have been given the green light to hold talks with the Brazil international after increasing their initial offer.  gt;  gt;Liverpool's first bid of  #163;62m, which included  #163;53m up front with a further  #163;9m in add-ons, was rejected by the Serie A outfit on Tuesday.  gt;  gt;However, Reds sporting director Michael Edwards has moved quickly to meet Roma's valuation of 75m Euros ( #163;66.8m).  gt;  gt;It remains to be seen whether Chelsea, who have also been heavily linked with Alisson, respond with a similar offer.  gt;  gt;However, Liverpool have stolen a march on the Londoners and are increasingly confident about securing Alisson's services.  gt;  gt; Liverpool have been in the market for a new No 1 since Loris Karius' disastrous performance in the Champions League final.  gt;  gt;The Reds initially feared they would miss out on Alisson with Real Madrid seemingly favourites to sign him but the landscape has changed in recent weeks with the Roma No 1 keen on the prospect of moving to Anfield.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;**J #252;rgen Klopp has revealed the expected length of Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain's injury lay-off and detailed the agreed approach taken to his rehabilitation by the club, player and manager.**  gt;  gt;The Liverpool midfielder is likely to miss the vast majority of the 2018-19 season and competitive game time before the end of the campaign would be a bonus.  gt;  gt;Oxlade-Chamberlain sustained multiple ligament damage when attempting a tackle during the first half of the Champions League tie with AS Roma at Anfield in April.  gt;  gt;The 24-year-old underwent surgery eight days after suffering the injury  #8211; his only operation  #8211; which was a complete success.  gt;  gt;The estimated length of his lay-off was not revealed at the time at the request of Oxlade-Chamberlain, who did not want the news to distract from the Reds #8217; ongoing Champions League run and the excitement surrounding it.  gt;  gt;His rehabilitation remains in line with the timeframe outlined following his surgery.  gt;  gt; #8220;It feels like now is an appropriate time to tell people that for Ox this coming season will be about focusing on recovery and rehab, #8221; Klopp told Liverpoolfc.com.  gt;  gt; #8220;We have known this from pretty much the day after he got the injury and after the successful surgery, we were sure of it. I hope everyone treats this information responsibly. There has been no change, no setback  #8211; it #8217;s exactly on the schedule we expected and planned for.

If we do see him back this season it will be a bonus. #8221;  gt;  gt;The decision to provide further detail on Oxlade-Chamberlain #8217;s recovery at this time was made with a view to alleviating any unrealistic pressure on a return date for the No.21.  gt;  gt;Klopp, the club and the player himself are in total agreement on ensuring his rehabilitation is right rather than rushed, with the future firmly in mind.  gt;  gt; #8220;It is so important  #8211; because of how valuable and important he is to what we are looking to do here in the coming seasons  #8211; that the focus is on doing this right and not rushed.

    <TITLE>Finding a number 10</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-07-19 12:54:50</DATE>
    <TEXT>So some of our tier 1 journalists seem to believe that we are not going back in for Fekir, whether that is true or not we really can't tell considering A) It could be a smokescreen B) They might not have a clue, as our club is very secretive now Say we aren't back in for Fekir, we will all be very sad yes but let's try and find alternatives, I'll give 2 examples below and any others you think of write in the comments. 1: **Bruno Fernandes, 23 years old** \- Almost always the focal point of the attack at his clubs, the attack always seems to start with him being the distributor. He is very intelligent and has great positioning, and like what we had in Coutinho, he is great at long-shots. 11 goals 8 assists in 33 games last season, however like he did in the world cup he can easily be invisible throughout entire games 2: **Julian Brandt, 22 years old** \- I've seen lots of our fans mention him as a Fekir alternative. He is naturally a left winger, but is pretty versatile and can play central roles however i think if we did sign him he would go on the left and Mane would move into that central role he played towards the end of the season. Brandt is known for his ability to cut inside from the left and use his stronger right foot to play that final pass in the attacking third or have a shot on goal. He is 6ft1, so having this height and speed combo can prove to be great if he is on form. In my opinion he was quality at the world cup, whenever he came on he made an impact and I wouldn't have questioned it if he was a starter</TEXT>

Of course he looks a talent as shown in Silva's reign at Watford so maybe they're hoping he can bring the best out of him at Everton too. I do agree however that as he is so young and looks promising they'll probably be able to get their money back for him soon in this market</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Article by James Pearce  gt;Marko Grujic admits he would rather go out on loan than spend this season warming the bench at Liverpool.  gt;  gt;The young Serbian midfielder enjoyed a successful stint at Cardiff City last term and another temporary switch is on the cards.  gt;  gt;Bluebirds boss Neil Warnock is keen to secure his services once again but Grujic, who impressed in the Reds' 2-1 win over Manchester City in New Jersey, is in no rush to make a decision on his short-term future.  gt;  gt; #8220;I will speak about my situation with the manager and Michael (Edwards) over the next few weeks, #8221; Grujic told the ECHO.  gt;  gt; #8220;I am now a Liverpool player and I want to show the best of me to Jurgen (Klopp).  gt;  gt; #8220;After this tour we have a training camp in France. I will try to show my best and then we will see what happens.  gt;  gt; #8220;Everyone knows we bought two new midfielders, two great players and great guys. There are a lot of players in my position so we will see what happens in the next few weeks.  gt;  gt; #8220;Of course I would rather go somewhere to play rather than just stay here and sit on the bench and only play for the under-23s.  gt;  gt; #8220;It's the decision of the club and what they decide is best for me I'll go along with. #8221;  gt;Lazio have been keen to buy  #163;20million rated Grujic but Liverpool would rather he pens a contract extension before being loaned out again.  gt;  gt;The 22-year-old made 14 appearances for Cardiff in the second half of last season as he helped them win promotion to the Premier League.  gt;  gt; #8220;Training is good but for young players the most important thing is game time, #8221; he added.  gt;  gt; #8220;I was very happy to play as much as I did for Cardiff. I felt really good. I played a lot of games and helped the team to win promotion. #8221;  gt;  gt;Grujic came off the bench for the final half hour against Man City in New Jersey as goals from Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane secured victory for Klopp's side.  gt;  gt;  gt;  gt; #8220;It was a nice game. The lads played well in the first half and had a few chances, #8221; Grujic said.  gt;  gt; #8220;It was good to come on in the second half. I've only been back training for a few days. This is just the beginning and I felt good.  gt;  gt; #8220;Mo could only have been on the pitch for 30 seconds before he scored. Sadio could have scored a few more goals but in the end we were happy with the result. #8221;  gt;  gt;The squad fly on to Michigan on Thursday to prepare for Saturday's final tour game against Manchester United.  gt;  gt; #8220;It's always very interesting when we play against United. I'm really looking forward to it, #8221; Grujic said.  gt;  gt; #8220;It might only be a friendly game but we still want to beat them."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not guaranteed starters, Sturridge is fighting for that number 10 role behind firmino too  amp; obviously looks quality as he always does when fit, trouble is he's never fit. Avoid. Shaqiri may be played behind the front 3 and just infront of Keita, but again he's nowhere near to being nailed. Most likely Henderson is the 3rd midfielder alongside Keita  amp; Fabinho, but Shaq might fill in for the first few games depending on how quickly Klopp wants to bring Hendo back in the team after the world cup.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It is news mate, Sturridge has been told by Klopp that he wants him to learn the number 10 role. Ox is out for the season, Sturridge can fill that gap there if he plays well enough, hence klopp saying he will be up for taking sturridge on individual training sessions. I know firmino is irreplaceable in the starting 11, he's Klopp's favourite and the first name on the team sheet. That wasn't what I was saying.</TEXT>

Sturridge is in his plans for this season, he's blocked all offers for him and has been training him to fill in a new role. You say its just media talk, no its not its the official club representatives (James Pearce, Melissa Reddy) stating all of this. If he can stay fit then he is absolute class, and Klopp knows that which is why he will be getting game time this year.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Article by James Pearce  gt;Liverpool have received a boost with the news that Naby Keita should be fit for Saturday's friendly with Napoli in Dublin.  gt;  gt;The Guinea international missed the final two games of the Reds' pre-season tour of America due to a neck injury.  gt;  gt;However, Keita has responded well to treatment and was involved in a specially tailored early morning session at the club's training camp in France on Wednesday.  gt;  gt;Liverpool won't take any risks with the  #163;52.75million signing, but the hope is that he will be available to face the Serie A outfit.  gt;  gt;Nathaniel Clyne should also return to action against Napoli after returning home early from the tour of America following the birth of his son.  gt;  gt;The Reds will fly directly to Dublin on Saturday after their five-day stay in Evian. It's their penultimate friendly before the start of the new Premier League campaign.  gt;  gt;Trent Alexander-Arnold joined his team-mates for the 1km bike ride from the team hotel to the Camille Fournier Stadium for training on Wednesday morning.  gt;  gt;It marked the start of pre-season for the teenager, who reported back on Tuesday evening after his extended break following the World Cup.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Avoid. Big big avoid, at least until the first 5/6 weeks have gone and we see for definite what the system is. As of right now, our midfield is almost certainly going to be Fabinho as the DM, Henderson box-to-box like he was so effectively in 2013/14 with Keita as the more advanced midfielder, and then the obvious front three. Shaqiri was bought as depth to our front three incase any are unavailable, and could play a number 10 role but the issue is with our main starting 11 we don't play with a number 10. Klopp likes him though, and i can see him starting quite a few games but he will always be rotated and is most likely to come off the bench in the majority of games</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah hendo wont play the first game, but after that the midfield trio of Fabinho just behind Henderson and Keita will be the nailed on starting mids. Lallana/Milner/Wijnaldum/Shaqiri might fill in for the first game (most likely Milner). Yes shaqiri might come off the bench and score/assist but thats a massive risk, i'd take Keita at 7.5 over him any day as he is our most nailed on midfielder and if youve watched pre-season then you'd see how involved he is in all the attacks</TEXT>

An injury to any of our front three, VVD or Keita and we are really struggling. Would you seriously be happy with not signing a new midfielder/attacker this window? Don't get me wrong this transfer window has been incredible but it just seems way too risky without 1 more player.

    <TEXT>Firmino is back, started today in the 5-0 win v Napoli. Guaranteed to play against West ham in the opening game 100% unless he gets injured. Would recommend him in your team if you dont have both Salah  amp; Mane. 9.5 is a bargain for bobby. Shaqiri is there for squad depth, at current he is only a depth player and so isnt just a rotation risk he is a rotation player which is a big avoid for FPL. Maybe in the future he can cement his place in the team but not yet. Mane is the best option beside Salah imo, looks on the form of his life and will be involved in most things, arrival of Keita will only help him even more. He #8217;s due a massive goals amp;assist season im predicting. Keita could be an absolute steal at 7.5, many people are overlooking him based on his position but in fact he will be the most attacking midfielder we have and the majority of the attacks will be through him, we #8217;ve seen so often in pre-season him spraying balls into players for 1 on 1 #8217;s atleast 4 times a game, that will be replicated in the premier league as that is the role Klopp has given him in this system. I havent got him in my team yet as i have Salah, Mane  amp; Robertson but will definitely be watching out for him to switch with one of them Sturridge is a massive avoid right now, will get lots of minutes off the bench but not as a starter so i would definitely look elsewhere at the moment, better options at 6m for a 3rd striker and it also uses up a liverpool spot. But if he finds a way into being a regular starter then we all know what danny is like on top form and 6m would be a bargain</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Things like that are really just guessing games as it hasnt happened before, you could say a few things like maybe after 70odd minutes klopp may do a straight swap of firmino - gt; sturridge, or if Mane/Salah are looking tired they could come off for him and bobby goes out to LW like he did last season. Or sturridge can come in as a number 10 and replace a midfielder if we need a goal, as klopp has taken him on some individual training sessions to convert him into a number 10 as he tries to fit him into the team as effectively as possible. Another thing to remember though is that there is the EPL, League Cup, FA cup  amp; Champions league this season so there will be a lot of times where salah/mane/firmino/keita will be rested if there is a game midweek, so sturridge/shaqiri/wijnaldum can get some starts in that way.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I agree with Hazard under Sarri, should be phenomenal. But going without Salah is way too risky imo, Mane and firmino might cover it but its still a massive risk. KDB is just about assists, you dont choose him for the goals but you get a lot of assists, however it doesnt justify the price on him for me and i would much rather Hazard or Mane.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If you have no other places to sacrifice to get a better forward who is more likely to play like 5.5 for Jimenez or 6 for barnes/6.5 for king etc. Then yes its not a bad choice if youre playing 2 strikers anyway and have some sort of cover on the bench if any of your team doesnt play.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Invest more in defense than you have. This season defense looks to be the priority and you have 1 premium defender only. I'd downgrade Cairney to Masuaku/Chalobah and use that 0.5 to upgrade Lowton (who will be tired from europa league anyway) to Bellerin. The 7m forward is personal preference but tosun is the worst of the 3 imo. Sanchez is risky under Mourinho, id downgrade to Mane and use the 1m for your defense</TEXT>

    <TEXT>People who use Mobile reddit  amp; The new reddit layout take up the majority of people on this sub. Flairs dont show up on the new reddit layout or on mobile, so the rank flairs that were given out are more or less useless. When using the RMT thread, you dont know who #8217;s giving you advice, it could be someone who finished 5,000,000th or someone in the top 100. Now getting to the point. Just like the reputation system, can the mods add the rank next to where the reputation is shown? (as in using the same format, so instead of a flair its just text saying the rank) Would make it much more useful in my opinion as then everyone can see it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>But if you read the names instead of skipping over it, it does. An example of why that's important is the wingers, we dont have much winger depth however if i put Shaqiri as the next in line for right-winger, then Lallana would be the next in line for left winger and thats not how it would actually be, because Shaqiri would be the depth for both wings and Lallana would only come on in that position if Shaqiri was injured.</TEXT>

I copied the tweet, but it came out like this "  #128247;[**OptaJoe**](https://twitter.com/OptaJoe)[@OptaJoe](https://twitter.com/OptaJoe) 90 - Everton have received more red cards than any other team in Premier League history. Mist." so i deleted the first part, and obviously accidentally cut out the "90 -" too.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Right, this may well just actually be a prediction. But last year this account also leaked the lineup along with Anfield Express. When they posted this photo originally, they deleted it after about 3 or 4 minutes after being faced with comments saying theyre dickheads for leaking the lineup etc. They then reuploaded the photo whilst saying  #8220;Happy with this side reds? This is just a prediction #8221; Now, as Anfield Express has been banned from twitter, maybe theyre being cautious about it so they don #8217;t get banned like they did.

Making a joke about it after danny ward left doesn #8217;t confirm that he leaked the lineups, it was just a bit of a laugh and yes it might well be true but thats highly unlikely he did that as its completely putting his entire career on the line, i dont buy it and its most certainly not confirmed</TEXT>
