    <TITLE>These 61 Senators are refusing to meet with their constituents before the critical Jan 24 vote on PIPA/SOPA.  #160;Oh Reddit, can you call them?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2012-01-12 18:11:12</DATE>
    <TEXT>The January 24th Senate vote is our best chance to stop SOPA. The EFF, Public Knowledge, Demand Progress, CDT, and anti-SOPA lobbyists all agree on this. So together we've been organizing meetings with Senators in their home districts. The Senate's in recess until the 23rd, so it's the perfect opportunity for a) a local show of force and b) *actually convincing* Senators that these bills are flawed. Here's the problem: the following Senate offices are ignoring our requests for meetings before the 24th. It's not just that the senators are busy; we're asking for meetings with staffers too. Redditors! Can you call the offices below and ask them to meet with us? Even if your state isn't on this list, calls are helpful. It's fine (and encouraged!) to call the entire list. Be polite, but insist that the senator or staff members meet with concerned constituents. FOR YOUR STATE: Introduce yourself, say you oppose SOPA and PIPA, insist that the senator or her staff meet with constituents during the recess, before the cloture vote on the 24th (FYI, "cloture" is a motion to limit debate and push PIPA to a vote, clearing the way for SOPA). Urge the senator to vote against cloture on the 24th, and ask for a meeting to explain your opposition. If they give you a meeting or any useful information, report it on the thread for your state. NOTE: there's some chance they've already granted meetings to individuals who aren't part of our process, so again be polite. But in most cases, these offices are ignoring us. **UPDATE:** We're getting their attention! KEEP IT UP!

    <TEXT>We've been working intensely on this since August, closely with the DC public interest orgs that have been in this game forever. They're saying the same thing MPAA's Chris Dodd told the Times today: none of this was supposed to happen, PIPA was supposed to be a slam dunk. You're right, they're probably going to come back with: 1) Censorship of search engines and information location tools 2) Some ambiguous definition of "information location tools" that would still cover blogs, Reddit, Twitter. 3) Private right of action to cut any site off from Paypal, advertisers, etc. And they'll pitch it as a compromise. But when they do, the internet will be ready. Plus their clock is running out. This is an election year, and as we get into April it's very unlikely for Congress to pass something big, let alone something toxic like SOPA/PIPA. Every week they push this back, they're more likely to lose. There's a moment for cynicism and a moment for celebration. This is one for celebration. You can be circumspect (or even paranoid!) and still celebrate like crazy when you win. And you've got to: the taste of victory calibrates your instincts and makes you want it even more. Monday, back on our grind. Today: Ewoks around a bonfire.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>IAmA co-founder of Fight for the Future. We organized the first anti-SOPA protest in November and nurtured it into this month's epic protest. AMA</TITLE>
    <DATE>2012-01-30 19:33:14</DATE>
    <TEXT>The victory against SOPA belongs to everyone, Reddit and Wikipedia users especially. But the blackout was also the product of deliberate steps by individuals, especially in the early stages. My recently-launched organization Fight for the Future was behind a lot of it. We organized the November 16 "American Censorship Day" protest and got the first round of big sites (including Reddit) to take part. In organizing that first protest, we came up with the "censor your site, drive contacts to Congress" format that ended up kicking so much ass. We also reached out to Wikipedia with a village pump post in early November, which may have got the boulder rolling there. I wanted to do an AMA for a few reasons. First, the idea that a shitstorm of last Wednesday's dimensions can be broken down into a few concrete first steps seems like the kind of dangerous information you want everyone to have. Second, I think there are lots of behind-the-scenes details that'll be interesting to Redditors. The last reason is simple and self-interested: [we're hiring](http://subject3881.org/) :) I'm not sure what the requirements are for verification and maybe this is overkill, but here are some links to stuff we've done and articles about it: [1](http://www.startribune.com/politics/blogs/132782298.html) [2](http://freebieber.org/) [3](http://subject3881.org/pipa) [4](http://americancensorship.org) [5](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/m7zan/the_mpaa_will_soon_be_able_to_block_americans) [6](http://americancensorship.org/infographic2.html) [7](http://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffbercovici/2011/11/16/silicon-valley-vs-hollywood-in-battle-over-piracy) [8](http://my.americancensorship.org) [9](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/oe3mf/these_61_senators_are_refusing_to_meet_with_their) [10](http://sopastrike.com) [11](http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/g/a/2012/01/19/businessinsiderlargest-protest-in-h.DTL) [12](http://articles.boston.com/2012-01-26/metro/30667660_1_wikipedia-editors-advocacy-groups-tiffiniy-cheng)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well, I think the key was that nearly *every* online action we did had key political actors as its target. Members of Congress were getting emails, their phonelines were ringing off the hook, and actual voters in their districts were pestering their staff for in-person meetings. And meanwhile Reddit was raising money for opposing candidates, and fielding challengers. So, we were entering their world in a big way. That combined with the open ended threat of the biggest websites in the world turning even more voters against them in an election year was what tipped it. To sum up, I think online protests will get better at finding specific targets (e.g. politicians), finding their buttons (e.g. constituent opposition, money), and organizing people to hammer on those buttons. As that happens, many of them will really work-- and that will give online protests credibility.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well, not everything's going to be as huge as this month, but we'll be focused on how to make as big an issue as possible out of *any* threat. Also, I think a huge part of this is just changing the way people think about copyright, user freedom, and tech policy. And you can do that in the complete absence of any specific threat if you're creative and nimble enough by making issues out of things that would otherwise slip by unnoticed or inventing new issues/messages from scratch.</TEXT>

Here's the deal: CISPA is now tucked inside of Senate bill S.2105, which has bipartisan congressional support, is being actively supported by the Obama Admin., and is scheduled for a vote in early June. It's alive and well, and on a clear path to becoming law. The Senate goes on recess next week, which means we have exactly 3 days to make calls before they leave for a week and then come back for the vote. The most important thing we can do with that time is to try to get meetings scheduled with our senators while they are in their home states over the recess. This is a proven grassroots strategy that was key to killing SOPA. We can beat CISPA if we do this. **Reddit, we *really* need your help this time. We can't email our supporters about this because of an ongoing deliverability issue with our system, so we're counting on our friends and allies to spread this in other ways.** Here's the site we put together -- use it to call your senators and request a meeting :: **[Privacy Is Awesome.](http://privacyisawesome.com)** Good guy Sen. Wyden said yesterday that this bill would create a "cyber industrial complex [...] that profits from fear and whose currency is Americans' private data." He's right, and our best shot at stopping it from becoming law is getting this strategy spread out far and wide right now. # # # *Update* # # # First of all, thanks so much for all the support! You guys are doing an AWESOME job contacting your Congresspeople about CISPA, and more importantly, you're helping to spread the word. **We would love it if you could leave a comment in this thread detailing how your conversation went after calling or visiting your Congresspeople's office.** It'll help us know who is for the bill, who is against the bill, and which tactics are making a difference. With everyone's help, we're confident that this thing can be beaten. Let's work to keep The Internet safe for another day! # # # *Update 2* # # # [We started a thread for report backs and further organizing and calls. You can talk to everyone here too. We're going through all these comments and will post any events on the new page.](http://www.reddit.com/r/CISPA/comments/u2u2m/thread_for_organizing_to_kill_cispa_this_weekend/)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>99 senators haven't come out against CISPA, and they're rushing a vote for as soon as they come back from Memorial Day recess. Today is the last day before they leave. They need to know we're not okay with this.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2012-05-25 18:30:32</DATE>
    <TEXT>Our friends in D.C. are telling us that the Senate vote on S.2105, the Obama-backed bill that contains the CISPA language, is going to happen as soon as they get back from Memorial Day recess. CISPA, in case you've forgotten, is the bill that would nullify all existing privacy laws and give corporations legal immunity for sharing your communications with the government. It would effectively end privacy on the internet. Today is our last chance to call and request meetings with our senators' staffs before they go into recess mode. These 99 senators need more calls (took Wyden off the list because he is [amazing](http://www.wyden.senate.gov/news/blog/post/wyden-on-cyber-security-privacy-should-be-the-default-not-the-exception)). Can you call your senators and politely ask to meet with them or their staff about CISPA over the Memorial Day recess? Let us know how it goes in the comments.

    <TEXT>From what we're hearing, this looks like it could pass the Senate simply based on ignorance. That's why Thursday and Friday, while the Senate is on recess, we're asking people to drop in at their senators' local offices and share our CISPA one-pager with them :: http://www.privacyisawesome.com/#dropin If you can't drop in, print it and send it in the mail to D.C. along with a personal note (addresses [here](http://www.senate.gov/general/contact_information/senators_cfm.cfm)). Drop-ins and snail mail are not as easy as filling out a webform, but they are the most effective ways of communicating with your representatives in Congress. If you can do either of these things, you'll be a hero. Let us know in the comments how/if you can help out.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>The Senate is about to take up CISPA. FFTF has lined up meetings w/ Senators offices in TX, TN, MD, WI, IA  amp; MT starting tomorrow, and we need some Redditors to attend, taking a stand for online privacy. Can you?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2012-07-09 18:04:03</DATE>
    <TEXT>The CISPA-esque Cybersecurity legislation that would end all privacy in The Internet in the Senate might have dropped off the radar, but is still very alive. Before Congress #8217; most recent break, two bills were battling for support on the Senate Floor. The first, sponsored by Joe Lieberman, is called The Cybersecurity Act of 2012 (s.2105). The second, sponsored by John McCain, is called the SECURE IT Act (s.2151). Support for the bills was split along party lines, and neither had secured enough support to bring either bill to a vote. Right before the break began, Senator McCain re-introduced the SECURE IT Act as s.3342, which claimed to address both the partisan concerns of the Democratic party, and the privacy concerns raised by organizations like us. Spoiler alert: our privacy concerns have not been addressed. Senator Harry Reid is eager to bring CISPA-esque legislation to a vote (http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/senate/232227-reid-says-senate-will-soon-take-up-cybersecurity-bill) and if this revamped SECURE IT address the Democrat #8217;s concerns, then we don #8217;t have much time. Brace yourselves... a vote on SECURE IT is coming. Back in June, Redditors helped to stall the bill this far into July by making calls and setting up meetings. The most important part of the strategy to kill CISPA and the most effective way to get a Senator to take our concerns seriously is an in person meeting with one of their staff members. So, we #8217;ve set up 8 meetings in 7 states that we want Redditors to attend. Check out the list below, and if you see a meeting that you can attend please send an e-mail to FFTFmeetings@gmail.com with your name and the meeting you'd like to attend (this is a security precaution all Senator's offices take) Meetings: WI - Milwaukee - 7/12 @ 1pm meeting w/ Ron Johnson #8217;s regional director. MD - Baltimore - 7/12 @ 1pm meeting w/ Ben Cardin #8217;s regional director MT - Missoula - 7/13 @ 1pm, meeting w/ Max Baccus #8217;s regional director TN - Nashville - 7/10 @ 1pm, meeting w/ Lamar Alexander #8217;s field representative. IA - Des Moines - 7/10 @ 3:30pm, meeting w/ Chuck Grassley (co-sponsor of the SECURE IT Act) TX - Austin - 7/10 @ 10am, meeting w/ John Cornyn #8217;s staff. TX - Houston - 7/13 @ 1pm, meeting w/ John Cornyn #8217;s staff.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Both Senator Feinstein (a co-signer of The Cybersecurity Act of 2012) and Senator Boxer have been HORRIBLE at responding to constituents requests for meetings. We've submitted several requests online in regards to both CISPA and SOPA, and never heard back. The best thing you can do is visit either of their websites, find the office nearest to you (most Senators keep at least 2 or 3 offices in a State, I know that Feinstein has 1 office in each major city in CA), and drop in randomly. Bring one of our one-sheeters (http://www.privacyisawesome.com/cispa-drop-in-fftf.pdf) and leave it with their staff. Make sure they take down your name. Get your friends to do the same. Encourage everyone you know to stop by there, and if you can, do it multiple times a week. They have to report these visits up the chain, and if enough of their constituents make a stink about the issue, they will have to address it at some point. Make sure to be polite to the staff. Always be polite to the staff, you're angry at their boss' policies, not them. **tl;dr - calls/letter to Feinstein and Boxer are great, but drop-ins are the best since they won't meet with us, but be polite to the staffers you meet**</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The fight against CISPA actually has nothing to do with Piracy. Essentially, CISPA grants private corporations immunity from certain security investigations if they willfully submit non-anonymized user data to either the NSA or DHS (depending on which bill is supported). This data includes your personal communications. Additionally, all communications submitted to the government can be used retroactively against you in non-cybersecurity investigations. Oh, also, it costs tax-payers $15 million over 4 years. tl;dr - the Government will have all your online communications for "cybersecurity" but can use them to prosecute your for non-cybersecurity related offenses and they're making you pay for it.</TEXT>

If you can't go on Thursday, or are too far away from Milwaukee, I would encourage you to check the websites for either of your Senators (Ron Johnson  amp; Herb Kohl) and call the closest office to schedule a meeting (generally, this is really easy and the people working in the office are very friendly). If you schedule your own meeting (which would be AWESOME), send an e-mail to FFTFmeetings@gmail.com, give us the details, and we'll try and help you find someone else to go with.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>+1, upvote, like, A+++++ summary of talking points fast shipping would read again, etc. Seriously, this is a wonderfully compact and accurate set of deep and complex talking points. It's worth noting that Cardin was the only Democrat to revoke his co-sponsorship of PIPA before the January 18th protests. Although he didn't release many statements regarding his decision, it seemed that pointing out the dangers to DNSSEC was quite persuasive. **At the same time** please keep in mind that you should have a lot of this stuff printed out so that it can be passed up to the proper legislative aide in DC (and yes, if you leave it with them, it will get passed up the chain). You will be meeting with a regional director who mostly cares about local constituent services, and probably knows NOTHING about the intricacies of CISPA-esque Cybersecurity legislation. So while you should absolutely come prepared, you should know that some of this might fall on ignorant ears.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>We've found that in person meetings at the state level tend to be given more weight than a phone call or e-mail. We've funneled calls and e-mails, no one has listened, so we'd like to get a large number of people meeting with state staff. Regional Directors will pass your opinions up the chain. They will definitely forward any literature left with them at these meetings. That's why printing out a 1-sheeter and leaving it with the staff is imperative. If you're in DC, we'd love to have you schedule a meeting with a legislative assistant, but since most posters aren't in DC, this is the best we can do.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's voluntary at the company level. Users have no say in the issue, and its their data being shared. Additionally, there are significant issues with HOW the data can be used by the Government once it is shared. For instance, the current version of SECURE IT allows data collected via sharing to be used retroactively as evidence of non cybersecurity related crimes. So, if the Government suspects that you're doing something illegal that is not cybersecurity related, they can use that data collected as evidence against in court w/o needing to subpoena the you or the site.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Very important vote on Cybersecurity Act of 2012 (US Senate's CISPA) today. If we kill it with fire, CISPA dies with it. Here are some resources you can use!</TITLE>
    <DATE>2012-08-02 17:50:26</DATE>
    <TEXT>**EDIT: Victory (for now)!!!** Right after writing this post, the vote to invoke cloture failed 52-46 (60 ayes required to invoke Cloture). Proof that 3 days of constant calling, writing, and tweeting can make a difference! This effectively kills the bill.. for now. The Senate is about to into the August recess. The vote for Cloture is notable because Harry Reid (a fiarly staunch supporter of s.2105) joined the nays. It's unlikely that he was swayed by his constituents to change his stance... instead, he probably hopes to continue talks over the bill to develop a version that is acceptable to both Republicans and Democrats. We're cautiously declaring victory... this Congress has been pretty terrible at coming to a bi-partisan consensus on issues, but entirely possible that we will hear about this bill in September. **tl;dr** - victory against CISPA for now, but keep your ear to the ground come September. **--Original Post--** Later today the Senate will vote to invoke cloture on debate about S.2105 - The Cybersecruity Act of 2012 (this was initially schedule for 10am, then pushed back to 11am, still hasen't happened at 11:30am). After this happens, there can only be **30 hours** before a floor vote to pass the bill. Currently, the bill doesn't have a ton of dedicated supporters like SOPA did. This means that lots of Senators can be swayed to vote "no" if enough of their constituents speak up. **If you've called before, call again.** **If you've haven't called yet, call now.** **If you haven't told your friends, spread the word.** Seriously, we need people to call call call. Over the past 2 days, aides have told us that Cybersecurity Act is the bill they've heard the most about, and that its making some Senator's re-think their positions. Most offices won't take your name, but they do keep "yay" or "nay" tallies that get reported to the Senators on the floor in real time. We can kill this bill!!! The Internet can rack up 3 victories in 2012 (SOPA/PIPA, ACTA, and now CISPA) which is absolutely unheard of!

    <TEXT>We totally agree. And unfortunately, these attacks will probably continue even if we are able to get comprehensive laws that protect our rights. The Fourth Amendment was supposed to protect us, but has been eroded by bad policy. It's important that the movement is proactive in agitating for good legislation that protects our online rights, but perhaps even more important that we're proactive about getting organized and making sure we can sound the alarm when something bad happens. One thing we've built to try to help with that is the Internet Defense League. We're doing an action tomorrow on CISPA. You can learn more here: http://www.internetdefenseleague.org</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is a great question, and one that's at the heart of what we work on every day. Tech policy issues are often somewhat complex at the legislative level -- the trick is putting things in language that feels real and visceral to people. Most people aren't going to get riled up by a website with the headline "Reform ECPA now" but would definitely want to read a site entitled "The government wants toread your email without a warrant."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So the only thing about those Whitehouse.gov petitions is that they are a onetime shot. If you get 100,000 you get a response from Obama, which may or may not be helpful to the cause. And then that's it. You can't contact the people who took action to build a movement or give updates on what's coming next. Also, the privacy policy is a bit concerning. Better to take action on a site from one of the many great advocacy groups that are out there. That said, every tactic has a time and a place. If there's an issue that a statement from Obama could make a huge difference on, by all means, go for it.</TEXT>

A company could share a massive dump of user data for cybersecurity reasons, and then that information could be used for marketing research with no oversight.</TITLE>

    <TEXT>Here are some of the main concerns that remain with CISPA: -It allows corporations to share your private data with the government in ways that are currently illegal. It does not require those corporations to strip personally identifiable information from that data before sharing, and it allows it to be shared directly with military agencies like the NSA that have essentially zero oversight. -It gives companies complete legal immunity when they share your data, so you can't sue them even if you can prove that they shared your data illegally and without cause. -It contains a FOIA exemption, meaning that you can't submit a request to find out if your data was shared illegally. So most people will never know that their data was shared.

    <TEXT>Get creative! The markup tomorrow will be held behind closed doors. Maybe there needs to be a protest outside? If you work for a tech company, try to get them to come out against CISPA and support their users privacy. Have connections to the labor movement or other institutions? Talk to them about privacy and how it impacts all grassroots movements. Got a little extra cash or bitcoins? Donate them to an organization that is fighting. But truly, spreading the word on social media is one of the most important things you can do. Congress is still a little skittish after SOPA. They know that if everyone finds out what CISPA is really about they will have an uprising on their hands. Make sure everyone knows.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think this is actually an extremely important question. Thanks for asking. Privacy is essential for democracy. It's not just "criminals" who should be worried about keeping their email safe, it's all of us. We need to feel free to express ourselves without wondering if someone is watching. That's essential to the democratic process. When the government is able to collect massive amounts of data on its citizens, the potential for abuse of that information is frightening. History has shown time and again that the government has used surveillance to target specific populations (completely innocent Japanese Americans during World War II, for example, or Muslims post 9-11.) Thanks to outdated privacy laws, the government claims that they can read your email, text messages, facebook chats, dropbox contents, etc. without a warrant. And when I say "the government," it's not hyperbole, there are literally 603 government agencies that have access to the subpoena's necessary to get this data. (Source: https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/03/under-cispa-who-can-get-your-data). It's not just criminal activity that we want to keep to ourselves. What about your health information? Info about what you buy and what shows (or porn) you watch? Your STD status? That argument you had with your lover? All of those things could end up in the wrong hands. They could be leaked to the media, to your boss, to your mom. CISPA not only allows sharing from corporations to the government but also the other way around. As it's currently written, there's nothing that stops a company that receives a massive dump of data under CISPA from using that data for marketing research or to advertise directly to you. That's sketchy, and it's wrong. The Fourth Amendment is a cornerstone of our democratic society. CISPA breaks it fundamentally. Warrant requirements are important to ensure that law enforcement only invades our privacy if they have reason to believe we've done something wrong. Without that barrier, we end up in a society that I think most of us would rather not live in.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>On the contrary, we've noticed that CISPA is pissing people off -- not quite on the scale that SOPA did. The other thing that's important to note is that the big tech companies like Google and Facebook haven't jumped into the fight against CISPA the way the did against SOPA. that's because they actually stand to benefit from this bill as it gives them legal immunity for sharing our information. We have to win this as a grassroots fight, since we don't have the tech giants at our backs.</TEXT>

FACT: Cameron #8217;s sister appeared in the courtroom to support him and has been extremely outspoken in calling for Cam #8217;s release. She characterizes the incident between them as a  #8220;normal fight between a brother and sister #8221; and says she only called the police to get back at her little brother, not because she ever felt threatened by him. Her written Victim Impact Statement, which was on the record before Cameron #8217;s arrest, directly contradicts the Police Report that the prosecution has been using as evidence and has been widely disseminated in the media. Cam #8217;s sister is outraged that this incident has been used to hold her little brother in jail when he should be home with his family. She is prepared to testify on his behalf and is actively working with free speech groups and Cam #8217;s attorney on his defense.</TEXT>

This is from a friend, Matt Wood, who's on the DC team at Free Press: "Hill offices definitely are open during recess, when members are out of DC but staffs are still on duty. With the holiday on Thursday, there's a chance they will be closed or lightly staffed not just on the 4th, but also the 3rd and/or 5th as well. So the earlier that week the better for calls, most likely. On Monday the 1st and Tuesday the 2nd." Tuesday's a better day for a launch. It will give larger sites one workday to get their ducks in a row for a big push. Then, the cool thing is that members of Congress will be in their home districts. We can request to meet with them over the recess and post the dates and times (that could happen here on a Reddit thread) then drive people to those meetings as a secondary ask after they email or call Congress. For members of Congress that support us on the issue, we can plan local events with them as they make appearances at municipal fourth of July celebrations. For members of Congress on the wrong side, we can protest any public appearances they make over the holiday weekend. Either way, a July 2nd launch lets you link an online protest to the holiday, but also bury Congress in phonecalls without just going to voicemail in empty offices. One idea (which maybe has come up already, sorry for not following more closely) participating sites could run the fourth amendment on their front page for a day, with an ask to call Congress and sign up for in-district meetings / local protests.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So, this number connects you directly to Congress once you enter a zipcode. It connects you to your two senators and then your representative without having to start a new call. And it gives everyone a clear, concise thing to ask for, based on the letter from EFF  amp; [stopwatching.us](http://stopwatching.us) The cool thing about a phone number is you can use it anywhere: in an image, a flyer, a banner, a billboard, a radio ad, on stage at an event, etc. It let's you turn anyone in earshot into another activist. Our hope is that folks on /r/restorethefourth can use it everywhere, especially in flyers and images for sharing. Phone calls are one of the *most* effective ways to pressure Congress, second only to in-person meetings. The deluge of phone calls was what killed SOPA  amp; PIPA; Congressional staffers will tell you this. We're about to send it out to our list and pass it along to allies in the [stopwatching.us](http://stopwatching.us) coalition. But it would be great if you all could test it now to make sure there are no issues, to make sure the data it's using is correct and the numbers all work, etc. Thanks! And one of us will be on tonights' IRC meeting. --Holmes from [Fight for the Future](http://subject3881.org)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Meeting with your member of Congress or joining a huge protest is great too. And if you're a software engineer, supporting work on encryption projects is a big way to help. There's so much work there to be done... I mean even sending an encrypted email is still such a pain (although OTR chat in Pidgin/Adium is great). But I should say that you really shouldn't live like you have anything to fear. The chances of people who very successfully take a stand on this being spied on exists, but the chances of them targeting and really coming after anyone working on this is very small-- mostly because it could easily backfire if discovered.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think people aren't talking enough about what it means that several thousand (or more) employees and contractors for the NSA and FBI can access literally any person or organization's closely held secrets. I mean, that is a ton of power. What couldn't you do with it? Flip a presidential election. Dramatically manipulate the stock market value of a company. Destroy the career of a pretty good percentage of public figures over affairs, embarrassing fetishes, or minor past indiscretions. And there are thousands of people with access to this at their desk, not to mention all the sysadmins like Snowden who clearly had access to more than anyone realized or really thought about. Not to mention the fact that PRISM-- or a system like it-- was hacked by the Chinese a few years back, as reported in the Washington Post. So there's the potential for completely unauthorized access as well.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>VPNs are great! However, VPNs won't keep your email or chats safe, since those go through other services. People should use Adium/Pidgin with OTR encryption for chats. It's the easiest-to-use encrypted communication tool around, and you can use it over gtalk and facebook chats as well. It won't stop the most determined and well-resourced attackers because they can probably use some zero-day malware and just bug your computer. But encrypted email and chat do offer very strong privacy protection.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is a great question, and it's important that we ask this every time we organize something, rather than just saying "hey I know we'll organize another protest." But a quick look at history shows that we can't say nothing is changing. People have fought tooth and nail for many of the most basic freedoms that we enjoy today, and those freedoms must be constantly defended or things would be way worse than they are right now. The way I see it, there isn't one single solution to NSA spying. It's going to take a massive social movement that the government can't ignore, and also a lot of brilliant technical people figuring out how to beef up encryption and security to make it way harder for agencies like the NSA to spy on everyone en masse. Passing laws that limit the government's ability to spy on people is a good start, but we have to remember that they've broken (or interpreted in absurd ways) the laws that already exist, so the most important thing is to build a dedicated movement of people who are ready and willing to take action to hold the government and the companies that make up the internet accountable when they violate our rights.</TEXT>

Additionally, the U.S. governmnt has a wonderful track record of considering all kinds of people to be "threats to national security" including Martin Luther King Jr., some senators, journalists, and a wide range of nonviolent dissidents: http://www.businessinsider.com/nsa-spying-cold-war-declassified-2013-9 Finally, even if you totally trust the NSA and think they are only going to use this information to stop attacks, what about the individual people who work for them? It's clear that NSA officials are still unclear about what Snowden was able to take, and we know that there have been many incidents in the past where analysts have abused the system to spy on love interests and a variety of other creepy things, and then covered it up.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Rallies, protests, and actions are visible manifestations of growing movements. Besides generating attention from the media and putting a lot of pressure on Congress (who are already well aware that the vast majority of their constituents oppose this mass surveillance), mass mobilizations like this solidify relationships between groups and individuals who then stay in touch and begin to form the fabric of a powerful social movement. Imagine this rally as an essential and powerful kick-off party for an ongoing and sustained campaign by many people worldwide to push back on government surveillance. It's a way to allow many people to express their anger, and then shows millions of others around the world who feel the same way that they are not alone, and they don't have to stand idly by while their rights are trampled.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think this is a valid concern to have, but from everything we've learned from Snowden and other whistleblowers, it's clear that while agencies like the NSA are happy to bend the rules, those rules do make a huge difference in what they do. The more restrictions we can place on government surveillance, the more difficult it will be for them to constantly watch everyone all the time. These agencies are not invincible. We need to push for maximum transparency so that as many people as possible are aware of what they're doing and how. It's hard to imagine that things would be better if we remained silent about this issue than if we continue to make noise about it and do everything in our power to make the NSA's lives harder.</TEXT>

As I've said in response to another question, I can't imagine a scenario where remaining silent on this issue would make us safer than being loud about it. Whatever changes we get will help move things in the right direction, and we can use those victories to continue to bolster the movement. It's important that we build a culture where people are generally antagonistic to the government snooping into their private lives. The more we can do that, the better off we'll be in the long run.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey there! A few things: The bill we're talking about is commonly referred to as "Fast Track." [Here's a link to the text.](http://www.finance.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/TPA%20bill%20text.pdf) The agreement we're talking about, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, is not a bill, it's a massive international trade agreement that involves 12 countries and covers all kinds of things from intellectual property, to environmental and labor protections. Fast Track is a bill in the U.S. that basically asks Congress to give up their right to debate trade agreements, and gives all that authority to the Executive Branch. Once Fast Track is passed, Congress must ratify trade agreements with a simple up or down vote, rather than being able to debate it meaningfully. There are often comparisons made between CISPA, SOPA, and other bills that restrict online freedom and privacy with the TPP. They're definitely different things, but the end result is the same: more censorship, more surveillance, less privacy, and less freedom. See the AMA description for a bunch of great links and resources on both the Fast Track bill and the TPP.</TEXT>

What they're doing IS unconstitutional, as you say, but they're only going to stop if we make them. 2) Regarding getting the Supreme Court involved, unfortunately pro-Fast Track and pro-corporate politicians have done an amazing job spinning Fast Track as if it's not a problem, since Congress is WILLINGLY giving up their right to debate. It's very unlikely the Supreme Court will help us here. If Fast Track passes, the TPP will be quick on its heals.</TEXT>

In the House, [161 Democrats and 27 Republicans](http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2014/01/10/214126/troubles-for-trade-obamas-fast.html) have already publicly stated their opposition to Fast Track. If we push this, we can get the numbers needed to kill the bill. If we stop Fast Track, there's a very good chance the TPP will fall apart, or at least that the worst provisions will be kept out.

EFF has some resources on this here: https://www.eff.org/issues/tpp There are a few things related to privacy in the TPP (at least from what we know so far, there is a lot more of the TPP that the public has NEVER seen.) I think EFF could better explain some of the other provisions, but one that has very clear implications for privacy is a strong push within the TPP to make ISP's responsible for monitoring and censoring copyrighted content. This requires ISP's to violate their customers privacy in order to play the cops of the internet, and could lead to ISPs collecting and logging more data on all of us.</TEXT>

Lone Pine is actually a Canadian-based company, but they were able to use NAFTA to sue Quebec because they're registered in Delaware.

    <TEXT>Yes you're exactly right. There are many groups that oppose Fast Track simply because they feel it is anti-democratic and unconstitutional who don't have a specific position on the TPP. With approval of Congress at a record low, it's hard to believe that they could improve bills. But compared to US trade representatives and corporate advisors deciding issues that affect us all behind closed doors, Congress is the closest thing we have to a governing body accountable to the public. If a dysfunctional Congress is all we have, it's still better than having no say at all. Regardless of your politics, we can all agree that governments racing to enact laws that affect everyone without proper discussion and debate is a bad thing.</TEXT>

The corporate monopolies that pushed for it are always trying to find new and sneaky ways to achieve the same end, but with limited success, thanks to the massive ability of the Internet to get the word out about these threats. Just this past month we've been [successfully beating back](http://stopfasttrack.com) an attempt to "Fast Track" the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a secretive trade agreement that contains SOPA-like copyright provisions. Making meaningful change is not easy. It takes time! But history has shown that when people organize and fight together, we can accomplish things that no one thought was possible.</TEXT>

Thinking to ourselves: who else might see this beyond who I intend? What might happen to me because of that? That split-second of hesitation is an insidious form of censorship. We at FFTF have been on the front lines fighting for free speech online since before SOPA. We don't see privacy as a new issue for us. We can't have free speech without privacy. Without free speech, we have no democracy.</TEXT>

If you don't want the NSA to know that you're against them, you probably shouldn't sign a petition, call your reps, or take any other public form of protest against them. Then again, if you DO want them to know that their days of illegal surveillance are numbered, then be brave and speak out. Activist organizations make all kinds of tools that make it easier to contact your representatives. Feel free to use them or not. But if we all remain silent because we're too afraid to speak out, then we've already lost, and surveillance has done it's job of completely censoring public conversation and dissent. Given that #StopTheNSA is trending on twitter right now, though, I think you'll be in good company if you speak out against the spying today.</TEXT>

The NSA aren't the only game in town -- other governments are spying too, and more will follow soon. We need to protect ourselves with meaningful policy but we also have to start organizing as Internet users to demand technology that protects our privacy. Everyone should be learning about and supporting tech services that offer end to end encryption and other forms of protection. While it's very likely that the Intelligence community will continue to abuse whatever power they have, and stretch the limits of whatever regulations are placed on them -- the strength of those regulations does have a real impact. Anything we can do to make the NSA's life harder: with policy, technology, or direct action, will push us in the right direction and prevent the situation from getting worse.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>First: think about privacy and take it seriously. Don't rely on "I have nothing to hide." The more of us that protect ourselves from dragnet spying the safer we ALL are. Some quick suggestions: For email, use GPG For IM, use an OTR plugin like Adium or Pidgin Everyone should [get a VPN](http://getavpn.org) Try Text Secure for text messaging. Use DuckDuckGo for web search (they're supporting the action today!) There are tons of options out there for protecting yourself -- but the most important first step is to think seriously about your online presence and how to secure it. Even basic things like making sure your passwords are strong and random is a great first step for those of us who haven't been practicing strong security.</TEXT>

The Internet is a good political "death start" and when we can laser-focus it's energy on something we can do some cool stuff. That said, I think overall you are right -- it will take a long and sustained effort to dismantle mass government surveillance and the systems it's entrenched in. A massive online protest like The Day We Fight Back, though, is an incredible way to spread the word and grow the movement.

They are recording intimate details of all of our lives through our Internet use, phone calls, text messages, and more, and storing them in case they ever want to investigate you years down the road. 2) That's bad. It makes people scared to freely express themselves, which makes it impossible to have a real democracy. 3) Today, a whole ton of people are protesting this. We're trying to stop a really bad bill called the "Fisa Improvements Act" that would actually give the NSA *more* power to spy on us, and encouraging congress to pass the USA Freedom Act, which would be a good start to limiting some of the spying. That help?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's good to be skeptical -- we still don't know the full extent of NSA capabilities -- but to the extent that there are many of us who don't want to live completely unplugged, there are definitely concrete steps we can take to make mass spying much more difficult. Can you keep the NSA out if they're looking directly at YOU, probably not, but can you make it WAY harder and more expensive for them to sweep you up into their dragnet? Yep, and it's really not that hard.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is a great question / thought, but here's the thing. The idea is not what can stop the NSA from looking at *Joey*. It's how can we make it WAY harder and more expensive for the NSA to look at EVERYONE and then pick Joey out of the mix based on something he said in an email 5 years ago. Sure, if the NSA wants to hack you, they will. But if everyone starts running a VPN, and apps start using SSL and end to end encryption whenever possible, it makes the dragnet style surveillance on the scale they're doing now impossible.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey, Evan here from Fight for the Future. Disclosure: i'm one of the organizers of [the protest.](https://battleforthenet.com) So starting tonight at midnight EST, thousands of websites (including some of your favorites like reddit, esty, kickstarter, netflix, namecheap, mozilla, imgur, foursquare, vimeo, wordpress, and more) will be displaying prominent messages for their users featuring the so-called "spinning wheel of death," that Loading... symbol that we all hate to see just as Game of Thrones is getting to the good part. The idea is to symbolically show the world what the web could look like if the FCC continues on its current course and allows for "paid prioritization," meaning websites that can afford to pay would be able to reach people at faster speeds than ones that can't. Imagine if you woke up tomorrow and the sites that you're used to going to for news, info, and entertainment were taking FOREVER to load, while you get annoying pop-ups from your ISP suggesting you try out one of their "fast lane approved" news sites. Basically, they want to make the Internet more like what they know best: Cable TV. That would mean, instead of being able to access a diversity of opinion, the net would be full of content that is chosen FOR YOU by a few select corporations, while all the weird, alternative, subcultural, and informative stuff that makes the internet so great is relegated to a "slow lane." There are lots of ways to help. If you have a website, blog, or tumblr, get the code here to run the "slowlane" widget on your site and encourage your visitors to take acton: https://battleforthenet.com/sept10th Everyone else, show your support by changing your profile pic to one of these rad "Loading..." gifs: https://battleforthenet.com/sept10th/#avatar Then, spread the word. We need to make this go even more viral before tomorrow. It's not enough for this protest to be big, it has to be massive if we're going to win. Lots of suggested tweets and graphics to use here: http://tumblr.subject3881.org/post/96550398438/september-10th-internet-slowdown-organizing-materials I think that's it! If other people have ideas, please chime in. The Internet Slowdown is not just about big websites taking a stand, it's about all of us. Thanks, reddit! _Evan at http://subject3881.org</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well, I can't speak for the great work that Free Press and others have been doing for the last many years, but in terms of this recent fight, I think the huge victory is that all of a sudden EVERYONE is talking about Title II reclassificaton, which is the only real path the FCC can take to protect the Internet in the public interest. When we first started fighting several months ago, we had to battle to get attention. No one was talking about Title II, very few companies were speaking out. We camped outside the FCC for 10 days during [Occupy the FCC](http://occupythefcc.org) and bombarded them with millions of emails, petition signatures, and comments. Now, we've got them on the ropes and everyone knows where the public stands. The ball is in the FCC's court. If they choose to ignore the overwhelming public outcry on this, they're exposing themselves as an agency that has no legitimacy and no longer works for the public.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Amanda, you rock, thanks for kicking this off. So here's the deal. The FCC (Federal Communications Commission) is trying to push forward a proposal that would allow Internet Service Providers (ISPs) like Comcast and Verizon to discriminate between different websites when they deliver content to you, and to charge websites a fee for access to a so-called "Fast Lane." If this happens, we'll lose the secret ingredient that has made the Internet so diverse, weird, and revolutionary. The net could become more like mainstream Cable TV, where a few corporations basically get to pick and choose which content gets seen by the most people. Imagine if you went online tomorrow and all of your favorite news sites were "loading..." forever, while Comcast was offering blazing fast speeds to read CNN.com (cuz they cut a deal.) The attack on net neutrality is an attack on our ability to freely express ourselves, communicate, and create online. It's an attack on freedom of speech and freedom of press, and an attack on democracy and human rights. Whatever issues you care about, whatever your passion is, we all know the transformative power of the internet to get our ideas out there. Without the fundamental principle that has made the net a level playing field where everyone has a voice, so many other social movements would suffer. This is truly a fight for the future. Whooh!

And the rules we got don't use *all* the FCC's Title II powers. They just do the minimum to make sure ISPs don't mess with your Internet. No blocking. No throttling. But the short answer to your question is: us! If they started doing that, the same forces that got these net neutrality rules passed (including the reddit community) would band together and stop them.

    <TEXT>My understanding is: the way the law is written, whenever the FCC releases draft rules they have to open up a public comment period, which takes weeks or months. So if they released it before the vote, they'd need to open up another comment period. Then if they made changes and released it again, another comment period  #8211; an infinite loop. Given the law as it stands, there's always one last phase where they have to go heads down and vote on a rule. Yes, that means that nobody outside a tiny number of people at the FCC has read the final version. And yes, it's crazy the law is written this way. That said, there are several people in the community of groups that have been working on this who were in constant conversation with the people drafting these rules and have a good idea of what's in them. That includes Free Press, as well as experts like Barbara van Schewick. So once we got close to the vote, and had good intel that the rules were pretty strong, it would have been crazy to ask them to be released. It would've given Comcast and friends another 8 weeks or maybe more to regroup and figure out a way to block the rules. (And we'd still not be in a position to know exactly what the final rules were until after the vote, due to the problem above.) Next up: bring American regulatory agencies up to modern standards of transparency! Who here wants to work on that? (Gah, not me)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Also, re: the 322 pages of rules, I've heard the actual rules themselves are just a few pages. Things like: "no blocking", "no throttling", etc. The rest is context, legal justification of the rules, stuff like that. All the details matter of course, but it's not really the case that there are 322 pages of mystery rules. Another really sleazy thing that some critics of the FCC (including Commissioner Pai himself) have done here is they've taken aspects the way the FCC has *always* worked (and they know this) and then pretended to be **absolutely shocked** that it's acting this way now. One example of this was the fake outrage at President Obama saying what he thought the FCC should do (many presidents have done this, including Bush, Reagan, Clinton, and Nixon). Another example is this snafu about transparency, or about "322 pages of rules". It's not that the FCC shouldn't be more transparent, but it's sleazy of these guys, who know the process well, to pretend that it doesn't always work this way.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think the difference between the two issues is that it's actually harder to build an argument for eliminating those laws, than it is to build an argument for net neutrality. Many people have a really hard time thinking about such emotionally wrenching topics like war, terrorism, and national security without falling into certain psychological traps. And people in power exploit that. With the Internet, it's something most people understand in a very pragmatic, day-to-day way, since they use it all the time. So the work of convincing and organizing people is easier. This in particular is why I really enjoy working on Internet issues. Plus people come to it with less prejudice and partisan baggage, for the most part (though we're seeing some of that right now).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This isn't a bill though. The power the FCC has is given to it by a bill Congress passed and became law ages ago. And the FCC can't just give itself new powers. For the past 10 years or so, people have been asking the FCC for rules to stop ISPs from screwing with peoples' Internet (because ISPs were starting to do that!) They gave us some rules before, but those were broken. Yesterday, they gave us new rules that we think will hold up better, and will do a better job at achieving their goal than the older rules. That's what happened here. The FCC didn't get "new powers". They had this power already. They were just refusing to use it properly to protect the public, because of pressure from the ISPs.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah but the thing is, the Internet is important, and what's your solution? Sure, we could wait until wireless software defined mesh is awesome, but by that time Comcast has turned the Internet into something a lot more like cable TV, and that sucks. If they'd managed to start that "paid fastlane" crap, every year that went by would've meant irreversible damage to the Internet as a public sphere, to the quality of our news and conversations, and to the degree we were free to speak, be creative, start businesses, revolutions, etc. We had to nip this thing in the bud to keep the Internet awesome. Then the question is, how do you do it? What force is bigger and stronger than these companies that can whip them into shape. The only answer is either a) government or b) some super organized revolution that probably actually looks kind of like a government when you let it play out, though maybe it's a better one (or maybe not). Governments do a bunch of shitty things, but *sometimes* you can get them to do what you want. (And that doesn't mean they'll do more or less shitty things in the future  #8211; it just means you got what you wanted.) :) Anyway, this is a bit in the weeds.

    <TEXT>Yep. It seems to have worked there. One interesting thing though is that even with all that potential for competition it still consolidates to 3 or 4 ISPs. That's better than 1, but still you need net neutrality rules to keep them from blocking and throttling services (which was happening in Europe a lot). But the unbundling idea makes a lot of sense. I mean, you need competition to keep prices and service reasonable. And the need to wire every home in a city is a recipe for a natural monopoly. If every entrant to the market has to do that, you're not going to have competition (plus it's terribly inefficient).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>We need to win overwhelmingly to make CISA toxic for good. That said, reforms that promote more independent government (public financing of campaigns, breaking up monopolies to decentralize power) are also important to get Congress to start caring more about the opinions of people and unbiased policy experts, not just big corporations. We don't feel bad about all the faxes. We'd prefer that Congress had an open system for constituent communication using best practices of modern technology, but until they make improvements in that area we'll keep jamming their faxes and lighting up the phone lines. Sorry, interns!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>MapLight has identified 50 organizations that publicly support CISA, including a bunch of trade groups that speak for many of the biggest companies: http://maplight.org/us-congress/bill/114-s-754/6636586/total-contributions Though big companies like Google and Facebook have been conspicuously silent on CISA, it's hard to imagine them not being for anything thing that gives them immunity from virtually any law when it comes to their data practices. **EDIT:** Just to answer your second questions, corporate giveaways get attached to big, "must-pass" bills all the time! This is how the worst stuff tends to slip through and get signed into law... recent examples that come to mind include the Monsanto Protection Act and the derivatives deregulation language that was literally drafted by Citigroup. It's hard for the average citizen to track that stuff. That's why the members of Congress who control what goes into the final versions of bills do it that way.</TEXT>

In the last 24 hours, we really can't risk not signing petitions, calling, tweeting and sharing online like here on reddit (which turns out matter a lot). But, that's why we do need to change the way politics is done and not just money in politics, but open up the political process in millions of ways, including by demanding public accountability every step of the way using online and other means, and building a new kind of political movement that is resilient to the Chamber and other big industry doing this kind of thing, and passing possibly something like you suggest.</TEXT>

Another related issue is going from CISPA to CISA... whether its strategy or not, it helps Congress to have a whole new name so we lose some momentum that we've gathered on the last round, even though it's the same bill and they can sound technocratic, "we've changed the bill, it's not the same."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Companies will feel market pressure to share information and get CISA's special immunity protections. If they don't, their competitors will have an advantage. It's also going to favor big companies with resources that can easily comply with the reporting requirements that are likely to be part of the info sharing system. Facebook and other companies really having nothing to lose with CISA, and they have a lot to gain under the immunity provisions. Facebook has shown time and time again that they don't respect user privacy. They are acting like the monopoly they are and trying to get special favors from the government without having to actually provide good services. Since there is essentially no competition in the social networking space, they aren't even that worried about being seen as a mass surveillance portal.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The Senate is about to vote on a bill to reward companies that hand over your data to the NSA. We #8217;re privacy advocates trying to stop it. Join us and call your lawmaker to vote no on the bill: https://stopcyberspying.com and https://decidethefuture.org The reason you keep hearing about these bills is that we keep beating them. The other side has full time lobbyists pushing them every single day. We have you. But together, we keep winning. With your help, we've stopped CISA, the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act, and other "cybersecurity" bills for years; however, they keep on coming back. Last week, the Senate scheduled CISA for a final vote TOMORROW. We've been here before. And you already know the bill is a [surveillance bill in disguise](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/10/eff-strongly-oppose-cisa-cyber-surveillance-bill-and-cfaa-amendment). People have sent millions of faxes (you read that right) to Congress, tweeted at senators, sent emails, and made calls. Over 50 organizations and companies oppose the bill including Access, ACLU, EFF, FFTF, Apple, Yelp, Twitter, and Wikimedia. Fortunately, CISA isn #8217;t law yet, but it will have its final Senate vote this week and we need a dozen more senators to vote against it. Two things you can do right now: * [Call your lawmakers to vote no on the bill this week] (https://www.stopcyberspying.com) * [This is the fastest way to tweet at your senators](https://www.decidethefuture.org) Or just call this and we can connect you: 1-985-222-CISA AMA UPDATE: Our special guest and leading privacy advocate, Senator Wyden has joined the AMA. Please ask him questions! [Here's the proof](https://twitter.com/RonWyden/status/658767505352171520). UPDATE 2(7:45 pm ET): Senator Wyden is now gone. Answering questions today are: [JaycoxEFF](https://www.eff.org/about/staff/mark-m-jaycox), [nadia_k](https://www.eff.org/about/staff/nadia-kayyali), [NathanDavidWhite](https://www.accessnow.org/about/staff), [subject3881](https://www.subject3881.org/aboutus/#team), [evanfftf](https://www.subject3881.org/aboutus/#team), [astepanovich](https://www.accessnow.org/about/staff), [DrewAccess](https://www.accessnow.org/about/staff), [DSchuma](https://demandprogress.org/policy/).

But, that's why we do need to change the way politics is done and not just money in politics, but open up the political process in millions of ways, including by demanding public accountability every step of the way using online and other means, and building a new kind of political movement that is resilient to the Chamber and other big industry doing this kind of thing, and passing possibly something like you suggest.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think we can put an end to CISA for good. We just need to kill it so bad that it becomes toxic and no one in Congress wants to go anywhere near it ever again. That's what happened to SOPA, so we know it's possible. The companies behind this would no doubt continue to try to sneak it through in some other form, but making Congress afraid to touch CISA or similar bills would be a huge step in the right direction.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not really. CISA used to be attached to a larger bill that called on companies operating "crucial infrastructure" to follow basic cybersecurity standards. That seems like a good idea, but the US Chamber of Commerce lobbied hard to get that removed. There is literally nothing in the current form of CISA that would directly improve security on computer networks.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's more that CISA will pass on Tuesday if we don't do anything, and it is barrelling forward towards passage. We need to pull off senators who are on the fence to vote against CISA, or this bill becomes law. And, this fight is a bit different now. CISA has come up in the past, but dynamics are shifting against it right now with a bunch of big tech companies now saying it's bad for privacy. We're also just beginning to understand and relay the extent to which CISA is really about ramping up NSA power to bulk scrape Internet communications. The more we study this, the worse it seems and the more people and companies dislike it.

Ideally, and we're working on this and I know EFF and others are too, we figure out ways people DO want to help out and be informed about what's happening, like with either a mobile app or other notifications, and to get your specific feedback about what you don't want to hear about and what you do want to hear about. As we're trying to win on some of the biggest issues of the day that must be won and fought on, we have to build a system and movement together, so we hope you'll help us do that by giving us ways that you do want to be in touch and pitch in with contacts to decisionmakers.</TEXT>

We're starting to see where use of data is criminal, abusive, dangerous, unconstitutional and I'm hoping that we can draw a line against those things. I see this as the beginning of a big fight we have to figure out, and we're just figuring out where the line gets crossed. We have to think about whether tech is being used in our public interest and at what point is tech straying too far away from that.

    <TITLE>Net neutrality activists launch billboards targeting key Congressional opponents during August recess</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-08-15 17:01:59</DATE>
    <TEXT>Fight for the Future has [released a series of crowdfunded billboards](http://tumblr.subject3881.org/post/164214496033/net-neutrality-activists-launch-crowdfunded) targeting lawmakers who support FCC Chairman Ajit Pai #8217;s efforts to repeal the country #8217;s net neutrality rules. **You can see PHOTOS of some of the billboards [here](https://imgur.com/a/lhEko).** The billboards feature some of the few members of Congress who have publicly supported the FCC #8217;s plan to repeal net neutrality rules. If the current net neutrality protections are lost, Internet providers like Comcast or AT amp;T will be allowed to charge new fees to websites and users, and will be given new powers to throttle or block websites, apps, and online services. Right now, lawmakers are back in their home districts, and many are hosting town hall meetings where constituents can ask questions and speak directly to their reps about important issues like net neutrality. This is a great time to connect with them about the issue. If you #8217;d like to help out, here are a few things you can do: First, **if you live near one of the billboards, snap a picture and post it to social media.** Be sure to [@ tag your representative](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1lDKy4UCPS4AHiMJ0d5B2Lf9Am4Z-E8j3kQhIzrLusEM/edit?usp=drive_web) and use the hashtag #NetNeutrality. Here #8217;s where to find the billboards: * Clarksville, TN (2640 Wilma Rudolph Blvd)  #8211; Rep. Marsha Blackburn (7th District) * Dalton, GA (Walnut Avenue  amp; S. Thornton Ave)  #8211; Rep. Tom Graves (14th District) * Bakersfield, CA (Mohawk St N/O Walker Trail)  #8211; Rep. Kevin McCarthy (23rd District) * Janesville, WI (Milton Ave N/O Holiday Drive)  #8211; Rep. Paul Ryan (1st District) * Rapid City, SD (425 Omaha St)  #8211; Sen. John Thune (At-large) * Jackson, MS (I-55N .4 Mi N/O Fortification St)  #8211; Sen. Roger Wicker (At-large). Second, regardless of where you live, **take a few seconds and [give your elected rep a call.](https://www.battleforthenet.com/?call=1)** Ask them to oppose the FCC #8217;s reckless plan to destroy net neutrality. If you #8217;re in one of the billboard districts, be sure to [call the numbers on the ads](https://imgur.com/a/lhEko). Third, if you live anywhere else, **check out this [huge list of in-district events and town halls](https://events.battleforthenet.com/)** happening over the next few weeks. Sharing the billboards will send a strong message to those who oppose Internet freedom. And attending an in-person event with your member of Congress #8217; office will send an even stronger message that there #8217;s vast public support for strong net neutrality rules to any members of Congress contemplating supporting the FCC #8217;s plan. If you want to get more involved, feel free to message me directly or email team (at) subject3881 (dot) org to get involved, and [learn more here](https://battleforthenet.com).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There #8217;s no doubt the FCC is set on killing net neutrality. **But we can still convince members of Congress to do the right thing.** Three Republican lawmakers have already spoken out against the FCC's repeal: Senator Susan Collins (ME) and House reps Dave Reichert (WA) and John Curtis (UT). Congress can stop the FCC, but not enough of us have stepped up yet. Please do what you can to make sure senator Corker hears from you or the FCC will kill net neutrality on Dec 14th. **1) CALL your lawmakers: http://battleforthenet.com** **2) PROTEST at Verizon stores on Dec 7: http://VerizonProtests.com**</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Here are the 256 representatives that just voted to reauthorize and expand unconstitutional NSA spying</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-01-11 23:47:34</DATE>
    <TEXT>The House of Representatives just voted 256-164 to pass [S. 139](https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/ChartComparingS139andUSARIGHTS11018.pdf), which reauthorizes the U.S. government's mass spying powers under Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act. They also voted down an amendment that attempted to fix the worst parts of the bill and limit domestic spying on American citizens. The bill heads to the Senate this Tuesday, and we only need 41 Senators to stop the vote. A bipartisan group of Senators are already threatening to [filibuster](https://twitter.com/FoxNews/status/951456477029568512), as it does not include Fourth Amendment protections for innocent Americans. **Contact your Senators right now by texting FREEDOM to 384-387** These are the House Representatives (both Democrats and Republicans) who voted in support of reauthorizing and expanding NSA surveillance: * Rep.

    <TEXT>Just last week the House voted [256-164](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2018/roll016.xml) to reauthorize and [expand Section 702](https://theintercept.com/2018/01/11/nsa-pelosi-democrats-spy-american-section-702/) of the Foreign Surveillance Act. The bill passed directly after the House [failed](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2018/roll014.xml) to approve a substitute amendment, the USA Rights Act, which would have explicitly established [warrant protections](https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/ChartComparingS139andUSARIGHTS11018.pdf) from  #8220;backdoor #8221; searches that allow law enforcement agencies like the FBI to search the communications data of U.S. persons in the NSA #8217;s massive databases without needing a warrant. Congress is trying to ram this through without debate. Now, in less than 24 hours the Senate will vote on the bill. But, we only need 41 senators to vote  #8220;NO #8221; on cloture (a  #8220;cloture #8221; vote in the U.S. Senate requires 60 votes to pass and effectively ends debate on a bill) tomorrow, Tuesday, January 16th, possibly as soon as 2:30 ET. Privacy-minded Republicans and many Democrats are already on the [record](https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=115 amp;session=2 amp;vote=00010) opposing the bill, so we can stop cloture and prevent the bill from passing, forcing Congress to go back to the drawing board instead of reauthorizing unconstitutional spying programs for 6 more years. Below is a list of senators who we need to hold to vote  #8220;NO #8221; on cloture. **The vote is in less than 24 hours so you can tweet, call, and email them now.** * Senator Schumer (D-NY) @SenSchumer Phone: (202) 224-6542 * Senator Booker (D-NJ) @CoryBooker Phone: (202) 224-3224 * Senator Heller (R-NV) @SenDeanHeller Phone: 202-224-6244 * Senator Blumenthal (D-CT) @SenBlumenthal Phone: (202) 224-2823 * Senator Cardin (D-MD) @SenatorCardin Phone: (202) 224-4524 * Senator Peters (D-MI) @SenGaryPeters Phone: (202) 224-6221 * Senator Shaheen (D-NH) @SenatorShaheen Phone: (202) 224-2841 * Senator Sullivan (R-AK) @SenDanSullivan Phone: (202)-224-3004 * Senator Bennet (D-CO) @SenBennetCO Phone: 202-224-5852 * Senator Stabenow (D-MI) @SenStabenow Phone: (202) 224-4822 * Senator Klobuchar (D-MN) @amyklobuchar  #8207;Phone: 202-224-3244 * Senator McCaskill (D-MO) @clairecmc Phone: (202) 224-6154 * Senator Cruz (R-TX) @SenTedCruz Phone: (202) 224-5922 * Senator Hassan (D-NH) @SenatorHassan Phone: (202) 224-3324 * Senator Cortez Masto (D-NV) @SenCortezMasto Phone: (202) 224-3542 * Senator Kennedy (R-LA) @SenJohnKennedy Phone: (202) 224-4623 Had the [55 Democrats](https://theintercept.com/2018/01/12/the-same-democrats-who-denounce-trump-as-a-lawless-treasonous-authoritarian-just-voted-to-give-him-vast-warrantless-spying-powers/) that voted against the substitute amendment supported it, the Senate could be passing meaningful privacy reforms tomorrow. Instead, a 702 reauthorization bill that would extend NSA, FBI, and presidential mass spying powers for 6 more years without warrant protections for Americans and includes a pathway for the NSA to again collect even larger amounts of Americans #8217; information through [ #8220;abouts #8221; collection](https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/ChartComparingS139andUSARIGHTS11018.pdf) has been fast-tracked to the Senate where they will vote on its final passage on Tuesday, January 16th. Senators Rand Paul (R-KY) and Ron Wyden (D-OR) are both threatening to filibuster the bill, S. 139, because it does not include meaningful reforms, like an end to warrantless  #8220;backdoor #8221; searches that violate our constitutional right to privacy. See [here](https://reason.com/archives/2018/01/02/no-foreign-spy-program-reauthorization-w?utm_content=bufferbcabd amp;utm_medium=social amp;utm_source=twitter.com amp;utm_campaign=buffer) and [here](https://twitter.com/RonWyden/status/951498975529533440). They #8217;re also joined by Senators Leahy and Lee in a [letter](https://www.paul.senate.gov/news/sens-paul-wyden-lee-and-leahy-urge-senators-oppose-house-passed-fisa-legislation-bipartisan) urging their colleagues to vote no on S. 139 without reforms. Our right to privacy is a cornerstone to a free and democratic society. Now, more than ever, our lawmakers should be safeguarding our freedoms and the US Constitution. Any senator who fails to do so doesn #8217;t belong in the Senate. That #8217;s why we #8217;re [crowdfunding billboards](https://www.vetocongress.org/) targeting lawmakers who support the warrantless mass surveillance of Americans. And, why we #8217;ve built a chat-bot that lets Internet users send letters to their lawmakers and also sends reminders on your lawmakers' vote on FISA before the next election. Text FREEDOM to 384-387 to participate. On Monday, Jan. 15th [tweet](https://twitter.com/danielschuman/status/952932228006375430) and email senators, tell them to vote  #8220;NO #8221; on cloture and vote  #8220;NO #8221; on S. 139. On Tuesday, Jan. 16th, we have to flood their offices with phone calls. Call (202) 804-3305 to hear a script and get connected to your senators #8217; offices. You can also text FREEDOM to 384-387 at any time to send a message to your senators. (Data and message rates apply. Reply "stop" to unsubscribe.)</TEXT>

    <DATE>2018-01-24 18:50:10</DATE>
    <TEXT>Today, AT amp;T [took out](http://thehill.com/policy/technology/370472-att-urges-congress-to-pass-internet-bill-of-rights) full-page ads in a number of major newspapers nationwide claiming that the company supports net neutrality, and calling on Congress to pass legislation, a so-called  #8220;Internet Bill of Rights. #8221; This comes just a day after year-end disclosures [show](http://variety.com/2018/politics/news/lobbying-spending-2017-1202673664/) AT amp;T spent more than $16 million lobbying *against* net neutrality and Internet privacy protections last year alone. At the exact same time that the ads went live, Congressional staffers reported that they started getting flooded with [mysterious tweets](https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets amp;vertical=default amp;q=%22not%20a%20CRA%20that%20can%27t%20pass%22 amp;src=typd) using the hashtag  #8220;#netneutlawnow, #8221; with a message reading:  #8220;We need real net neutrality - not a CRA that can't pass. Please pass a permanent net neutrality law! #8221; If you just search Twitter for the hashtag  #8220;#netneutlawnow, #8221; you only find a few tweets, like [this one](https://twitter.com/ppi/status/954429304850472960), from the Progressive Policy Institute, a  #8220;think tank #8221; that #8217;s been partly [funded](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20141203/09083129312/attempt-to-undermine-title-ii-support-broadband-industry-pretends-to-be-worried-about-your-soaring-broadband-bill.shtml) by  #8230; you guessed it: AT amp;T. If you search for the phrase that #8217;s tweeted, you see large numbers of identical tweets, which appear to be generated through a paid hashtag campaign geo-targeted at people #8217;s lawmakers. Astroturf efforts like these are just the latest in a [long](https://www.alternet.org/economy/corporate-interests-are-stealing-online-identities-and-faking-public-comments-repeal-pro) and sordid [history](https://theintercept.com/2017/05/23/net-neutrality-ncta/) of campaigns funded by big telecom companies attempting to create the false impression that there is grassroots support for their terrible positions on net neutrality and consumer privacy. The purpose of these tweets is to spread misinformation. The ISPs #8217; plan has always been to use the  #8220;crisis #8221; they created by gutting the FCC rules to ram through bad legislation that permanently undermines net neutrality while claiming to  #8220;save it. #8221; But this latest campaign just comes off as a bit desperate. It shows that AT amp;T #8217;s army of lobbyists is scared. The  #8220;CRA #8221; that the tweets mention refers to the Congressional Review Act resolutions that are gaining momentum in both the Senate and the House thanks to the [overwhelming](https://www.recode.net/2018/1/4/16846978/net-neutrality-internet-donald-trump-ajit-pai-fcc-democrats-advocates-election), cross-partisan public support for net neutrality rules, and the massive backlash to the FCC #8217;s repeal of them. The CRA allows our elected officials in Congress to block the FCC #8217;s decision with a simple majority in the Senate and House. We #8217;re currently just one vote away from winning in the Senate, and there are already more than 110 co-sponsors for the CRA in the House. It seems that the giant ISPs that spent millions lobbying to kill the FCC #8217;s net neutrality rules are getting nervous. But lawmakers could be easily fooled by this latest astroturf campaign, so it #8217;s more important than ever to [**contact your Senators and Representatives**](http://battleforthenet.com/?org=fftf) and tell them not to fall for it, and instead to support the CRA resolution and restore the net neutrality protections that should never have been taken away in the first place.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Last week, AT amp;T ran a series of ads and tweets claiming to support net neutrality. This was really an attempt to gain support for bad net neutrality legislation that offers very few of the protections we had under Title II. We need your help exposing this astroturfing effort. Details in the thread.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-01-29 15:47:56</DATE>
    <TEXT>Last week, AT amp;T [took out](http://thehill.com/policy/technology/370472-att-urges-congress-to-pass-internet-bill-of-rights) full-page ads in a number of major newspapers nationwide claiming that the company supports net neutrality, and calling on Congress to pass legislation, a so-called  #8220;Internet Bill of Rights. #8221; This comes just a day after year-end disclosures [show](http://variety.com/2018/politics/news/lobbying-spending-2017-1202673664/) AT amp;T spent more than $16 million lobbying *against* net neutrality and Internet privacy protections last year alone. At the exact same time that the ads went live, Congressional staffers reported that they started getting flooded with [mysterious tweets](https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets amp;vertical=default amp;q=%22not%20a%20CRA%20that%20can%27t%20pass%22 amp;src=typd) using the hashtag  #8220;#netneutlawnow, #8221; with a message reading:  #8220;We need real net neutrality - not a CRA that can't pass. Please pass a permanent net neutrality law! #8221; If you just search Twitter for the hashtag  #8220;#netneutlawnow, #8221; you only find a few tweets, like [this one](https://twitter.com/ppi/status/954429304850472960), from the Progressive Policy Institute, a  #8220;think tank #8221; that #8217;s been partly [funded](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20141203/09083129312/attempt-to-undermine-title-ii-support-broadband-industry-pretends-to-be-worried-about-your-soaring-broadband-bill.shtml) by  #8230; you guessed it: AT amp;T. If you search for the phrase that #8217;s tweeted, you see large numbers of identical tweets, which appear to be generated through a paid hashtag campaign geo-targeted at people #8217;s lawmakers. Astroturf efforts like these are just the latest in a [long](https://www.alternet.org/economy/corporate-interests-are-stealing-online-identities-and-faking-public-comments-repeal-pro) and sordid [history](https://theintercept.com/2017/05/23/net-neutrality-ncta/) of campaigns funded by big telecom companies attempting to create the false impression that there is grassroots support for their terrible positions on net neutrality and consumer privacy. The purpose of these tweets is to spread misinformation. The ISPs #8217; plan has always been to use the  #8220;crisis #8221; they created by gutting the FCC rules to ram through bad legislation that permanently undermines net neutrality while claiming to  #8220;save it. #8221; But this latest campaign just comes off as a bit desperate. It shows that AT amp;T #8217;s army of lobbyists is scared. The  #8220;CRA #8221; that the tweets mention refers to the Congressional Review Act resolutions that are gaining momentum in both the Senate and the House thanks to the [overwhelming](https://www.recode.net/2018/1/4/16846978/net-neutrality-internet-donald-trump-ajit-pai-fcc-democrats-advocates-election), cross-partisan public support for net neutrality rules, and the massive backlash to the FCC #8217;s repeal of them. The CRA allows our elected officials in Congress to block the FCC #8217;s decision with a simple majority in the Senate and House. We #8217;re currently just one vote away from winning in the Senate, and there are already more than 110 co-sponsors for the CRA in the House. It seems that the giant ISPs that spent millions lobbying to kill the FCC #8217;s net neutrality rules are getting nervous. But lawmakers could be easily fooled by this latest astroturf campaign, so it #8217;s more important than ever to [**contact your Senators and Representatives**](http://battleforthenet.com/?org=fftf) and tell them not to fall for it, and instead to support the CRA resolution and restore the net neutrality protections that should never have been taken away in the first place. --- **Here is a Testimonial from someone who felt misled:**  #8220;It looked like an image with a  #8216;Tweet #netneutlawnow #8217; button.

    <TITLE>We need your help investigating an anti net neutrality twitter astroturf campaign</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-02-05 16:27:13</DATE>
    <TEXT>Recently there has been a [paid campaign on twitter](https://medium.com/@fightfortheftr/dont-fall-for-at-t-s-latest-net-neutrality-astroturf-campaign-b8618460dc57) designed to confuse and derail the current net neutrality strategy. Their tactic is to call on twitter users to tweet out a message to their members of Congress opposing the Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolution to restore the FCC #8217;s net neutrality rules (which only needs [one more vote](http://battleforthenet.com/onemorevote) to pass the Senate!) and instead urge their lawmakers to push through bad net neutrality legislation. The problem is that this law will likely fail to pass, and lack most of the Title II protections we fought so hard for in 2015 and in 2017. This is an obvious astroturf play being [funded](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/net-neutrality-progressive-policy-institute_us_5a70f13ee4b0be822ba143f4) by the ISPs and executed by two nebulously named  #8220;think tanks #8221;: The Progressive Policy Institute and The Taxpayer Protection Alliance. What we need from you is to search twitter for tweets containing the hashtags [#No2CRA](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23No2CRA amp;src=typd) or [#netneutlawnow](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23netneutlawnow amp;src=typd) and reply to folks tweeting their pre-written messages with this tweet?:  gt; Hi, did you tweet this? Just FYI these appear to be part of a paid anti-#NetNeutrality hashtag campaign.

    <DATE>2018-03-08 00:31:04</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hey Reddit, this is important. Senator Kennedy of Louisiana just betrayed his constituents, Louisiana small businesses, and millions of Internet users by [introducing](https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kennedy.senate.gov%2Fpublic%2Fpress-releases%3FID%3DE1352949-BF5D-4CCA-8707-BC2B098D27B1 amp;t=YjQ2MTM0NGZhNTkyMGI0MWEyOTFlZDNhZDY4MmRiNTYzMThkYzYxMCxwM0ZZV1Z0Mg%3D%3D amp;b=t%3AKMlLl9GOPd0Y9ROFg2ygww amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Ftumblr.subject3881.org%2Fpost%2F171632833653%2Fupdated-senator-john-kennedy-r-la-just amp;m=1) legislation that essentially outlaws net neutrality while claiming to save it. His bill is a companion to telecom shill Marsha Blackburn #8217;s (R-TN) ridiculous  #8220;Open Internet Preservation Act. #8221; (See bill text here.) This bill is NOT net neutrality. It #8217;s not even  #8220;weak #8221; net neutrality, or a  #8220;compromise. #8221; It #8217;s a bill to kill net neutrality. It [would](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/12/gop-net-neutrality-bill-would-allow-paid-fast-lanes-and-preempt-state-laws/): * Legalize paid prioritization, opening the floodgates for ISPs to charge new fees and discriminate between online content. * Kneecap the FCC #8217;s ability to prevent abuse from ISP monopolies. * Prevent states from enacting their own net neutrality rules (like the one Washington just passed.). This is significant because Senator Kennedy had previously [claimed](http://thehill.com/business-a-lobbying/business-a-lobbying/369255-democrats-search-for-51st-net-neutrality-vote) he was considering supporting the Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolution to overturn the FCC #8217;s repeal of net neutrality, which provides the clearest path to restoring basic protections for Internet users and small businesses that never should have been taken away in the first place. **This is a pivotal moment in the net neutrality fight. It means that we need to unleash the force of the entire Internet on the remaining undecided Senators and tell them to support the CRA rather than selling out to the ISPs like Kennedy did.** These are the other Senators who are still likely to support the net neutrality CRA. Call and tweet at them right now and tell them to support the CRA to save net neutrality, rather than legislation that would permanently undermine it. Name | Twitter | Phone ---|---|---- Senator Flake | @JeffFlake | (202)-224-4521 Senator Heller | @SenDeanHeller | (202)-224-6244 Senator Hatch | @OrrinHatch | (202) 224-5251 Senator Gardner | @SenCoryGardner | (202) 224-5941 Senator Portman | @SenRobPortman | (202)-224-3353 Senator Rubio | @MarcoRubio | (202) 224-3041 Senator Murkowski | @LisaMurkowski | (202)-224-6665 Senator Graham | @LindseyGrahamSC | (202) 224-5972 Senator Kennedy told Politico that he #8217;s still considering supporting the CRA in addition to this terrible legislation that he introduced. That #8217;s a head scratcher. It #8217;s worth calling him and telling him you #8217;re outraged he would introduce such a bad bill. He should withdraw it and publicly support the CRA instead. **Here #8217;s his number: (202) 224-4623 and his twitter handle: @SenJohnKennedy** If we can #8217;t convince Kennedy, then we must get through to the Senators listed above. [Call them](http://battleforthenet.com/call), [tweet them](http://battleforthenet.com/scoreboard), drop in to their office, [organize a protest](http://events.battleforthenet.com/), and make it clear that they MUST support the net neutrality CRA, or you won #8217;t vote for them come election time.</TEXT>

If the CLOUD Act gets added to the omnibus bill, there will be little to zero chance to amend it. **If passed, the the CLOUD Act (S. 2383 and H.R. 4943) would:** * Give U.S. law enforcement the power to access our data anywhere in the world, no matter what country that data is stored in, while bypassing current privacy requirements. * Allow the U.S. president to enter international agreements, without Congressional approval, that allow foreign governments to directly obtain data in the U.S. #8212;while ignoring U.S. privacy laws. * Give foreign states new spying powers inside the U.S. * Allow foreign governments to collect data directly from U.S. companies without requiring a U.S. warrant. Read more about the CLOUD Act from EFF [here](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/03/new-backdoor-around-fourth-amendment-cloud-act) and [here](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/02/cloud-act-dangerous-expansion-police-snooping-cross-border-data), and the ACLU [here](https://www.aclu.org/blog/privacy-technology/internet-privacy/cloud-act-dangerous-piece-legislation) and [here](https://www.aclu.org/letter/coalition-letter-cloud-act). **We can stop this if we show Congressional leadership just how controversial the CLOUD act is. But we need to act now because they #8217;re deciding on the final version of the omnibus bill right now:** * [Sign this petition](https://actionnetwork.org/letters/congress-is-trying-to-sneak-through-a-new-bill-that-would-hand-police-in-the-us-and-around-the-world-extreme-spying-powers) telling your members of Congress to oppose the CLOUD Act and any attempts to add it to the omnibus bill. * Call Congress using the Congressional switchboard number: (202) 224-3121 Tell your representative and both of your senators: Please oppose the CLOUD Act and any attempts to add it the omnibus bill. * Text CLOUD to 384-387 to send a message directly to your lawmakers. (Data and message rates apply. Text STOP to stop receiving messages.) * Email, message or call Senate and House appropriators and tell them to keep the CLOUD Act out of the omnibus bill. These are the offices that will make the decision: * Senate Appropriations chair Senator Thad Cochran: [Email](https://www.cochran.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/email-me), [tweet](https://twitter.com/SenThadCochran) or call: (202) 224-5054 * Senate Appropriations vice-chair Senator Patrick Leahy: [Email](https://www.leahy.senate.gov/contact), [tweet](https://twitter.com/SenatorLeahy) or call: (202) 224-4242 * House Appropriations chair Representative Rodney Frelinghuysen: [Email](https://frelinghuysen.house.gov/contact-form/), [tweet](https://twitter.com/USRepRodney) or call: (202) 225-5034</TEXT>

    <TEXT>*Tldr: The fight for net neutrality is far from over, and we need small business to show their support by signing this open letter to congress: https://www.businessesfornetneutrality.com/* Hey /r/Etsy, The repeal of net neutrality is going to hurt small businesses the most. Family owned shops, freelancers, and ecommerce vendors will have an even harder time competing with the big guys once ISPs can charge new fees for prioritized access to customers. But small business owners can play a crucial role in convincing Congress to block the FCC #8217;s repeal of open Internet protections. **Thousands of businesses are mobilizing [an open letter](https://www.businessesfornetneutrality.com/) to lawmakers, and are planning to deliver it during Small Business Week on May 2.** Direct pressure from small businesses is one of the most effective ways of convincing lawmakers to support net neutrality. And this affects ALL small businesses, from hardware stores to programmers to dog walkers to massage therapists. There are probably tens of thousands of small business owners who use reddit. If you run your own business and care about net neutrality, [sign this letter](https://www.businessesfornetneutrality.com/) and show your support.

    <TITLE>The fate of net neutrality could be decided by alaskan senator lisa murkowski.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-04-18 17:25:17</DATE>
    <TEXT>A few weeks ago Senator Lisa Murkowski [published an op-ed](http://juneauempire.com/opinion/2018-03-26/internet-must-remain-free-and-open) that suggested she was open to supporting the Congressional Review Act (CRA) [resolution](https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/ajit-pai-tried-kill-net-neutrality-internet-fighting-back-ncna854151) to overturn the FCC #8217;s net neutrality repeal -- but stopped just short of saying she #8217;d vote for the bill. It looks like the telecom lobbyists tricked her into believing that things like online education and telemedicine would be impossible if she voted to pass the CRA. But that #8217;s ridiculous. In response, an Alaskan business owner just published an op-ed in reply titled, [ #8220;Sen. Murkowski, don #8217;t vote for the FCC #8217;s Net Neutrality repeal #8221;](http://juneauempire.com/opinion/2018-04-16/sen-murkowski-don-t-vote-fcc-s-net-neutrality-repeal) that debunks the lobbyists #8217; lies. We need everyone in Alaska who cares about net neutrality to read this article, and then overwhelm Senator Murkowski with calls and tweets to make sure she sees it. **Call: 202-224-6665 and say:**  gt; #8220;I #8217;m a constituent and I want Senator Murkowski to read the article by Alaska business owner Jennie Stewart in this week #8217;s Juneau Empire. The Senator is mistaken. Restoring Title II net neutrality will not block Alaskans from online education and health services. I want her to do the right thing and vote for the net neutrality CRA to overturn the FCC #8217;s repeal. #8221; **Then tweet something like:**  gt;Hey @lisamurkowski, don't support the FCC #8217;s #NetNeutrality repeal. Please do the right thing and vote for the CRA to restore strong protections for Alaskans: https://bit.ly/2J5YKqf If Alaskans can convince her to vote for the CRA, she will be the 51st and *final* senator we need to pass the bill and move on to the House of Representatives, where the bill already has 160 signers.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>There have been a lot of inaccurate reports that the FCC's repeal of net neutrality will officially go into effect today, April 23rd. That's not true. It's a bit more complicated than that.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-04-23 17:47:51</DATE>
    <TEXT>**TL;DR: no, net neutrality is not  #8220;officially dead, #8221; today. The fcc repeal has not yet gone into effect. The senate will vote soon on whether to block the repeal. Now #8217;s the time to pay attention!** It #8217;s understandable many journalists are confused by this. It's legitimately confusing. The FCC order said it would go into effect 60 days after publication in the Federal Register, which would have been April 23rd. But, it still has to be approved by the Office of Management  amp; Budget There was another FCC filing in the Federal Register that would imply the earliest the Office of Management  amp; Budget could approve this (and it's worth noting that approval is basically just a technicality) is actually April 27th, but its likely to happen some time after that, possibly even weeks after. The most important thing for **EVERYONE** to understand is that nothing catastrophic or dramatic is going to happen immediately when the FCC rules go into effect. Telecom shills will immediately start saying "See? The sky didn't fall, we never needed Net Neutrality." They're lying. The ISPs aren't going to immediately start blocking content or rolling out paid prioritization scams. They know Congress and the public are watching them. Rather, the death of net neutrality will be slow and insidious. You might not even notice it at first. And that's the worst part. What will happen is over time ISP scams and abuses will become more commonplace and more accepted. They'll roll out new schemes that appear good on their face but undermine the free market of ideas by allowing ISPs to pick winners and losers. Over time we'll see less awesome startups. Less awesome videos. Less diverse online content. And we'll see more content that our ISPs want us to see. The Internet will be watered down and manipulated. It will change forever in ways that harm our democracy. But it will take time. So don't fall for ISP lobbyists talking points. They're **ALREADY** claiming that net neutrality was never needed since the sky hasn't fallen, and the rules haven't even gone into effect. But also don't panic. The Internet is not going to die next week. Keep calm and keep fighting. The Senate will vote in a matter of weeks on a Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolution to block the FCC's repeal. Now is the moment to get engaged.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The Senate vote on the Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolution to overturn the FCC #8217;s net neutrality repeal is coming as early as mid-May. To win, we still need to make sure that a handful of GOP senators vote on our side. Thousands of small businesses across the country have signed an open letter asking Congress to support the CRA. And we need your help to get it into the hands of elected representatives. **[On May 2nd, can you join with Internet users and small business owners to deliver the BusinessesForNetNeutrality.com open letter to congressional offices at 12 pm local time?](https://events.battleforthenet.com/#eventType=letterdelivery)** If you you don #8217;t see an event nearby you can sign up to host a delivery [here](https://act.demandprogress.org/event/team-internet/create/?source=businessesfornetneutrality%5C). Right now there is no more important strategy in the fight to restore net neutrality than for small businesses to pressure Republican senators to vote for the CRA. And with a House vote right around the corner, we need to reach as many members of Congress as possible. We know from experience that in-person deliveries at local offices get their attention. At 12pm local time on May 2nd, you, small business owners, and fellow net neutrality advocates will hand-deliver the net neutrality open letter to members of Congress to get the attention of local reporters during national Small Business Week. **[Can you join small businesses across the country on May 2nd for an open letter delivery at your lawmaker #8217;s office? RSVP for one here.](https://events.battleforthenet.com/#eventType=letterdelivery)** Lawmakers are **really** responding to pressure from small businesses on this issue, so if enough Internet users and businesses show up in person, we could create game-changing pressure to win.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey Alaska. The Senate is voting on a resolution to BLOCK the FCC #8217;s net neutrality repeal THIS Wednesday. This vote will be the most significant vote Congress has ever taken on open Internet issues. 49 senators are already publicly committed to voting for the CRA, which is amazing. We never even thought we #8217;d make it this far, and it #8217;s all thanks to the massive, public support from the overwhelming majority of everyday people uniting around this cause. But to secure the 50th vote we need in order to guarantee a win in the Senate and move on to the House of Representatives #8212;now between the vote #8212;we need to keep as much people-driven pressure on our lawmakers as possible. This is the only way to overcome the power and influence of Big Cable #8217;s lobbyists. Team Internet, a nationwide group of volunteers and activists uniting to save net neutrality, is protesting outside Senator Murkowski #8217;s office this Monday, May 14th. It #8217;s an in-person Red Alert protest for net neutrality, and we need you to stand with us! Senator Murkowski is actively considering supporting the CRA to block the FCC #8217;s net neutrality repeal, let #8217;s make sure she does by showing her just how much love for the rules Alaska has. **Please [go here](https://act.demandprogress.org/event/team-internet/3103) to RSVP and invite a friend or two to come along with you.** [RSVP](https://act.demandprogress.org/event/team-internet/3103) now, do it for the open Internet!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>We #8217;re hearing that Rep. Mike Coffman is open to supporting the CRA, but he still hasn #8217;t signed the  #8220;discharge petition #8221; that would force a vote on the House floor. Over the weekend he tweeted plans to introduce an [ #8220;alternative #8221; net neutrality bill](https://twitter.com/RepMikeCoffman/status/1005938550972481537) even though Internet users and small business owners have [repeatedly asked him to support the CRA](https://twitter.com/fightfortheftr/status/966177358771376129). Coffman is testing the waters. He wants to push his own ISP-approved bill, and if we don #8217;t push back, it could jeopardize all of our hard work to pass the CRA and save net neutrality. **[We need a show of force in response. Click here to reply to Coffman #8217;s tweet and demand he support the CRA to overturn the FCC #8217;s repeal.](https://twitter.com/RepMikeCoffman/status/1005938550972481537)** You can tweet something like this:  #8220;No @RepMikeCoffman, we asked you to support the #NetNeutrality CRA before introducing new legislation. Businesses and users need strong protections ASAP while Congress works on the the long-term solution. #8221; **Then call Rep. Coffman #8217;s DC office (202-225-7882) and ask him to support the CRA before he introduces any new legislation.** Coffman #8217;s bill could take months or even years to debate. Meanwhile Internet users and small businesses across the country would be vulnerable to abuse by ISPs. Besides, Rep. Coffman #8217;s bill has no chance of passing. House Republicans are divided on the issue. And any bill would need 60 votes in the Senate, which isn #8217;t gonna happen in this Congress. We cannot let him think for *one second* that this is OK. We need to shut this down NOW. **[Click here and reply to Coffman #8217;s tweet](https://twitter.com/RepMikeCoffman/status/1005938550972481537) and then call his DC Office (202-225-7882) and let him know it #8217;s  #8220;CRA or bust. #8221;**</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Actually, the CRA deadline only applied to the Senate. The House of Representatives has until the end of this Congress to pass CRA. **So the June 26th meetings will have a big impact on lawmakers.** The CRA rules have confused a lot of people. The 60 session day window was the time period that that the Senate had to vote on the resolution using the "expedited rules" -- meaning it could be passed with a simple majority instead of the usual 60 votes. Thankfully we cleared that hurdle with a historic, bipartisan vote of 52-47. Now we need to pressure House representatives to follow suit, and face-to-face meetings are one of the best ways to make that happen.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Outside of Washington, DC, net neutrality is not a partisan issue. Poll after poll shows that the [overwhelming](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/12/12/this-poll-gave-americans-a-detailed-case-for-and-against-the-fccs-net-neutrality-plan-the-reaction-among-republicans-was-striking/?utm_term=.edde134fd7cf) majority of voters, including Republicans, Democrats, and Independents, oppose the FCC #8217;s repeal of open Internet protections and want Congress to overturn it.** No one wants their cable company to control what they can see and do online.** But telecom mega-corporations like Comcast and AT amp;T have poured nearly $200 million [into lobbying](https://readsludge.com/2018/06/11/today-net-neutrality-officially-dies/) to kill net neutrality. And since FCC Chairman Ajit Pai is a GOP nominee, the issue has become increasingly partisan in DC, with most Democrats lining up in support of a Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolution to restore net neutrality, and so far most Republican lawmakers against, despite the wishes of the [majority](https://gizmodo.com/only-1-in-5-republicans-want-the-fcc-to-gut-net-neutral-1821231973) of GOP voters. But there are still 22 House Democrats that have not yet signed the  #8220;discharge petition #8221; to force a vote on the Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolution. There #8217;s only one reason for this: they #8217;re being pressured by ISP lobbyists to remain silent and sell us out. **Here #8217;s the list.

Earlier this year, we saw that direct constituent pressure in the form of rallys, Senator meetings, and small business letter deliveries was crucial to passing the net neutrality CRA through the Senate with bipartisan support. **Now we need to convince 218 Representatives to do the same in the House. 176 Representatives have already signed on #8212;but TX Representative Will Hurd hasn #8217;t made up his mind just yet!** We need another big push from constituents to get this through the House. **On July 19th, we #8217;re holding a rally and a letter delivery event at Representative Will Hurd office.** This is how we overcome the powerful influence of the ISP lobby on Congress. Events like these played a crucial role in getting the Congressional Review Act (CRA) passed through the Senate. **If you #8217;re looking for the most effective way you as an individual can help in the fight to preserve the open internet, this is it.** Here are the event details: Representative Will Hurd's office 17721 Rogers Ranch Parkway San Antonio, TX 78258 https://www.facebook.com/events/399161130572677/ Hope you all can make it out! --- *This is a post by [Fight for the Future](https://www.subject3881.org/), a grassroots, nonprofit, digital rights group.

    <TEXT>**[You can catch our livestream of the event here at 10 AM EST](https://www.facebook.com/fightfortheftr/videos/2135883156734125/)** This morning at 10 AM EST, members of the Senate Energy and Commerce Committee will be [holding a hearing](https://www.facebook.com/fightfortheftr/videos/2135883156734125/) demanding answers from FCC Chairman Ajit Pai about the phony  #8220;cyber attack #8221; the FCC repeatedly used to downplay the overwhelming opposition to the agency #8217;s repeal of net neutrality. The agency lied to Congress about the alleged attack, which was said to have happened right as millions of John Oliver viewers were trying to file pro-net neutrality comments following the comedians viral broadcast. As a result many voices were excluded from the record, making the FCC #8217;s repeal corrupt and illegitimate. **Head over to [BattleForTheNet.com](https://www.battleforthenet.com/) or call (202) 759-7766 to take action and tell your Representatives in Congress to support the net neutrality Congressional Review Act resolution, which if passed would overturn the repeal.** We #8217;re net neutrality experts and advocates defending the open internet, and we #8217;re here to answer your questions about the hearing today, or anything else related to net neutrality, so ask us anything! We'll be answering your questions till 12:30 PM EST.
