Maatouk, Robin Lovell-Badge. Sex reversal following deletion of a single distal enhancer ofSox9. Science, 2018; eaas9408 DOI: 10.1126/science.aas9408 Link: http://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2018/06/13/science.aas9408 Abstract Cell fate decisions require appropriate regulation of key genes. Sox9, a direct target of SRY, is pivotal in mammalian sex determination. In vivo high-throughput chromatin accessibility techniques, transgenic assays, and genome editing revealed several novel gonadal regulatory elements in the 2-megabase gene desert upstream of Sox9. Although others are redundant, Enh13, a 557 #8211;base pair element located 565 kilobases 5 #8242;, is essential to initiate mouse testis development; its deletion giving XY females with Sox9 transcript levels equivalent to XX gonads. Our data are consistent with the time-sensitive activity of SRY and indicate a strict order of enhancer usage. Enh13 is conserved and embedded within a 32.5-kilobase region whose deletion in patients is associated with XY sex reversal, suggesting it is also critical in humans.</TEXT>

The study, drawn from data collected by electrodes implanted in patients with epilepsy, identifies and measures the neural activity associated with a new conscious experience. Journal Reference: Human single neuron activity precedes emergence of conscious perception Hagar Gelbard-Sagiv, Liad Mudrik, [ #8230;]Itzhak Fried Nature Communications, volume 9, Article number: 2057 (2018) DOI: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-018-03749-0 Link: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03749-0 Abstract Identifying the neuronal basis of spontaneous changes in conscious experience in the absence of changes in the external environment is a major challenge. Binocular rivalry, in which two stationary monocular images lead to continuously changing perception, provides a unique opportunity to address this issue. We studied the activity of human single neurons in the medial temporal and frontal lobes while patients were engaged in binocular rivalry. Here we report that internal changes in the content of perception are signaled by very early (~-2000 #8201;ms) nonselective medial frontal activity, followed by selective activity of medial temporal lobe neurons that precedes the perceptual change by ~1000 #8201;ms. Such early activations are not found for externally driven perceptual changes. These results suggest that a medial fronto-temporal network may be involved in the preconscious internal generation of perceptual transitions.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The title of the post is a copy and paste from the second paragraph of the linked academic press release here :  gt; In a paper forthcoming in The Astrophysical Journal, researchers at the University of California, Riverside and the University of Southern Queensland have identified more than 100 giant planets that potentially host moons capable of supporting life. Their work will guide the design of future telescopes that can detect these potential moons and look for tell-tale signs of life, called biosignatures, in their atmospheres. Journal Reference: Michelle L. Hill, Stephen R. Kane, Eduardo Seperuelo Duarte, Ravi K. Kopparapu, Dawn M. Gelino, Robert A. Wittenmyer. Exploring Kepler Giant Planets in the Habitable Zone. The Astrophysical Journal, 2018; 860 (1): 67 DOI: 10.3847/1538-4357/aac384 Link: http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/aac384/meta Abstract The Kepler mission found hundreds of planet candidates within the Habitable Zones (HZ) of their host star, including over 70 candidates with radii larger than three Earth radii (R  #8853;) within the optimistic HZ (OHZ). These giant planets are potential hosts to large terrestrial satellites (or exomoons) which would also exist in the HZ. We calculate the occurrence rates of giant planets (R p = 3.0 #8211;25 R  #8853;) in the OHZ, and find a frequency of (6.5  #177; 1.9)% for G stars, (11.5  #177; 3.1)% for K stars, and (6  #177; 6)% for M stars. We compare this with previously estimated occurrence rates of terrestrial planets in the HZ of G, K, and M stars and find that if each giant planet has one large terrestrial moon then these moons are less likely to exist in the HZ than terrestrial planets. However, if each giant planet holds more than one moon, then the occurrence rates of moons in the HZ would be comparable to that of terrestrial planets, and could potentially exceed them. We estimate the mass of each planet candidate using the mass #8211;radius relationship developed by Chen  amp; Kipping. We calculate the Hill radius of each planet to determine the area of influence of the planet in which any attached moon may reside, then calculate the estimated angular separation of the moon and planet for future imaging missions. Finally, we estimate the radial velocity semi-amplitudes of each planet for use in follow-up observations.</TEXT>

Few parent education programs include fathers. Among those that do, there is little effort to report program effects on father outcomes. OBJECTIVE: In this systematic review, we examined father-inclusive perinatal parent education programs in the United States as they relate to a range of father outcomes. DATA SOURCES: The databases searched were PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Embase, Ovid Medline, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and PsycINFO. STUDY SELECTION: Studies were included if they included an evaluation of a parent education program and a report of father outcomes measured within 1 year of the child #8217;s birth and were conducted within the United States. DATA EXTRACTION: Of 1353 total articles, 21 met study criteria. RESULTS: The overall state of the father-inclusive perinatal parent education program literature was poor, with few interventions available to fathers. Available programs were associated with increased father involvement, coparenting relationship, partner relationship quality, father #8217;s mental health, and father #8217;s supportive behaviors. Program effects on father-infant interaction, parenting knowledge, and attitudes and parenting self-efficacy were inconclusive. Three programs emerged as best evidence-based interventions. LIMITATIONS: Risk of bias was high for many studies. Outcome variability, small sample size, and publication bias contributed to the weak evidence base.

    <TEXT>The title of the post is a copy and paste from the fourth, fifth and sixth paragraphs of the linked academic press release here :  gt; The study of 1,029 university students found that young adults who reported more maltreatment in childhood were more likely to report problematic social media use.  gt; Students who had experienced physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, emotional neglect, and physical neglect as children tended to also use social media to forget about personal problems and had tried to cut down on social media use without success. They were also more likely to say that they used social media so much that it had a negative impact on them.  gt; The researchers also found childhood maltreatment was linked to higher levels of attachment anxiety and depressive symptoms, which in turn predicted more problematic social media use. Journal Reference: Joanne D. Worsley, Jason C. McIntyre, Richard P. Bentall, Rhiannon Corcoran, Childhood maltreatment and problematic social media use: The role of attachment and depression, Psychiatry Research, Volume 267, 2018, Pages 88-93, ISSN 0165-1781, DOI. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2018.05.023. Link: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165178117318668 Abstract: Childhood maltreatment is associated with many maladaptive outcomes. This study sought to examine the association between childhood maltreatment and problematic social media use using a cross-sectional sample of young adults aged 17 #8211;25 years (n #8239;= #8239;1029). Specifically, we studied whether the relationship is mediated through (i) attachment anxiety, (ii) attachment avoidance, or (iii) both attachment dimensions operating in series with depressive symptoms. Results revealed that a history of childhood maltreatment was significantly associated with more problematic social media use. Both anxious and avoidant attachment dimensions independently mediated the relationship between childhood maltreatment and problematic use of social media, but in opposing directions. Avoidant attachment was associated with less problematic social media use, whilst anxious attachment was associated with more problematic social media use. Avoidant attachment and depressive symptoms in series accounted for part of the relationship between childhood maltreatment and problematic social media use. Anxious attachment and depressive symptoms in series fully mediated the relationship between childhood maltreatment and problematic social media use. The results suggest that childhood maltreatment may influence social media use directly, but also indirectly. People experiencing depressive symptoms may overuse social media in an attempt to alleviate their distress. However, causality cannot be established with the current design.</TEXT>

The compound was tested against clinical isolates.  gt; F6, which is nontoxic to humans and other mammals, works against bacteria in a group known as Gram-positive, but not against those that are Gram-negative. F6 was effective against MRSA, VRSA, Enterococcus faecalis, which lives in the human gut, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) and Listeria monocytogenes, often associated with unpasteurized dairy products.

From screening a chemical library, we identified compounds with antibacterial activity. The most potent compounds, F6-5 and F6 inhibited growth of various drug-resistant Gram-positive bacterial pathogens at concentrations ranging from 1 #8239; #956;g/mL to 2 #8239; #956;g/mL. Both compounds were active against clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-intermediate and vancomycin-resistant S. aureus (VISA and VRSA respectively) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (VRE). Resistance generation experiments revealed that MRSA could develop resistance to the antibiotic ciprofloxacin but not to F6. Excitingly, F6 was found to be non-toxic against mammalian cells. In a mouse skin wound infection model, F6 was equipotent to the antibiotic fusidic acid in reducing MRSA burden.</TEXT>

Counties in which over 75% of the population had access to community water fluoridation saw a 30% reduction in dental caries experience in the primary dentition, and a 12% reduction in dental caries experience in the permanent dentition, compared to counties in which less than 75% had access to community water fluoridation. Journal Reference: G.D. Slade, W.B. Grider, W.R. Maas, A.E. Sanders. Water Fluoridation and Dental Caries in U.S. Children and Adolescents.

Yet there is a paucity of studies from the past 3 decades investigating its dental health benefits in the U.S. population. This cross-sectional study sought to evaluate associations between availability of community water fluoridation (CWF) and dental caries experience in the U.S. child and adolescent population. County-level estimates of the percentage of population served by CWF (% CWF) from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention #8217;s Water Fluoridation Reporting System were merged with dental examination data from 10 y of National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (1999 to 2004 and 2011 to 2014). Dental caries experience in the primary dentition (decayed and filled tooth surfaces [dfs]) was calculated for 7,000 children aged 2 to 8 y and in the permanent dentition (decayed, missing, and filled tooth surfaces [DMFS]) for 12,604 children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 y. Linear regression models estimated associations between % CWF and dental caries experience with adjustment for sociodemographic characteristics: age, sex, race/ethnicity, rural-urban location, head-of-household education, and period since last dental visit. Sensitivity analysis excluded counties fluoridated after 1998. In unadjusted analysis, caries experience in the primary dentition was lower in counties with  #8805;75% CWF (mean dfs = 3.3; 95% confidence limit [CL] = 2.8, 3.7) than in counties with  lt;75% CWF (mean dfs = 4.6; 95% CL = 3.9, 5.4), a prevented fraction of 30% (95% CL = 11, 48). The difference was also statistically significant, although less pronounced, in the permanent dentition: mean DMFS (95% CL) was 2.2 (2.0, 2.4) and 1.9 (1.8, 2.1), respectively, representing a prevented fraction of 12% (95% CL = 1, 23). Statistically significant associations likewise were seen when % CWF was modeled as a continuum, and differences tended to increase in covariate-adjusted analysis and in sensitivity analysis. These findings confirm a substantial caries-preventive benefit of CWF for U.S. children and that the benefit is most pronounced in primary teeth.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The title of the post is a copy and paste from the title of the linked academic press release here :  gt; Researchers have compared different cognitive strategies for falling out of love And the following sections of the abstract of the journal article:  gt; This study evaluated three regulation strategies: (1) negative reappraisal of the ex-partner, (2) reappraisal of love feelings, and (3) distraction. It was tested how these regulation strategies change love feelings for the ex-partner, valence of affect, and motivated attention for the ex-partner. Participants who were upset about a romantic break-up performed these regulation strategies before passively viewing a picture of their ex-partner, during which their electroencephalogram was recorded.  gt; This suggests that in the context of a romantic break-up, negative reappraisal is an effective love down-regulation strategy, whereas distraction is an effective positive emotion up-regulation strategy. Journal Reference: Langeslag, S. J. E.,  amp; Sanchez, M. E. (2018). Down-regulation of love feelings after a romantic break-up: Self-report and electrophysiological data. Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, 147(5), 720-733. DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/xge0000360 Link: http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-37800-001 Abstract Because remaining love feelings for an ex-partner are negatively associated with recovery from a romantic break-up, it may be helpful to decrease those love feelings. Love regulation is the use of behavioral or cognitive strategies to change the intensity of current feelings of romantic love. This study evaluated three regulation strategies: (1) negative reappraisal of the ex-partner, (2) reappraisal of love feelings, and (3) distraction. It was tested how these regulation strategies change love feelings for the ex-partner, valence of affect, and motivated attention for the ex-partner. Participants who were upset about a romantic break-up performed these regulation strategies before passively viewing a picture of their ex-partner, during which their electroencephalogram was recorded. Negative reappraisal decreased love feelings and made participants feel more unpleasant. Love reappraisal did not change how in love or pleasant/unpleasant participants felt. Distraction did not change love feelings but made participants feel more pleasant. This suggests that in the context of a romantic break-up, negative reappraisal is an effective love down-regulation strategy, whereas distraction is an effective positive emotion up-regulation strategy. Furthermore, all three strategies decreased motivated attention for the ex-partner, as indicated by a reduced amplitude of the late positive potential. This reduced motivated attention for the ex-partner could make it easier to deal with encounters of (reminders of) the ex-partner. Love regulation is a promising phenomenon with important everyday life and clinical implications.</TEXT>

Journal Reference: Neural Responsiveness to Reward as an Index of Depressive Symptom Change Following Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy and SSRI Treatment Katie L. Burkhouse, PhD; Stephanie M. Gorka, PhD; Heide Klumpp, PhD; Amy E. Kennedy, LCSW; Shannon Karich, BA; Jennifer Francis, PhD; Olusola Ajilore, MD; Michelle G. Craske, PhD; Scott A. Langenecker, PhD; Stewart A. Shankman, PhD; Greg Hajcak, PhD; and K. Luan Phan, MD J Clin Psychiatry 2018;79(4):17m11836 DOI: 10.4088/JCP.17m11836 Link: https://www.psychiatrist.com/JCP/article/Pages/2018/v79/17m11836.aspx Abstract Objective: Reward positivity (RewP), a neurophysiologic index of reward responsivity, is consistently reduced in participants with depression and, to a lesser extent, anxiety. It remains unknown, however, whether RewP can be altered as psychiatric symptoms change with treatment. The current study addressed this question by examining differences in RewP within patients before and after 12 weeks of treatment with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). We also examined the utility of RewP as a predictor of symptom change during CBT and SSRI treatment. Methods: Participants were recruited between 2014 and 2017 and included adults with a primary DSM-5 anxiety or depressive disorder (n = 63) and healthy controls (n = 25). At baseline and 12 weeks, participants completed a monetary award task while electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded. Between EEG sessions, patients completed CBT or SSRI treatment. Results: At baseline, higher levels of depressive symptoms were associated with a more attenuated RewP. We found no significant differences between patients and healthy controls in the degree of RewP change across the 12 weeks; however, among patients, the extent of increase in RewP robustly correlated with the extent of decline in depressive (t =  #8211;2.21, P = .03) and anxiety (t =  #8211;2.57, P = .02) symptoms following CBT and SSRI treatment. Additionally, a more attenuated RewP at baseline predicted a greater reduction in depressive symptoms following treatment with SSRIs (t =  #8211;2.04, P  lt; .05), but not after CBT. Conclusions: These findings highlight neural responsiveness to reward as both a mechanism and a predictor of depressive symptom change that may be used serve as an objective index of symptom improvement.</TEXT>

However, the effect of this diet on body weight in obese subjects has never been examined. OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the effects of 8-h time restricted feeding on body weight and metabolic disease risk factors in obese adults. DESIGN: Obese subjects (n #8202;= #8202;23) participated in an 8-h time restricted feeding intervention (ad libitum feeding between 10:00 to 18:00 #8202;h, water fasting between 18:00 to 10:00 #8202;h) for 12 weeks.

RESULTS: Body weight and energy intake decreased in the time restricted group ( #8211;2.6%  #177; 0.5;  #8211;341  #177; 53 #8202;kcal/d) relative to controls over 12 weeks (P #8202; lt; #8202;0.05).

    <TEXT>Journal Reference: Jeffrey L. Moran, Anton L. Cottrill, Jesse D. Benck, Pingwei Liu, Zhe Yuan, Michael S. Strano, Jacopo Buongiorno. Noble-gas-infused neoprene closed-cell foams achieving ultra-low thermal conductivity fabrics. RSC Advances, 2018; 8 (38): 21389 DOI: 10.1039/c8ra04037k Link: http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2018/RA/C8RA04037K#!divAbstract Abstract Closed-cell foams are widely applied as insulation and essential for the thermal management of protective garments for extreme environments. In this work, we develop and demonstrate a strategy for drastically reducing the thermal conductivity of a flexible, closed-cell polychloroprene foam to 0.031  #177; 0.002 W m #8722;1 K #8722;1, approaching values of an air gap (0.027 W m #8722;1 K #8722;1) for an extended period of time ( gt;10 hours), within a material capable of textile processing. Ultra-insulating neoprene materials are synthesized using high-pressure processing at 243 kPa in a high-molecular-weight gas environment, such as Ar, Kr, or Xe. A Fickian diffusion model describes both the mass infusion and thermal conductivity reduction of the foam as a function of processing time, predicting a 24 #8211;72 hour required exposure time for full charging of a 6 mm thick 5 cm diameter neoprene sample. These results enable waterproof textile insulation that approximates a wearable air gap.

    <TEXT>Journal Reference: Jeffrey L. Moran, Anton L. Cottrill, Jesse D. Benck, Pingwei Liu, Zhe Yuan, Michael S. Strano, Jacopo Buongiorno. Noble-gas-infused neoprene closed-cell foams achieving ultra-low thermal conductivity fabrics. RSC Advances, 2018; 8 (38): 21389 DOI: 10.1039/c8ra04037k Link: http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2018/RA/C8RA04037K#!divAbstract Abstract Closed-cell foams are widely applied as insulation and essential for the thermal management of protective garments for extreme environments. In this work, we develop and demonstrate a strategy for drastically reducing the thermal conductivity of a flexible, closed-cell polychloroprene foam to 0.031  #177; 0.002 W m #8722;1 K #8722;1, approaching values of an air gap (0.027 W m #8722;1 K #8722;1) for an extended period of time ( gt;10 hours), within a material capable of textile processing. Ultra-insulating neoprene materials are synthesized using high-pressure processing at 243 kPa in a high-molecular-weight gas environment, such as Ar, Kr, or Xe. A Fickian diffusion model describes both the mass infusion and thermal conductivity reduction of the foam as a function of processing time, predicting a 24 #8211;72 hour required exposure time for full charging of a 6 mm thick 5 cm diameter neoprene sample. These results enable waterproof textile insulation that approximates a wearable air gap. We demonstrate a wetsuit made of ultra-low thermally conductive neoprene capable of potentially extending dive times to 2 #8211;3 hours in water below 10  #176;C, compared with  lt;1 hour for the state-of-the-art. This work introduces the prospect of effectively wearing a flexible air gap for thermal protection in harsh environments.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Journal Reference: Sung Hoon Hwang, Rouzbeh Shahsavari. High calcium cementless fly ash binder with low environmental footprint: Optimum Taguchi design. Journal of the American Ceramic Society, 2018; DOI: 10.1111/jace.15873 Link: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jace.15873 Abstract Despite the myriad of research efforts on exploiting fly ash as an alternative binder, its current role in industry is largely restricted to the supplementary use, which enables only partial replacement of conventional Portland cement. Herein, we propose an unprecedented binder composite with the promising early #8208;age strength, which is cost #8208;effective and reduces the CO2 footprint compared to Portland cement. The major constituent is fly ash occupying 76.4 #8208;80.3% by the total mass of the constituents, while calcium oxide, nanosilica and the minimum amounts of sodium #8208;based activators are added to induce the early #8208;age strength development. Optimization of the composition via the Taguchi design of experiments produced the early (7 #8208;day) compressive strength of 16.18 MPa. This value is encouraging considering that it is comparable to that of conventional Portland cement and that a cementless composition with the minimum amounts of sodium #8208;based activators was employed. The extensive materials analysis demonstrates that the starting Ca/Na molar ratio and the amount of nanosilica play instrumental roles in strength development by influencing the formation of key reaction products, which include the sodium #8208;substituted AFm phase (the U #8208;phase), katoite and portlandite. Overall, the promising early #8208;age strength coupled with the significantly decreased amount of sodium #8208;based chemicals and the reduced CO2 footprint will lay a foundation for development of low #8208;cost, environmentally #8208;friendly binder in diverse industries.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The title of the post is a copy and paste from the first, second and fourth paragraphs of the linked academic press release here :  gt; Daily fasting is an effective tool to reduce weight and lower blood pressure, according to a new study published by University of Illinois at Chicago researchers in the journal Nutrition and Healthy Aging.  gt; The study is the first to examine the effect of time-restricted eating  #8212; a form of fasting that limits food consumption to select hours each day  #8212; on weight loss in obese individuals.  gt; Between the hours of 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. the dieters could eat any type and quantity of food they desired, but for the remaining 16 hours they could only drink water or calorie-free beverages. The study followed the participants for 12 weeks. Journal Reference: Kelsey Gabel, Kristin K. Hoddy, Nicole Haggerty, Jeehee Song, Cynthia M. Kroeger, John F. Trepanowski, Satchidananda Panda, Krista A. Varady. Effects of 8-hour time restricted feeding on body weight and metabolic disease risk factors in obese adults: A pilot study. Nutrition and Healthy Aging, 2018; 4 (4): 345 DOI: 10.3233/NHA-170036 Link: https://content.iospress.com/articles/nutrition-and-healthy-aging/nha170036 Abstract BACKGROUND: Time restricted feeding decreases energy intake without calorie counting and may be a viable option for weight loss. However, the effect of this diet on body weight in obese subjects has never been examined. OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the effects of 8-h time restricted feeding on body weight and metabolic disease risk factors in obese adults. DESIGN: Obese subjects (n = 23) participated in an 8-h time restricted feeding intervention (ad libitum feeding between 10:00 to 18:00 h, water fasting between 18:00 to 10:00 h) for 12 weeks. Weight loss and other outcomes were compared to a matched historical control group (n = 23). RESULTS: Body weight and energy intake decreased in the time restricted group ( #8211;2.6%  #177; 0.5;  #8211;341  #177; 53 kcal/d) relative to controls over 12 weeks (P  lt; 0.05). Systolic blood pressure decreased in the time restricted feeding group ( #8211;7  #177; 2 mm Hg) versus controls (P  lt; 0.05). Fat mass, lean mass, visceral fat mass, diastolic blood pressure, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, fasting glucose, fasting insulin, HOMA-IR, and homocysteine were not significantly different from controls after 12 weeks (no group #215;time interaction). CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that 8-h time restricted feeding produces mild caloric restriction and weight loss, without calorie counting. It may also offer clinical benefits by reducing blood pressure.</TEXT>

The effects of exercise on the symptoms of schizophrenic patients under antipsychotic treatment are inconclusive. The aim of this randomized case-control study was to examine the effects of aerobic exercise (AE) on the symptoms of schizophrenic patients receiving antipsychotic treatment. Methods: In total, 33 and 29 participants being treated with antipsychotics for schizophrenia were randomly assigned into the aerobic exercise (AE) group and the control group, respectively. The severities of schizophrenic symptoms were measured using the Chinese version of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) before, immediately after, and 3 months after the intervention in both groups. Results: In total, 24 participants (72.7%) in the AE group and 22 (75.9%) in the control group completed the study. The results indicated that the severities of positive symptoms and general psychopathology in the AE group significantly decreased during the 12 weeks of intervention but did not further significantly change during the 3-month follow-up period. The severities of negative symptoms in the AE group decreased significantly after 12 weeks of intervention and continued decreasing during the 3-month follow-up period.

Journal Reference: Rohrer, J. M.,  amp; Lucas, R. E. (2018). Only so Many Hours: Correlations between Personality and Daily Time Use in a Representative German Panel. Collabra: Psychology, 4(1), 1. DOI: http://doi.org/10.1525/collabra.112 Link: https://www.collabra.org/articles/10.1525/collabra.112/ Abstract Time is a finite resource, strictly limited to 24 hours a day. How people spend these resources is in many ways determined by necessities and external constraints, yet research on personality-situation transactions shows that people also choose their environments to resonate with their personality. This finding implies that daily time use and individual traits should be correlated. However, few studies have linked modern methods for assessing time use to individual differences in personality traits. In this study, we investigate correlations between the Big Five traits and time spent on various daily activities in the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP), including 5,456 days in the lives of 1,364 individuals. Results converged towards previously reported personality-situation transactions. For example, extraversion predicted whether or not respondents reported meeting their friends, whereas openness was correlated negatively with watching TV. Effects were modest in size, ranging from r~~.10 to .25. Taking together, our findings corroborate the notion that our personality is robustly associated with the way we spend our lives.</TEXT>

Participants: Twenty-three male and female collegiate athletes (20  #177; 1 years) following (4  #177; 1 days) a sports-related concussion and 23 sports- and sex-matched noninjured controls. Procedure: Continuous R-R interval was acquired using 3-lead electrocardiogram for 3 minutes each at rest and during the 2-Back task. HRV was quantified as percent high-frequency (HF) power. Results: At rest, lower percent HF power was observed in the concussed athletes (23  #177; 11) compared with the controls (38  #177; 14; P = .0027). However, with the 2-Back task, an increase in HF power was observed in the concussed group (39  #177; 12; P = .0008) from rest and was comparable with the controls (36  #177; 15). No difference in HF power between rest and 2-Back task was observed in the controls. Conclusion: Lower HRV was observed at rest following concussion. An increase in HRV, suggestive of enhanced prefrontal cortex (PFC) functioning, was observed during a cognitive task in the concussed athletes. Therefore, cognitive tasks as early as 4 days after injury may increase PFC functioning from rest and expedite return to learn in collegiate athletes.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The title of the post is a copy and paste from the subtitle and third paragraph of the linked academic press release here :  gt; Research shows the poor prognosis when psychopath marries psychopath.  gt; When a psychopath becomes involved with another psychopath, however, neither partner is able to provide this type of emotional support. Manipulative and unfeeling, both members of the couple lie whenever it #8217;s convenient to do so, and take advantage of opportunities for personal gain. Their personal goals outweigh their goals as a couple, even if puts the other person at risk of material or emotional loss. Journal Reference: Weiss, B., Lavner, J. A.,  amp; Miller, J. D. (2018). Self- and partner-reported psychopathic traits #8217; relations with couples #8217; communication, marital satisfaction trajectories, and divorce in a longitudinal sample. Personality Disorders: Theory, Research, And Treatment, 9(3), 239-249. doi:10.1037/per0000233 Link: http://psycnet.apa.org/buy/2016-60702-001 Abstract Given that psychopathy is composed in large part by an antagonistic relational approach and is associated with many troubling interpersonally relevant outcomes, its role in romantic functioning warrants greater attention. The current study used data from a community sample of 172 newlywed couples to examine spouses #8217; psychopathic traits in relation to their partners #8217; psychopathic traits, observed communication, 4-year marital satisfaction trajectories, and 10-year divorce rates. Spouses reporting greater levels of psychopathic traits were married to partners reporting greater levels of psychopathic traits. Psychopathic traits were correlated cross-sectionally with more negative affect and less positive affect during conversations regarding sources of tension in the relationship. Longitudinally, hierarchical linear modeling of spouses #8217; 4-year marital trajectories indicated that psychopathic traits generally predicted lower initial and sustained marital satisfaction for spouses and their partners over time. In addition, wives #8217; ratings of husbands #8217; psychopathic traits predicted declines in husbands #8217; satisfaction over time and elevated 10-year divorce rates. These findings highlight the relationship impairment associated with psychopathic traits, indicate that this impairment is present from the beginning of couples #8217; marital trajectories, and show that psychopathic traits predict divorce. Findings also suggest that partner-ratings of psychopathic traits provide substantial incremental validity in the prediction of marital functioning outcomes relative to self-ratings. Future research on the pathways by which psychopathic traits undermine relationship functioning over time would be valuable.</TEXT>

Mauro, PhD, assistant professor of Epidemiology at the Mailman School of Public Health and first author. Journal Reference: Age Differences in Daily and Nondaily Cannabis Use in the United States, 2002 #8211;2014 Pia M. Mauro, Hannah Carliner, Qiana L. Brown, Deborah S. Hasin, Dvora Shmulewitz, Reanne Rahim-Juwel, Aaron L. Sarvet, Melanie M. Wall, and Silvia S. Martins Journal of Studies on Alcohol and Drugs 2018 79:3, 423-431 DOI: https://doi.org/10.15288/jsad.2018.79.423 Link: https://www.jsad.com/doi/full/10.15288/jsad.2018.79.423 Abstract Objective: Adult cannabis use has increased in the United States since 2002, particularly after 2007, contrasting with stable/declining trends among youth. We investigated whether specific age groups disproportionately contributed to changes in daily and nondaily cannabis use trends. Method: Participants ages 12 and older (N = 722,653) from the 2002 #8211;2014 National Survey on Drug Use and Health reported past-year cannabis use frequency (i.e., daily =  #8805;300 days/year; nondaily = 1 #8211;299 days/year; none). Multinomial logistic regression was used to model change in past-year daily and nondaily cannabis use prevalence by age group (i.e., 12 #8211;17, 18 #8211;25, 26 #8211;34, 35 #8211;49, 50 #8211;64,  #8805;65), before and after 2007. Multinomial logistic regressions estimated change in relative odds of cannabis use frequency over time by age, adjusting for other sociodemographics. Results: Daily cannabis use prevalence decreased in ages 12 #8211;17 before 2007 and increased significantly across adult age categories only after 2007. Increases did not differ significantly across adult ages 18 #8211;64 and ranged between 1 and 2 percentage points. Nondaily cannabis use decreased among respondents ages 12 #8211;25 and 35 #8211;49 before 2007 and increased across adult age categories after 2007, particularly among adults 26 #8211;34 (i.e., 4.5 percentage points). Adjusted odds of daily versus nondaily cannabis use increased after 2007 for ages 12 #8211;64. Conclusions: Increases in daily and nondaily cannabis use prevalence after 2007 were specific to adult age groups in the context of increasingly permissive cannabis legislation, attitudes, and lower risk perception. Although any cannabis use may be decreasing among teens, relative odds of more frequent use among users increased in ages 12 #8211;64 since 2007. Studies should assess not only any cannabis use, but also frequency of use, to target prevention efforts of adverse effects of cannabis that are especially likely among frequent users.</TEXT>

Cultural Variation in Ideal Levels of Happiness, Pleasure, Freedom, Health, Self-Esteem, Longevity, and Intelligence Matthew J. Hornsey, Paul G. Bain, Emily A. Harris, Nadezhda Lebedeva, Emiko S. Kashima, Yanjun Guan, Roberto Gonz #225;lez, Sylvia Xiaohua Chen, Sheyla Blumen Psychological Science 2018 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1177/0956797618768058 Link: http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956797618768058 Abstract The maximization principle #8212;that people aspire to the highest possible level of something good if all practical constraints are removed #8212;is a common yet untested assumption about human nature. We predict that in holistic cultures #8212;where contradiction, change, and context are emphasized #8212;ideal states of being for the self will be more moderate than in other cultures. In two studies (Ns = 2,392 and 6,239), we asked this question: If participants could choose their ideal level of happiness, pleasure, freedom, health, self-esteem, longevity, and intelligence, what level would they choose? Consistent with predictions, results showed that maximization was less pronounced in holistic cultures; members of holistic cultures aspired to less happiness, pleasure, freedom, health, self-esteem, longevity, and IQ than did members of other cultures. In contrast, no differences emerged on ideals for society. The studies show that the maximization principle is not a universal aspect of human nature and that there are predictable cultural differences in people #8217;s notions of perfection.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The title of the post is a copy and paste from the title and second paragraph of the linked academic press release here :  gt; Around the world, people have surprisingly modest notions of the  #8216;ideal #8217; life  gt;  #8220;People wanted to have positive qualities, such as health and happiness, but not to the exclusion of other darker experiences  #8211; they wanted about 75% of a good thing. #8221; Journal Reference: How Much Is Enough in a Perfect World? Cultural Variation in Ideal Levels of Happiness, Pleasure, Freedom, Health, Self-Esteem, Longevity, and Intelligence Matthew J. Hornsey, Paul G. Bain, Emily A. Harris, Nadezhda Lebedeva, Emiko S. Kashima, Yanjun Guan, Roberto Gonz #225;lez, Sylvia Xiaohua Chen, Sheyla Blumen Psychological Science 2018 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1177/0956797618768058 Link: http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956797618768058 Abstract The maximization principle #8212;that people aspire to the highest possible level of something good if all practical constraints are removed #8212;is a common yet untested assumption about human nature. We predict that in holistic cultures #8212;where contradiction, change, and context are emphasized #8212;ideal states of being for the self will be more moderate than in other cultures. In two studies (Ns = 2,392 and 6,239), we asked this question: If participants could choose their ideal level of happiness, pleasure, freedom, health, self-esteem, longevity, and intelligence, what level would they choose? Consistent with predictions, results showed that maximization was less pronounced in holistic cultures; members of holistic cultures aspired to less happiness, pleasure, freedom, health, self-esteem, longevity, and IQ than did members of other cultures. In contrast, no differences emerged on ideals for society. The studies show that the maximization principle is not a universal aspect of human nature and that there are predictable cultural differences in people #8217;s notions of perfection.</TEXT>

Here we report 25 experiments testing whether being instructed to adopt another person #8217;s perspective increases interpersonal insight. These experiments include a wide range of accuracy tests that disentangle egocentrism and accuracy, such as predicting another person #8217;s emotions from facial expressions and body postures, predicting fake versus genuine smiles, predicting when a person is lying or telling the truth, and predicting a spouse #8217;s activity preferences and consumer attitudes. Although a large majority of pretest participants believed that perspective taking would systematically increase accuracy on these tasks, we failed to find any consistent evidence that it actually did so. If anything, perspective taking decreased accuracy overall while occasionally increasing confidence in judgment. Perspective taking reduced egocentric biases, but the information used in its place was not systematically more accurate. A final experiment confirmed that getting another person #8217;s perspective directly, through conversation, increased accuracy but that perspective taking did not. Increasing interpersonal accuracy seems to require gaining new information rather than utilizing existing knowledge about another person. Understanding the mind of another person is therefore enabled by getting perspective, not simply taking perspective.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Journal reference: Natural and anthropogenic drivers of cub recruitment in a large carnivore Femke Broekhuis Ecology and Evolution 2018 First published: 17 June 2018 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.4180 Link: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ece3.4180 Abstract Recruitment is a critical parameter governing population dynamics and influences population persistence. Understanding the drivers of recruitment is therefore important for conservation, especially for long #8208;lived mammals such as large carnivores, which have low reproductive rates, rendering them prone to extinction. Using cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus) as a model species, I investigated the variation in cub recruitment in relation to habitat and the abundance of tourists and predators. Per litter, female cheetahs on average raised 1.71  #177; 1.35 cubs to independence, but this varied depending on the presence of open habitat and the abundance of tourists, both of which had a negative effect on cub recruitment. More specifically, female cheetahs that were mostly found in open habitats on average raised 1.69  #177; 0.14 cubs per litter to independence compared to 3.04  #177; 0.26 cubs in denser habitat. Similarly, female cheetahs that were exposed to high tourist abundance on average raised 0.21  #177; 0.72 cubs to independence compared to 2.32  #177; 0.11 cubs in low tourism areas. Neither lion nor spotted hyaena abundance had an impact on the number of cubs that were recruited. Based on these findings, I recommend that the importance of a heterogeneous environment should be taken into consideration in habitat management, restoration efforts, and reintroduction programs. In addition, tourist quotas should be put in place in high visitation areas and strict wildlife viewing guidelines, such as number of vehicles, tourist behavior, time spent, and distance to a sighting, should be enforced. Cub recruitment is an important component of species persistence and incorporating these findings could aid conservation efforts for species that are increasingly under threat.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Reference: Computing the minimal crew for a multi-generational space travel towards Proxima Centauri b F. Marin, C. Beluffi (Submitted on 11 Jun 2018) The survival of a genetically healthy multi-generational crew is of a prime concern when dealing with space travel. It has been shown that determining a realistic population size is tricky as many parameters (such as infertility, inbreeding, sudden deaths, accidents or random events) come into play. To evaluate the impact of those parameters, Monte Carlo simulations are among the best methods since they allow testing of all possible scenarios and determine, by numerous iterations, which are the most likely. This is why we use the Monte Carlo code HERITAGE to estimate the minimal crew for a multi-generational space travel towards Proxima Centauri b. By allowing the crew to evolve under a list of adaptive social engineering principles (namely yearly evaluations of the vessel population, offspring restrictions and breeding constraints), we show in this paper that it is possible to create and maintain a healthy population virtually indefinitely. A initial amount of 25 breeding pairs of settlers drives the mission towards extinction in 50 +/- 15% of cases if we completely forbid inbreeding. Under the set of parameters described in this publication, we find that a minimum crew of 98 people is necessary ensure a 100% success rate for a 6300-year space travel towards the closest telluric exoplanet known so far.

We compared various estimated sodium intakes with that measured by the gold-standard method of multiple non-consecutive 24-h urine collections and assessed their relationship with mortality. Methods We analysed the Trials of Hypertension Prevention follow-up data. Sodium intake was assessed in four ways: (i) average measured (gold standard): mean of three to seven 24-h urinary sodium measurements during the trial periods; (ii) average estimated: mean of three to seven estimated 24-h urinary sodium excretions from sodium concentration of 24-h urine using the Kawasaki formula; (iii) first measured: 24-h urinary sodium measured at the beginning of each trial; (iv) first estimated: 24-h urinary sodium estimated from sodium concentration of the first 24-h urine using the Kawasaki formula. We included 2974 individuals aged 30 #8211;54 #8201;years with pre-hypertension, not assigned to sodium intervention. Results During a median follow-up of 24 #8201;years, 272 deaths occurred. The average sodium intake measured by the gold-standard method was 3769 #8201; #177; #8201;1282 #8201;mg/d. The average estimated sodium over-estimated the intake by 1297 #8201;mg/d (95% confidence interval: 1267 #8211;1326). The average estimated value was systematically biased with over-estimation at lower levels and under-estimation at higher levels. The average measured sodium showed a linear relationship with mortality. The average estimated sodium appeared to show a J-shaped relationship with mortality. The first measured and the first estimated sodium both flattened the relationship. Conclusions Accurately measured sodium intake showed a linear relationship with mortality. Inaccurately estimated sodium changed the relationship and could explain much of the paradoxical J-shaped findings reported in some cohort studies.</TEXT>

CDKN1B/p27 is localized in mitochondria and improves respiration-dependent processes in the cardiovascular system #8212;New mode of action for caffeine. PLOS Biology, 2018; 16 (6): e2004408 DOI: 10.1371/journal.pbio.2004408 Link: http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2004408 Abstract We show that the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B (CDKN1B)/p27, previously known as a cell cycle inhibitor, is also localized within mitochondria. The migratory capacity of endothelial cells, which need intact mitochondria, is completely dependent on mitochondrial p27. Mitochondrial p27 improves mitochondrial membrane potential, increases adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content, and is required for the promigratory effect of caffeine. Domain mapping of p27 revealed that the N-terminus and C-terminus are required for those improvements. Further analysis of those regions revealed that the translocation of p27 into the mitochondria and its promigratory activity depend on serine 10 and threonine 187. In addition, mitochondrial p27 protects cardiomyocytes against apoptosis. Moreover, mitochondrial p27 is necessary and sufficient for cardiac myofibroblast differentiation. In addition, p27 deficiency and aging decrease respiration in heart mitochondria. Caffeine does not increase respiration in p27-deficient animals, whereas aged mice display improvement after 10 days of caffeine in drinking water. Moreover, caffeine induces transcriptome changes in a p27-dependent manner, affecting mostly genes relevant for mitochondrial processes. Caffeine also reduces infarct size after myocardial infarction in prediabetic mice and increases mitochondrial p27. Our data characterize mitochondrial p27 as a common denominator that improves mitochondria-dependent processes and define an increase in mitochondrial p27 as a new mode of action of caffeine. Author summary The protein p27 is a nuclear cell cycle inhibitor that can be shuttled to the cytoplasm to inactivate its inhibitory role, and this mechanism is thought to be used by cancer cells to unlock cell cycle arrest. Recent reports, however, have shown that p27 has other roles independent of cell cycle regulation, and it was observed that p27 mutant mice had increased mortality to myocardial infarction. Here, we have analyzed the potential role of p27 in the major cell types of the heart and shown that it is also present in mitochondria, the cellular powerhouses, where it fulfils important functions. We find that p27 is required for migration of endothelial cells by enhancing mitochondrial functions and that caffeine concentrations reached after consumption of 4 cups of coffee induce its translocation into mitochondria. Moreover, we observe that mitochondrial p27 protects heart muscle cells from cell death and is necessary for the conversion of fibroblasts into mechanically strong, contractile myofibroblasts, a process critical after myocardial infarction. Molecularly, we show that p27 is essential for caffeine-induced gene expression changes that mainly affect mitochondria and for mitochondrial respiration. We conclude that mitochondrial p27 improves mitochondria-dependent processes in heart cells and that physiological concentrations of caffeine have a protective effect.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The title of the post is a copy and paste from the title and first paragraph of the linked academic press release here :  gt; Caffeine from four cups of coffee protects the heart with the help of mitochondria  gt; A new study now shows that caffeine promotes the movement of a regulatory protein into mitochondria, enhancing their function and protecting cardiovascular cells from damage. The work, publishing 21 June in the open access journal PLOS Biology, by Judith Haendeler and Joachim Altschmied of the Medical Faculty, Heinrich-Heine-University and the IUF-Leibniz Research Institute for Environmental Medicine in Duesseldorf, Germany, and colleagues, found that the protective effect was reached at a concentration equivalent to consumption of four cups of coffee, suggesting the effect may be physiologically relevant.

    <TEXT>The title of the post is a copy and paste from the title, second, seventh and eight paragraphs of the linked academic press release here :  gt; Ketamine acts fast to treat depression and its effects last  #8212; but how?  gt; Now, researchers led by Mark Rasenick, distinguished professor of physiology and psychiatry in the University of Illinois at Chicago College of Medicine, describe the molecular mechanisms behind ketamine #8217;s ability to squash depression and keep it at bay. They report their findings in the journal Molecular Psychiatry.  gt; In his current research, Rasenick and his colleagues performed a similar experiment with ketamine and noticed that the G proteins left the rafts much faster. G proteins began migrating out of the lipid rafts within 15 minutes. And the long-lasting effects of ketamine may be due to the fact that the G proteins were very slow to move back into the lipid rafts, Rasenick explained.  gt; The finding contradicts the long-held idea that ketamine works solely by blocking a cellular receptor called the NMDA receptor, which sits on the surface of nerve cells and helps transmit signals. Journal Reference: Nathan H. Wray, Jeffrey M. Schappi, Harinder Singh, Nicolas B. Senese, Mark M. Rasenick. NMDAR-independent, cAMP-dependent antidepressant actions of ketamine. Molecular Psychiatry, 2018; DOI: 10.1038/s41380-018-0083-8 Link: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-018-0083-8 Abstract Ketamine produces rapid and robust antidepressant effects in depressed patients within hours of administration, often when traditional antidepressant compounds have failed to alleviate symptoms. We hypothesized that ketamine would translocate G #945;s from lipid rafts to non-raft microdomains, similarly to other antidepressants but with a distinct, abbreviated treatment duration. C6 glioma cells were treated with 10 #8201; #181;M ketamine for 15 #8201;min, which translocated G #945;s from lipid raft domains to non-raft domains. Other NMDA antagonist did not translocate G #945;s from lipid raft to non-raft domains. The ketamine-induced G #945;s plasma membrane redistribution allows increased functional coupling of G #945;s and adenylyl cyclase to increase intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Moreover, increased intracellular cAMP increased phosphorylation of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), which, in turn, increased BDNF expression. The ketamine-induced increase in intracellular cAMP persisted after knocking out the NMDA receptor indicating an NMDA receptor-independent effect. Furthermore, 10 #8201; #181;M of the ketamine metabolite (2R,6R)-hydroxynorketamine (HNK) also induced G #945;s redistribution and increased cAMP. These results reveal a novel antidepressant mechanism mediated by acute ketamine treatment that may contribute to ketamine #8217;s powerful antidepressant effect. They also suggest that the translocation of G #945;s from lipid rafts is a reliable hallmark of antidepressant action that might be exploited for diagnosis or drug development.</TEXT>

Methods This study used descriptive and logistic regression analyses based on a pooled nationally representative cross #8208;sectional survey, Health Survey for England, for the years 1997, 1998, 2002, 2014, and 2015 of individuals with BMI #8201; #8805; #8201;25 (n #8201;= #8201;23,459). The main outcomes were (1) weight misperception and (2) weight #8208;loss attempts as well as the associations with demographic and socioeconomic characteristics and health status. Results The proportion of individuals with overweight and obesity misperceiving their weight status increased over time between 1997 and 2015 (37% to 40% in men; 17% to 19% in women). There were socioeconomic disparities in the misperception of weight status, with lower #8208;educated individuals from poorer #8208;income households and members of minority ethnic groups being more likely to underestimate their weight. Those underestimating their overweight and obesity status were 85% less likely to try to lose weight compared with people who accurately identified their weight status. Conclusions The upward trend in underassessment of overweight and obesity status in England is possibly a result of the normalization of overweight and obesity. Obesity prevention programs need to consider differential sociodemographic characteristics associated with underassessment of weight status.</TEXT>

We report the results of a meta-analysis of perceived LAS in work settings, drawing from a database of 754 correlations across 72 studies (83 unique samples, N #8201;= #8201;32,870). Results showed LAS correlated strongly and positively with autonomous work motivation, and was unrelated to controlled work motivation. Correlations became increasingly positive with the more internalized forms of work motivation described by self-determination theory. LAS was positively associated with basic needs, well-being, and positive work behaviors, and was negatively associated with distress. Correlations were not moderated by the source of LAS, country of the sample, publication status, or the operationalization of autonomy support. In addition, a meta-analytic path analysis supported motivational processes that underlie LAS and its consequences in workplaces. Overall, our findings lend support for autonomy support as a leadership approach that is consistent with self-determination and optimal functioning in work settings.</TEXT>

Journal Reference: Martin James, Cunliffe Jack, D #233;cary-H #233;tu David, Aldridge Judith. Effect of restricting the legal supply of prescription opioids on buying through online illicit marketplaces: interrupted time series analysis BMJ 2018; 361 :k2270 doi: https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.k2270 Link: https://www.bmj.com/content/361/bmj.k2270 Abstract Objective To examine the effect on the trade in opioids through online illicit markets ( #8220;cryptomarkets #8221;) of the US Drug Enforcement Administration #8217;s ruling in 2014 to reschedule hydrocodone combination products. Design Interrupted time series analysis. Setting 31 of the world #8217;s largest cryptomarkets operating from October 2013 to July 2016. Main outcome measures The proportion of total transactions, advertised and active listings for prescription opioids, prescription sedatives, prescription steroids, prescription stimulants, and illicit opioids, and the composition of the prescription opioid market between the US and elsewhere. Results The sale of prescription opioids through US cryptomarkets increased after the schedule change, with no statistically significant changes in sales of prescription sedatives, prescription steroids, prescription stimulants, or illicit opioids. In July 2016 sales of opioids through US cryptomarkets represented 13.7% of all drug sales (95% confidence interval 11.5% to 16.0%) compared with a modelled estimate of 6.7% of all sales (3.7% to 9.6%) had the new schedule not been introduced. This corresponds to a 4 percentage point yearly increase in the amount of trade that prescription opioids represent in the US market, set against no corresponding changes for comparable products or for prescription opioids sold outside the US. This change was first observed for sales, and later observed for product availability. There was also a change in the composition of the prescription opioid market: fentanyl was the least purchased product during July to September 2014, then the second most frequently purchased by July 2016. Conclusions The scheduling change in hydrocodone combination products coincided with a statistically significant, sustained increase in illicit trading of opioids through online US cryptomarkets. These changes were not observed for other drug groups or in other countries. A subsequent move was observed towards the purchase of more potent forms of prescription opioids, particularly oxycodone and fentanyl.</TEXT>

These giant planets are potential hosts to large terrestrial satellites (or exomoons) which would also exist in the HZ. We calculate the occurrence rates of giant planets (R p = 3.0 #8211;25 R  #8853;) in the OHZ, and find a frequency of (6.5  #177; 1.9)% for G stars, (11.5  #177; 3.1)% for K stars, and (6  #177; 6)% for M stars. We compare this with previously estimated occurrence rates of terrestrial planets in the HZ of G, K, and M stars and find that if each giant planet has one large terrestrial moon then these moons are less likely to exist in the HZ than terrestrial planets. However, if each giant planet holds more than one moon, then the occurrence rates of moons in the HZ would be comparable to that of terrestrial planets, and could potentially exceed them. We estimate the mass of each planet candidate using the mass #8211;radius relationship developed by Chen  amp; Kipping. We calculate the Hill radius of each planet to determine the area of influence of the planet in which any attached moon may reside, then calculate the estimated angular separation of the moon and planet for future imaging missions.

The study found social prestige predicted longitudinal changes in testosterone among men in a university marching band.  gt;  #8220;The winner effect refers to how an animal that has won a fight or some kind of competition is more likely to go on winning in subsequent encounters. #8221;  gt;  #8220;It turns out that winning produces a surge in testosterone, and this rising level of testosterone increases an individual #8217;s competitive ability, such as its persistence and confidence, and thus increasing the odds of future victories #8221; Journal Reference: Prestige in a large-scale social group predicts longitudinal changes in testosterone. By Cheng, Joey T.,Kornienko, Olga,Granger, Douglas A. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, Vol 114(6), Jun 2018, 924-944 doi: 10.1037/pspi0000126. Link: http://psycnet.apa.org/buy/2018-22169-003 Abstract In many social species, organisms adaptively fine-tune their competitive behavior in response to previous experiences of social status: Individuals who have prevailed in the past preferentially compete in the future, whereas those who have suffered defeat tend to defer and submit. A growing body of evidence suggests that testosterone functions as a  #8220;competition hormone #8221; that coordinates this behavioral plasticity through its characteristic rise and fall following victory and defeat. Although well demonstrated in competitions underpinned by dominance (fear-based status derived from force and intimidation), this pattern has not been examined in status contests that depend solely on prestige #8212;respect-based status derived from success, skills, and knowledge in locally valued domains, devoid of fear or antagonism. Thus, the hormonal mechanisms underlying prestige-based status are largely unknown. Here, we examine the effects of previous experiences of prestige #8212;assessed using community-wide nominations of talent and advice provision #8212;on intraindividual changes in testosterone in a large-scale naturalistic community. Results revealed that men who achieve high standing in the group #8217;s prestige hierarchy in the initial weeks of group formation show a rise in testosterone over the subsequent 2 months, whereas men with low-prestige show a decline or little change in testosterone #8212;a pattern consistent with the functional significance of context-specific testosterone responses. No significant associations were found in women. These results suggest that the long-term up- and downregulation of testosterone provides a mechanism through which past experiences of prestige calibrate psychological systems in a manner that adaptively guides future efforts in seeking and maintaining prestige.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The title of the post is a copy and paste from the first and second paragraphs of the linked academic press release here :  gt; The disappearance of an entire brain region should be cause for concern. Yet, for decades scientists have calmly maintained that one brain area, the subplate, simply vanishes during the course of human development. Recently, however, research has revealed genetic similarities between cells in the subplate and neurons implicated in autism #8212;leading a team of Rockefeller scientists to wonder: what if subplate cells don #8217;t actually vanish at all?  gt; In a new paper, which appears in Cell Stem Cell, Ali H. Brivanlou, the Robert and Harriet Heilbrunn Professor, and postdoctoral associate Zeeshan Ozair demonstrate that subplate neurons survive, and in fact become part of the adult cerebral cortex, a brain area involved in complex cognitive functions. The team outlines a connection between subplate neurons and certain brain disorders, and further identifies a strategy for treating such disorders via innovative stem cell techniques. Journal Reference: M. Zeeshan Ozair, Christoph Kirst, Bastiaan L. van den Berg, Albert Ruzo, Tiago Rito, Ali H. Brivanlou. hPSC Modeling Reveals that Fate Selection of Cortical Deep Projection Neurons Occurs in the Subplate. Cell Stem Cell, 2018; DOI: 10.1016/j.stem.2018.05.024 Link: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1934590918302790 Highlights  #8226; Subplate neurons (SPNs) in vitro can generate cortex deep projection neurons (DPNs)  #8226; SPNs in fetal cortex express multiple markers of DPNs and enter the cortical plate  #8226; WNT signaling regulates post-mitotic projection neuron identity of SPNs  #8226; SPNs in the caudal cortex are the only cells enriched in corticofugal neuron genes Summary Cortical deep projection neurons (DPNs) are implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders. Although recent findings emphasize post-mitotic programs in projection neuron fate selection, the establishment of primate DPN identity during layer formation is not well understood. The subplate lies underneath the developing cortex and is a post-mitotic compartment that is transiently and disproportionately enlarged in primates in the second trimester. The evolutionary significance of subplate expansion, the molecular identity of its neurons, and its contribution to primate corticogenesis remain open questions. By modeling subplate formation with human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), we show that all classes of cortical DPNs can be specified from subplate neurons (SPNs). Post-mitotic WNT signaling regulates DPN class selection, and DPNs in the caudal fetal cortex appear to exclusively derive from SPNs. Our findings indicate that SPNs have evolved in primates as an important source of DPNs that contribute to cortical lamination prior to their known role in circuit formation.</TEXT>

Journal reference: Trapped in a Daydream: Daily Elevations in Maladaptive Daydreaming Are Associated With Daily Psychopathological Symptoms Nirit Soffer-Dudek and Eli Somer Front Psychiatry. 2018; 9: 194. Doi: 10.3389/fpsyt.2018.00194 Link: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5962718/ Abstract Background: Maladaptive Daydreaming (MD) characterizes individuals who engage in vivid, fanciful daydreaming for hours on end, neglecting real-life relationships and responsibilities, resulting in clinical distress and functional impairment. Sufferers have embraced the term MD in cyber-communities devoted to this problem because it seemed to uniquely fit their experience and since existing diagnostic labels and their therapies seemed inadequate. However, scientific research in the field has been scarce, relying on cross-sectional or case study designs. Existing knowledge on MD suggests the involvement of dissociative and obsessive-compulsive symptoms, as well as positive reinforcement comparable to processes in addiction disorders. The present study aimed to rigorously explore factors that accompany MD employing a longitudinal daily-diary design, hypothesizing that temporal increases in MD will associate concurrently with, and will temporally precede, other symptoms and emotional changes. In addition, we aimed to explore which symptoms may act as precursors to increases in MD, in order to identify possible mechanisms bringing about daydreaming in these individuals. Methods: In a sample of 77 self-diagnosed individuals with MD we assessed relevant daily symptoms for 14 days, including MD, depression, general anxiety, social anxiety, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and dissociation, as well as positive and negative emotion. Results: Increases in MD were strongly related to concurrent increases in all other symptoms and negative emotion, and to decreased positive emotion. Obsessive-compulsive symptoms, dissociation, and negative emotion also temporally followed MD. Obsessive-compulsive symptoms were the only consistent temporal antecedent of MD. Conclusions: MD and obsessive-compulsive symptoms coincided in what seems to be a vicious cycle; understanding possible shared mechanisms between these symptoms may inform our understanding of the etiology of MD. For example, Serotonin levels may possibly be involved in the development or maintenance of this condition. The findings may also provide clues as to potentially beneficial interventions for treating MD. For example, perhaps utilizing response prevention techniques may be useful for curbing or intercepting unwanted daydreaming. Future studies on MD should address its compulsory nature.</TEXT>

Journal Reference: A Randomized Controlled Trial of Parent-Child Psychotherapy Targeting Emotion Development for Early Childhood Depression Joan L. Luby, Deanna M. Barch, Diana Whalen, Rebecca Tillman, and Kenneth E. Freedland American Journal of Psychiatry 2018 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.ajp.2018.18030321 Link: https://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.ajp.2018.18030321 Abstract Objective: Clinical depression in children as young as age 3 has been validated, and prevalence rates are similar to the school-age disorder. Homotypic continuity between early and later childhood depression has been observed, with alterations in brain function and structure similar to those reported in depressed adults. These findings highlight the importance of identifying and treating depression as early as developmentally possible, given the relative treatment resistance and small effect sizes for treatments later in life. The authors conducted a randomized controlled trial of a dyadic parent-child psychotherapy for early childhood depression that focuses on enhancing the child #8217;s emotional competence and emotion regulation. Method: A modified version of the empirically tested parent-child interaction therapy with a novel  #8220;emotion development #8221; module (PCIT-ED) was compared with a waiting list condition in a randomized controlled trial in 229 parent-child dyads with children 3 #8211;6.11 years of age. Both study arms lasted 18 weeks. Results: Children in the PCIT-ED group had lower rates of depression (primary outcome), lower depression severity, and lower impairment compared with those in the waiting list condition (Cohen #8217;s d values,  gt;1.0). Measures of child emotional functioning and parenting stress and depression were significantly improved in the PCIT-ED group. Conclusions: The findings from this randomized controlled trial of a parent-child psychotherapy for early childhood depression suggest that earlier identification and intervention in this chronic and relapsing disorder represents a key new pathway for more effective treatment. Manualized PCIT-ED, administered by master #8217;s-level clinicians, is feasible for delivery in community health settings.</TEXT>

Results: Children in the PCIT-ED group had lower rates of depression (primary outcome), lower depression severity, and lower impairment compared with those in the waiting list condition (Cohen #8217;s d values,  gt;1.0). Measures of child emotional functioning and parenting stress and depression were significantly improved in the PCIT-ED group. Conclusions: The findings from this randomized controlled trial of a parent-child psychotherapy for early childhood depression suggest that earlier identification and intervention in this chronic and relapsing disorder represents a key new pathway for more effective treatment. Manualized PCIT-ED, administered by master #8217;s-level clinicians, is feasible for delivery in community health settings.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The title of the post is a copy and paste from the title and first two paragraphs of the linked academic press release here :  gt; Reducing trait anxiety by implanting false positive memories  gt; Most of us are healthily deluded by memory biases that inflate our self-esteem. We remember more positive personal events than negative, for instance, and we selectively recall or even edit memories in a way that bolsters our favoured view of ourselves. A pair of psychologists at Lomonosov Moscow University propose that for people with persistent anxiety, this process goes awry. The worrier #8217;s negative self-concept is instead reinforced by the selective recall of previous painful and awkward memories, harming their confidence and fuelling anxiety.  gt; Imagine if it were possible to implant more positive autobiographical memories in these anxious individuals. This could boost their self-esteem, increase their confidence, thus dialling down their anxiety levels. In an intriguing new study published in Memory, Veronika Nourkova and Darya Vaslienko have provided preliminary evidence that such an approach could work, although they found that hypnosis was required to make the memory implantation convincing enough. Journal Reference: Veronika V. Nourkova  amp; Darya A. Vasilenko (2017) On the advantage of autobiographical memory pliability: implantation of positive self-defining memories reduces trait anxiety, Memory, 26:7, 869-881, DOI: 10.1080/09658211.2017.1420195 Link: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09658211.2017.1420195 Abstract This paper is devoted to the mechanism of the positive construction of autobiographical memory. Positive construction consists of the spontaneous transformation of memories in the direction of the subjective enhancement of self-competence in past activities to anticipate improvement over time. We speculated that trait anxiety may indicate a failure to exhibit this mechanism that results in a deficit of affirmative self-esteem. We hypothesised that the implantation of positive self-defining memories in anxiety-evoking domains would decrease trait anxiety. One hundred twenty adults recollected three negative self-defining memories. Then, half of the participants imagined episodes of desired behaviour that differed from the originally recollected ones either in discussion or in hypnosis. Thirty participants experienced a hypnotic state without any references to memories, and the rest formed the control group. Subjects from the  #8220;Memory Implantation in Hypnosis #8221; group became unable to distinguish the originally reported memories from the imagined ones, exhibited decreased trait anxiety scores after a 4-month delay, and reported enhanced self-esteem. In contrast, the participants from the  #8220;Hypnosis with no reference to the past #8221; group exhibited decreased scores at a short delay but later returned to their original scores. These findings highlight the power of cured episodic-like autobiographical memory for updating the self.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The title of this post is taken from the title, second and third paragraphs of the linked article:  gt; People with  #8220;Maladaptive Daydreaming #8221; spend an average of four hours a day lost in their imagination Journal reference: Trapped in a Daydream: Daily Elevations in Maladaptive Daydreaming Are Associated With Daily Psychopathological Symptoms Nirit Soffer-Dudek and Eli Somer Front Psychiatry. 2018; 9: 194. Doi: 10.3389/fpsyt.2018.00194 Link: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5962718/ Abstract Background: Maladaptive Daydreaming (MD) characterizes individuals who engage in vivid, fanciful daydreaming for hours on end, neglecting real-life relationships and responsibilities, resulting in clinical distress and functional impairment. Sufferers have embraced the term MD in cyber-communities devoted to this problem because it seemed to uniquely fit their experience and since existing diagnostic labels and their therapies seemed inadequate. However, scientific research in the field has been scarce, relying on cross-sectional or case study designs. Existing knowledge on MD suggests the involvement of dissociative and obsessive-compulsive symptoms, as well as positive reinforcement comparable to processes in addiction disorders. The present study aimed to rigorously explore factors that accompany MD employing a longitudinal daily-diary design, hypothesizing that temporal increases in MD will associate concurrently with, and will temporally precede, other symptoms and emotional changes. In addition, we aimed to explore which symptoms may act as precursors to increases in MD, in order to identify possible mechanisms bringing about daydreaming in these individuals. Methods: In a sample of 77 self-diagnosed individuals with MD we assessed relevant daily symptoms for 14 days, including MD, depression, general anxiety, social anxiety, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and dissociation, as well as positive and negative emotion. Results: Increases in MD were strongly related to concurrent increases in all other symptoms and negative emotion, and to decreased positive emotion. Obsessive-compulsive symptoms, dissociation, and negative emotion also temporally followed MD. Obsessive-compulsive symptoms were the only consistent temporal antecedent of MD. Conclusions: MD and obsessive-compulsive symptoms coincided in what seems to be a vicious cycle; understanding possible shared mechanisms between these symptoms may inform our understanding of the etiology of MD. For example, Serotonin levels may possibly be involved in the development or maintenance of this condition. The findings may also provide clues as to potentially beneficial interventions for treating MD. For example, perhaps utilizing response prevention techniques may be useful for curbing or intercepting unwanted daydreaming. Future studies on MD should address its compulsory nature.</TEXT>

Journal Reference: Amrita Banerjee, Kelly Ibsen, Tyler Brown, Renwei Chen, Christian Agatemor, Samir Mitragotri. Ionic liquids for oral insulin delivery. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 2018; 201722338 DOI: 10.1073/pnas.1722338115 Link: http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/06/19/1722338115 Significance Insulin is currently available as an injectable formulation, but an oral product would enjoy higher patient compliance and would significantly improve the quality of life of diabetic patients worldwide. However, oral delivery of proteins such as insulin is challenging due to various gastrointestinal barriers to oral absorption of macromolecules. We have developed a safe and highly effective ionic liquid-based oral insulin formulation that significantly enhanced oral insulin absorption by efficiently circumventing the gastrointestinal barriers. Besides, the formulation demonstrated good stability at room temperature and under refrigeration. Evidence from cell and animal studies supports a promising prospect of development of the formulation into a clinical product. Abstract With the rise in diabetes mellitus cases worldwide and lack of patient adherence to glycemia management using injectable insulin, there is an urgent need for the development of efficient oral insulin formulations. However, the gastrointestinal tract presents a formidable barrier to oral delivery of biologics. Here we report the development of a highly effective oral insulin formulation using choline and geranate (CAGE) ionic liquid. CAGE significantly enhanced paracellular transport of insulin, while protecting it from enzymatic degradation and by interacting with the mucus layer resulting in its thinning. In vivo, insulin-CAGE demonstrated exceptional pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic outcome after jejunal administration in rats. Low insulin doses (3 #8211;10 U/kg) brought about a significant decrease in blood glucose levels, which were sustained for longer periods (up to 12 hours), unlike s.c. injected insulin. When 10 U/kg insulin-CAGE was orally delivered in enterically coated capsules using an oral gavage, a sustained decrease in blood glucose of up to 45% was observed. The formulation exhibited high biocompatibility and was stable for 2 months at room temperature and for at least 4 months under refrigeration. Taken together, the results indicate that CAGE is a promising oral delivery vehicle and should be further explored for oral delivery of insulin and other biologics that are currently marketed as injectables.</TEXT>

Journal Reference: Kesson Magid, Robert T. Chatterton, Farid Uddin Ahamed, Gillian R. Bentley. Childhood ecology influences salivary testosterone, pubertal age and stature of Bangladeshi UK migrant men. Nature Ecology  amp; Evolution, 2018; DOI: 10.1038/s41559-018-0567-6 Link: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-018-0567-6 Abstract Male reproductive investment is energetically costly, and measures of human reproductive steroid hormones (testosterone), developmental tempo (pubertal timing) and growth (stature) correlate with local ecologies at the population level. It is unclear whether male reproductive investment in later life is  #8216;set #8217; during childhood development, mediated through adulthood, or varies by ethnicity. Applying a life-course model to Bangladeshi migrants to the United Kingdom, here we investigate plasticity in human male reproductive function resulting from childhood developmental conditions. We hypothesized that childhood ecology shapes adult trade-offs between reproductive investment and/or other fitness-related traits. We predicted correspondence between these traits and developmental timing of exposure to ecological constraints (Bangladesh) or conditions of surplus (United Kingdom). We compared: Bangladesh sedentees (n #8201;= #8201;107); Bangladeshi men who migrated in childhood to the United Kingdom (n #8201;= #8201;59); migrants who arrived in adulthood (n #8201;= #8201;75); second-generation UK-born and raised children of Bangladeshi migrants (n #8201;= #8201;56); and UK-born ethnic Europeans (n #8201;= #8201;62). Migration before puberty predicted higher testosterone and an earlier recalled pubertal age compared with Bangladeshi sedentees or adult migrants, with more pronounced differences in men who arrived before the age of eight. Second-generation Bangladeshis were taller, with higher testosterone than sedentees and adult migrants, and higher waking testosterone than Europeans. Age-related testosterone profiles varied by group, declining in UK migrants, increasing in sedentees, and having no significant relationship within UK-born groups. We conclude that male reproductive function apparently remains plastic late into childhood, is independent of Bengali or European ethnicity, and shapes physiological trade-offs later in life.</TEXT>

We predicted correspondence between these traits and developmental timing of exposure to ecological constraints (Bangladesh) or conditions of surplus (United Kingdom). We compared: Bangladesh sedentees (n #8201;= #8201;107); Bangladeshi men who migrated in childhood to the United Kingdom (n #8201;= #8201;59); migrants who arrived in adulthood (n #8201;= #8201;75); second-generation UK-born and raised children of Bangladeshi migrants (n #8201;= #8201;56); and UK-born ethnic Europeans (n #8201;= #8201;62). Migration before puberty predicted higher testosterone and an earlier recalled pubertal age compared with Bangladeshi sedentees or adult migrants, with more pronounced differences in men who arrived before the age of eight. Second-generation Bangladeshis were taller, with higher testosterone than sedentees and adult migrants, and higher waking testosterone than Europeans. Age-related testosterone profiles varied by group, declining in UK migrants, increasing in sedentees, and having no significant relationship within UK-born groups. We conclude that male reproductive function apparently remains plastic late into childhood, is independent of Bengali or European ethnicity, and shapes physiological trade-offs later in life.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The title of the post is a copy and paste from the title, subtitle, second and sixth paragraphs of the linked academic press release here :  gt; Delivering insulin in a pill  gt; Technique could replace daily injections for diabetics  gt; Now, researchers at the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS) have developed an oral delivery method that could dramatically transform the way in which diabetics keep their blood sugar levels in check.  gt; The key to the new approach is to carry insulin in an ionic liquid comprised of choline and geranic acid that is then put inside a capsule with an acid-resistant enteric coating. Journal Reference: Amrita Banerjee, Kelly Ibsen, Tyler Brown, Renwei Chen, Christian Agatemor, Samir Mitragotri. Ionic liquids for oral insulin delivery. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 2018; 201722338 DOI: 10.1073/pnas.1722338115 Link: http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/06/19/1722338115 Significance Insulin is currently available as an injectable formulation, but an oral product would enjoy higher patient compliance and would significantly improve the quality of life of diabetic patients worldwide. However, oral delivery of proteins such as insulin is challenging due to various gastrointestinal barriers to oral absorption of macromolecules. We have developed a safe and highly effective ionic liquid-based oral insulin formulation that significantly enhanced oral insulin absorption by efficiently circumventing the gastrointestinal barriers. Besides, the formulation demonstrated good stability at room temperature and under refrigeration. Evidence from cell and animal studies supports a promising prospect of development of the formulation into a clinical product. Abstract With the rise in diabetes mellitus cases worldwide and lack of patient adherence to glycemia management using injectable insulin, there is an urgent need for the development of efficient oral insulin formulations. However, the gastrointestinal tract presents a formidable barrier to oral delivery of biologics. Here we report the development of a highly effective oral insulin formulation using choline and geranate (CAGE) ionic liquid. CAGE significantly enhanced paracellular transport of insulin, while protecting it from enzymatic degradation and by interacting with the mucus layer resulting in its thinning. In vivo, insulin-CAGE demonstrated exceptional pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic outcome after jejunal administration in rats. Low insulin doses (3 #8211;10 U/kg) brought about a significant decrease in blood glucose levels, which were sustained for longer periods (up to 12 hours), unlike s.c. injected insulin. When 10 U/kg insulin-CAGE was orally delivered in enterically coated capsules using an oral gavage, a sustained decrease in blood glucose of up to 45% was observed. The formulation exhibited high biocompatibility and was stable for 2 months at room temperature and for at least 4 months under refrigeration. Taken together, the results indicate that CAGE is a promising oral delivery vehicle and should be further explored for oral delivery of insulin and other biologics that are currently marketed as injectables.</TEXT>

This was the key finding of a new study published by the American Psychological Association. Journal Reference: Journal Reference: Stephanie M. Carlson et al. Cohort Effects in Children #8217;s Delay of Gratification. Developmental Psychology, 2018 DOI: 10.1037/dev0000533 Link: http://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fdev0000533 Abstract In the 1960s at Stanford University #8217;s Bing Preschool, children were given the option of taking an immediate, smaller reward or receiving a delayed, larger reward by waiting until the experimenter returned. Since then, the  #8220;Marshmallow Test #8221; has been used in numerous studies to assess delay of gratification. Yet, no prior study has compared the performance of children across the decades. Common wisdom suggests children today would wait less long, preferring immediate gratification. Study 1 confirmed this intuition in a survey of adults in the United States (N = 354; Mdn age = 34 years). To test the validity of this prediction, Study 2 analyzed the original data for average delay-of-gratification times (out of 10 min) of 840 typically developing U.S. children in three birth cohorts from similar middle-high socioeconomic backgrounds in the late 1960s, 1980s, and 2000s, matched on age (3 to 5 years) at the time of testing. In contrast to popular belief, results revealed a linear increase in delay over time (p  lt; .0001,  #951;p2 = .047), such that children in the 2000s waited on average 2 min longer than children in the 1960s, and 1 min longer than children in the 1980s. This pattern was robust with respect to age, sex, geography and sampling effects. We posit that increases in symbolic thought, technology, preschool education, and public attention to executive function skills have contributed to this finding, but caution that more research in diverse populations is needed to examine the generality of the findings and to identify causal factors.</TEXT>

P. vivax invades reticulocytes exclusively, and successful entry depends on specific interactions between the P. vivax reticulocyte-binding protein 2b (PvRBP2b) and transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1)2. TfR1-deficient erythroid cells are refractory to invasion by P. vivax, and anti-PvRBP2b monoclonal antibodies inhibit reticulocyte binding and block P. vivax invasion in field isolates2. Here we report a high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy structure of a ternary complex of PvRBP2b bound to human TfR1 and transferrin, at 3.7 #8201; #197; resolution. Mutational analyses show that PvRBP2b residues involved in complex formation are conserved; this suggests that antigens could be designed that act across P. vivax strains. Functional analyses of TfR1 highlight how P. vivax hijacks TfR1, an essential housekeeping protein, by binding to sites that govern host specificity, without affecting its cellular function of transporting iron. Crystal and solution structures of PvRBP2b in complex with antibody fragments characterize the inhibitory epitopes. Our results establish a structural framework for understanding how P. vivax reticulocyte-binding protein engages its receptor and the molecular mechanism of inhibitory monoclonal antibodies, providing important information for the design of novel vaccine candidates.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Journal Reference: Madhan R. Tirumalai, Victor G. Stepanov, Andrea W #252;nsche, Saied Montazari, Racquel O. Gonzalez, Kasturi Venkateswaran, George E. Fox. Bacillus safensis FO-36b and Bacillus pumilus SAFR-032: a whole genome comparison of two spacecraft assembly facility isolates. BMC Microbiology, 2018; 18 (1) DOI: 10.1186/s12866-018-1191-y Link: https://bmcmicrobiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12866-018-1191-y Abstract Background Bacillus strains producing highly resistant spores have been isolated from cleanrooms and space craft assembly facilities. Organisms that can survive such conditions merit planetary protection concern and if that resistance can be transferred to other organisms, a health concern too. To further efforts to understand these resistances, the complete genome of Bacillus safensis strain FO-36b, which produces spores resistant to peroxide and radiation was determined. The genome was compared to the complete genome of B. pumilus SAFR-032, and the draft genomes of B. safensis JPL-MERTA-8-2 and the type strain B. pumilus ATCC7061T. Additional comparisons were made to 61 draft genomes that have been mostly identified as strains of B. pumilus or B. safensis. Results The FO-36b gene order is essentially the same as that in SAFR-032 and other B. pumilus strains. The annotated genome has 3850 open reading frames and 40 noncoding RNAs and riboswitches. Of these, 307 are not shared by SAFR-032, and 65 are also not shared by MERTA and ATCC7061T. The FO-36b genome has ten unique open reading frames and two phage-like regions, homologous to the Bacillus bacteriophage SPP1 and Brevibacillus phage Jimmer1. Differing remnants of the Jimmer1 phage are found in essentially all B. safensis / B. pumilus strains. Seven unique genes are part of these phage elements. Whole Genome Phylogenetic Analysis of the B. pumilus, B. safensis and other Firmicutes genomes, separate them into three distinct clusters. Two clusters are subgroups of B. pumilus while one houses all the B. safensis strains. The Genome-genome distance analysis and a phylogenetic analysis of gyrA sequences corroborated these results. Conclusions It is not immediately obvious that the presence or absence of any specific gene or combination of genes is responsible for the variations in resistance seen. It is quite possible that distinctions in gene regulation can alter the expression levels of key proteins thereby changing the organism #8217;s resistance properties without gain or loss of a particular gene. What is clear is that phage elements contribute significantly to genome variability. Multiple genome comparison indicates that many strains named as B. pumilus likely belong to the B. safensis group.</TEXT>

Although postnatal depression has been thoroughly studied, the expression of maternal anger in the context of postnatal depression is conceptually unclear. This integrative review investigated the framing of anger in the context of postnatal depression. Methods After undertaking a search of CINAHL, Ovid #8208;Medline, PsycInfo, and Web of Science, we identified qualitative (n = 7) and quantitative (n = 17) papers that addressed maternal anger and postnatal depression. We analyzed the data by developing themes. Results Our review indicated that anger was a salient mood disturbance for some postnatally depressed women with themes integrated as: (i) anger accompanying depression, (ii) powerlessness as a component of depression and anger, and (iii) anger occurring as a result of expectations being violated. CONCLUSIONS Our findings indicate that anger can coexist with women #8217;s postnatal depression. Anger can be expressed toward the self and toward children and family members with negative relationship effects.

Baiocco, Roberto, PhD*; Carone, Nicola, PhD*; Ioverno, Salvatore, PhD #8224;; Lingiardi, Vittorio, MD #8225; Journal of Developmental  amp; Behavioral Pediatrics 2018 doi: 10.1097/DBP.0000000000000583 Link: https://journals.lww.com/jrnldbp/Abstract/publishahead/Same_Sex_and_Different_Sex_Parent_Families_in.99302.aspx?PRID=JDBP_PR_062818 Abstract Objective: Seventy gay fathers through surrogacy, 125 lesbian mothers through donor insemination, and 195 heterosexual parents through spontaneous conception, all with children aged 3 to 11 years and living in Italy, were compared on children's psychological adjustment and prosocial behavior, as well as parental self-efficacy, dyadic adjustment, family cohesion, and flexibility. Associations among family structures, family processes, and child health outcomes were also tested. Methods: Participants were matched for child characteristics. Self-report questionnaires were administered through an online survey to the parent who identified as most involved with the child on a day-to-day basis. Multivariate analyses of variance and multiple linear regressions were conducted. Results: Children of gay fathers and lesbian mothers were reported as showing fewer psychological problems than children of heterosexual parents. Irrespective of the family type, girls were reported as more prosocial than boys. With respect to parental dimensions, gay fathers described themselves as more competent and satisfied with their couple relationship than did heterosexual parents; they also reported higher levels of family cohesion and flexibility than did lesbian mothers and heterosexual parents. The effect of the family type was not predictive of child health outcomes once family process variables were taken into account. Conclusion: Findings suggested that children with same-sex parents fare well both in terms of psychological adjustment and prosocial behavior. The present study warns policy makers against making assumptions on the basis of sexual orientation about people who are more suited than others to be parents or about people who should or should not be denied access to fertility treatments.</TEXT>

We examined whether the emotion regulation strategies, cognitive reappraisal and distraction, influenced psychological state and prefrontal cortex oxygenation during endurance exercise. Twenty-four endurance runners ran for 90 min at 75 #8211;85% maximum heart rate in three separate sessions with no instruction or with instructions to use cognitive reappraisal or distraction. Participants rated their emotional arousal, emotional valence, and perceived exertion before, every 30 min during, and after exercise. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy quantified changes in prefrontal cortex oxygenation. Participants felt lower emotional arousal and physical exertion when instructed to utilize cognitive reappraisal than when given no emotion regulation instruction. Such responses to distraction did not differ from the other conditions. Emotion regulation strategies did not influence emotional valence or prefrontal cortex oxygenation. Participants #8217; analytical interpretation of the cognitive reappraisal instruction could contribute to small effect sizes and limited effects. Further research should determine contexts under which emotion regulation strategies most benefit endurance exercise experience.</TEXT>

Journal Reference: Genetic Options: The Impact of Genetic Ancestry Testing on Consumers #8217; Racial and Ethnic Identities Wendy D. Roth and Biorn Ivemark American Journal of Sociology 2018 124:1, 150-184 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1086/697487 Link: https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/697487 Abstract The rapid growth of genetic ancestry testing has brought concerns that these tests will transform consumers #8217; racial and ethnic identities, producing  #8220;geneticized #8221; identities determined by genetic knowledge. Drawing on 100 qualitative interviews with white, black, Hispanic/Latino, Asian, and Native Americans, the authors develop the genetic options theory to account for how genetic ancestry tests influence consumers #8217; ethnic and racial identities. The theory maintains that consumers do not accept the tests #8217; results as given but choose selectively from the estimates according to two mechanisms: their identity aspirations and social appraisals. Yet consumers #8217; prior racialization also influences their identity aspirations; white respondents aspired to new identities more readily and in substantively different ways. The authors #8217; findings suggest that genetic ancestry testing can reinforce race privilege among those who already experience it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Journal Reference: Yutong Shan, Gongjie Li. Obliquity Variations of Habitable Zone Planets Kepler-62f and Kepler-186f. The Astronomical Journal, 2018; 155 (6): 237 DOI: 10.3847/1538-3881/aabfd1 Link: http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-3881/aabfd1/meta Abstract Obliquity variability could play an important role in the climate and habitability of a planet. Orbital modulations caused by planetary companions and the planet's spin axis precession due to the torque from the host star may lead to resonant interactions and cause large-amplitude obliquity variability. Here we consider the spin axis dynamics of Kepler-62f and Kepler-186f, both of which reside in the habitable zone around their host stars. Using N-body simulations and secular numerical integrations, we describe their obliquity evolution for particular realizations of the planetary systems. We then use a generalized analytic framework to characterize regions in parameter space where the obliquity is variable with large amplitude. We find that the locations of variability are fine-tuned over the planetary properties and system architecture in the lower-obliquity regimes (lesssim40 #176;). As an example, assuming a rotation period of 24 hr, the obliquities of both Kepler-62f and Kepler-186f are stable below ~40 #176;, whereas the high-obliquity regions (60 #176; #8211;90 #176;) allow moderate variabilities. However, for some other rotation periods of Kepler-62f or Kepler-186f, the lower-obliquity regions could become more variable owing to resonant interactions. Even small deviations from coplanarity (e.g., mutual inclinations ~3 #176;) could stir peak-to-peak obliquity variations up to ~20 #176;. Undetected planetary companions and/or the existence of a satellite could also destabilize the low-obliquity regions. In all cases, the high-obliquity region allows for moderate variations, and all obliquities corresponding to retrograde motion (i.e.,  gt;90 #176;) are stable.</TEXT>

In this study, the effects of short-term estradiol-17 #946; (E2) exposure on various tissues of pregnant sows (F0) and on day 10 blastocysts (F1) were assessed. Intergenerational effects were investigated in the liver of 1-year old female offspring (F1). During gestation, sows were orally exposed to two low doses and a high dose of E2 (0.05, 10, and 1000 #8201; #181;g/kg body weight/day). In F0, perturbed tissue specific mRNA expression of cell cycle regulation and tumour suppressor genes was found at low and high dose exposure, being most pronounced in the endometrium and corpus luteum. The liver showed the most significant DNA hypomethylation in three target genes; CDKN2D, PSAT1, and RASSF1. For CDKN2D and PSAT1, differential methylation in blastocysts was similar as observed in the F0 liver. Whereas blastocysts showed hypomethylation, the liver of 1-year old offspring showed subtle, but significant hypermethylation. We show that the level of effect of estrogenic EDC, with the periconceptual period as a sensitive time window, is at much lower concentration than currently presumed and propose epigenetics as a sensitive novel risk assessment parameter.</TEXT>

Scientific Reports, 2018; 8 (1) DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-25831-9 Link: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25831-9 Abstract Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDC) interfere with the natural hormone balance and may induce epigenetic changes through exposure during sensitive periods of development. In this study, the effects of short-term estradiol-17 #946; (E2) exposure on various tissues of pregnant sows (F0) and on day 10 blastocysts (F1) were assessed. Intergenerational effects were investigated in the liver of 1-year old female offspring (F1). During gestation, sows were orally exposed to two low doses and a high dose of E2 (0.05, 10, and 1000 #8201; #181;g/kg body weight/day). In F0, perturbed tissue specific mRNA expression of cell cycle regulation and tumour suppressor genes was found at low and high dose exposure, being most pronounced in the endometrium and corpus luteum. The liver showed the most significant DNA hypomethylation in three target genes; CDKN2D, PSAT1, and RASSF1. For CDKN2D and PSAT1, differential methylation in blastocysts was similar as observed in the F0 liver. Whereas blastocysts showed hypomethylation, the liver of 1-year old offspring showed subtle, but significant hypermethylation. We show that the level of effect of estrogenic EDC, with the periconceptual period as a sensitive time window, is at much lower concentration than currently presumed and propose epigenetics as a sensitive novel risk assessment parameter.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Journal Reference: Erinn P. Fagan-Jeffries, Steven J.B. Cooper, Andrew D. Austin. Three new species of Dolichogenidea Viereck (Hymenoptera, Braconidae, Microgastrinae) from Australia with exceptionally long ovipositors. Journal of Hymenoptera Research, 2018; 64: 177 DOI: 10.3897/jhr.64.25219 Link: https://jhr.pensoft.net/articles.php?id=25219 Abstract The subfamily Microgastrinae contains an extraordinarily rich diversity of parasitoid wasps which parasitise larval lepidopterans. The Australian fauna has generally been poorly studied, particularly for the very speciose genera. One such genus is Dolichogenidea Vierek, which in Australia is known from only six described species. Here we describe three new species of Dolichogenidea from Australia, which are distinguished by possessing extremely long ovipositors compared with the typical form for the genus. These are D. finchi Fagan-Jeffries  amp; Austin, sp. n., D. mediocaudata Fagan-Jeffries  amp; Austin, sp. n., and D. xenomorph Fagan-Jeffries  amp; Austin, sp. n. In describing these new species we also discuss relationships within the genus, and the diversity and biology of the Australian fauna.</TEXT>

Link: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886918303647 Abstract: Existential isolation (EI) is the subjective experience of feeling fundamentally separate from other human beings. Recent studies examining EI have observed a consistent sex difference wherein men report higher levels of EI than women. Our first study used a large undergraduate survey. It replicated the sex difference in EI and showed that controlling for loneliness and self-esteem did not account for this difference. Study 2 replicated this pattern using an online sample, and tested the hypothesis that this difference may be mediated by the sex difference in endorsement of communal and agentic values. We found that sex differences in endorsement of communal (but not agentic) values mediated the sex difference in EI. However, agentic value endorsement played no role. These findings indicate that men may be higher in existential isolation because they do not endorse communal values as much as women do. This suggests that one way to reduce the disproportionate experience of EI among men may be to increase their endorsement of communal values.</TEXT>

We conducted the first meta-analysis examining the association between NNAI disorders and psychosis, and investigated the effect of (a) temporality (as determined by study design), (b) psychiatric diagnosis, and (c) specific autoimmune disorders. Methods Major databases were searched for articles published until April 2018. Thirty-one studies, comprising data for  gt;25 million individuals, were eligible. Using random effects models, we examined the overall association between all NNAI disorders and psychosis, rheumatoid arthritis was examined separately given the well-established negative association with psychosis. Stratified analyses investigated the effect of temporality, psychiatric diagnosis, and specific NNAI disorders. Results We observed a positive, overall association between NNAI disorders and psychosis (odds ratio = 1.26; 95% CI: 1.12 - 1.41) that was consistent across study designs and psychiatric diagnoses; however, considerable heterogeneity was detected (I2 = 88.09). Patterns varied across individual NNAI disorders; associations were positive for pernicious anaemia (1.91; 1.29 - 2.84), pemphigoid (1.90; 1.62 - 2.24), psoriasis (1.70; 1.51 - 1.91), coeliac disease (1.53; 1.12 - 2.10), and Graves #8217; disease (1.33; 1.03 - 1.72), and negative for ankylosing spondylitis (0.72; 0.54 - 0.98) and rheumatoid arthritis (0.65; 0.50 - 0.84). Conclusions Whilst we observed a positive, overall association between NNAI disorders and psychosis, this was not consistent across all NNAI disorders. Specific factors, including distinct inflammatory pathways, genetic influences, autoantibodies targeting brain proteins, or exposure to corticosteroid treatment, may therefore underlie this association.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The title of the post is a copy and paste from the first paragraph of the linked academic press release here :  gt; Adolescent drinking is associated with changes in the metabolite profile, a new study from the University of Eastern Finland and Kuopio University Hospital shows. Some of these changes were found to correlate with reduced brain grey matter volume, especially in young women who are heavy drinkers. Journal Reference: Noora Heikkinen, Olli K #228;rkk #228;inen, Eila Laukkanen, Virve Kekkonen, Outi Kaarre, Petri Kivim #228;ki, Mervi K #246;n #246;nen, Vidya Velagapudi, Jatin Nandania, Soili M. Lehto, Eini Niskanen, Ritva Vanninen, Tommi Tolmunen. Changes in the serum metabolite profile correlate with decreased brain grey matter volume in moderate-to-heavy-drinking young adults.

Abstract Our aim was to analyse metabolite profile changes in serum associated with moderate-to-heavy consumption of alcohol in young adults and to evaluate if these changes are connected to reduced brain grey matter volumes. Study population consisted of young adults with a ten-year history of moderate-to-heavy alcohol consumption (n = 35) and light-drinking controls (n = 27). We used targeted liquid chromatography mass spectrometry method to measure concentrations of metabolites in serum and 3.0 T magnetic resonance imaging to assess brain grey matter volumes. Alterations in amino acid and energy metabolism were observed in the moderate-to-heavy drinking young adults when compared to the controls. After correction for multiple testing, the group of moderate-to-heavy drinking young adults had increased serum concentrations of 1-methylhistamine (p = 0.001, d = 0.82) when compared to the controls. Furthermore, concentrations of 1-methylhistamine (r = -0.48, p = 0.004) and creatine (r = -0.52, p = 0.001) were negatively correlated with the brain grey matter volumes in the females. Overall, our results show association between moderate-to-heavy use of alcohol and altered metabolite profile in young adults as well as suggest that some of these changes could be associated with the reduced brain grey matter volume.</TEXT>

Abstract Our aim was to analyse metabolite profile changes in serum associated with moderate-to-heavy consumption of alcohol in young adults and to evaluate if these changes are connected to reduced brain grey matter volumes. Study population consisted of young adults with a ten-year history of moderate-to-heavy alcohol consumption (n = 35) and light-drinking controls (n = 27). We used targeted liquid chromatography mass spectrometry method to measure concentrations of metabolites in serum and 3.0 T magnetic resonance imaging to assess brain grey matter volumes. Alterations in amino acid and energy metabolism were observed in the moderate-to-heavy drinking young adults when compared to the controls. After correction for multiple testing, the group of moderate-to-heavy drinking young adults had increased serum concentrations of 1-methylhistamine (p = 0.001, d = 0.82) when compared to the controls. Furthermore, concentrations of 1-methylhistamine (r = -0.48, p = 0.004) and creatine (r = -0.52, p = 0.001) were negatively correlated with the brain grey matter volumes in the females.

Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking. 2018. DOI: https://doi.org/10.1089/cyber.2017.0608 Link: https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/cyber.2017.0608 Abstract The objective of this study was to investigate specific interpersonal communication motives that college students use to flirt through texting versus face to face (FtF). Four hundred college students (101 men, 299 women) were surveyed and reported using various communication motives to flirt using texting with a potential romantic partner. College students reported specific motives for flirting. Women reported flirting through text and FtF for pleasure motives significantly more than men, whereas men reported flirting for control and relaxation. In addition, men were more likely to flirt FtF for escape compared with women. Findings suggest that individuals are likely to flirt for pleasure if they are in a committed romantic relationship compared with those not in a committed relationship.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The title of the post is a copy and paste from the second paragraph of the linked academic press release here :  gt; A recent study by Brown et al (2018) published in BMC Psychiatry suggests that people struggling with binge eating are at an increased risk of suicide, with those at higher weights having the highest risk. Journal Reference: The relationship between body mass index, binge eating disorder and suicidality Kristal Lyn Brown, Jessica Gokee LaRose and Briana Mezuk BMC Psychiatry201818:196 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-018-1766-z Link: https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12888-018-1766-z Abstract Background While restrictive and compensatory eating disorders (e.g. anorexia and bulimia) are associated with elevated risk of suicide, less is known about binge eating disorder (BED). There is suggestive evidence of a U-shaped relationship between body mass index (BMI) and completed suicide, but fewer studies on suicidal ideation or attempts. This study examined the association between BED, BMI, and suicidality, and assessed whether these relationships varied by gender. Methods Data come from the Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiologic Surveys (N = #8201;14,497). Binge episodes and BED were assessed using the Composite International Diagnostic Inventory (CIDI). BMI was calculated from self-reported height and weight. Suicidal ideation/attempts were assessed using the CIDI. Weighted logistic regression was used to assess the association between binging/BED, BMI and suicidality. Interaction terms were used to assess whether the relationship between BMI and suicidality was moderated by binging/BED, and whether the relationships between binging/BED and BMI differed by gender. Results One-third of adults with BED had a history of suicidality, compared to 19% of those without. Both binging (OR: 1.95, 95% CI: 1.50 #8211;2.53) and BED (OR: 2.01, 95% CI: 1.41 #8211;2.86) were associated with suicidality in fully-adjusted models. BMI was associated with suicidality in a curvilinear manner, and this relationship was exacerbated by binging/BED (ORBinge eating x BMI: 1.04, 95% CI: 1.01 #8211;1.09, p  lt; #8201;0.05). The relationship between BMI and suicidality did not differ by gender (ORgender x BMI: 1.00, p  lt; #8201;0.770). However, the relationship between binge eating and suicidality was stronger for women relative to men (ORgender X binge: 1.87, p  lt; #8201;0.012). Conclusions Binge eating, even below the threshold for BED, is associated with suicidality. BMI is associated with suicidality in a curvilinear manner, and the BMI-suicidality relationship is potentiated by binge eating/BED. Findings support the thoughtful integration of psychiatric care into weight loss programs for adults with a history of binging behavior.</TEXT>

That #8217;s according to the largest study of its kind comparing a standard form of brain stimulation with a newer, shorter version that could potentially treat a larger percentage of depression patients. Journal Reference: Effectiveness of theta burst versus high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in patients with depression (THREE-D): a randomised non-inferiority trial Blumberger, Daniel M et al. The Lancet , Volume 391 , Issue 10131 , 1683 - 1692 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(18)30295-2 Link: https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(18)30295-2/fulltext Summary Background Treatment-resistant major depressive disorder is common; repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) by use of high-frequency (10 Hz) left-side dorsolateral prefrontal cortex stimulation is an evidence-based treatment for this disorder. Intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) is a newer form of rTMS that can be delivered in 3 min, versus 37 #183;5 min for a standard 10 Hz treatment session. We aimed to establish the clinical effectiveness, safety, and tolerability of iTBS compared with standard 10 Hz rTMS in adults with treatment-resistant depression. Methods In this randomized, multicentre, non-inferiority clinical trial, we recruited patients who were referred to specialty neurostimulation centres based at three Canadian university hospitals (Centre for Addiction and Mental Health and Toronto Western Hospital, Toronto, ON, and University of British Columbia Hospital, Vancouver, BC). Participants were aged 18 #8211;65 years, were diagnosed with a current treatment-resistant major depressive episode or could not tolerate at least two antidepressants in the current episode, were receiving stable antidepressant medication doses for at least 4 weeks before baseline, and had an HRSD-17 score of at least 18. Participants were randomly allocated (1:1) to treatment groups (10 Hz rTMS or iTBS) by use of a random permuted block method, with stratification by site and number of adequate trials in which the antidepressants were unsuccessful. Treatment was delivered open-label but investigators and outcome assessors were masked to treatment groups. Participants were treated with 10 Hz rTMS or iTBS to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, administered on 5 days a week for 4 #8211;6 weeks. The primary outcome measure was change in 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD-17) score, with a non-inferiority margin of 2 #183;25 points. For the primary outcome measure, we did a per-protocol analysis of all participants who were randomly allocated to groups and who attained the primary completion point of 4 weeks. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01887782. Findings Between Sept 3, 2013, and Oct 3, 2016, we randomly allocated 205 participants to receive 10 Hz rTMS and 209 participants to receive iTBS. 192 (94%) participants in the 10 Hz rTMS group and 193 (92%) in the iTBS group were assessed for the primary outcome after 4 #8211;6 weeks of treatment. HRSD-17 scores improved from 23 #183;5 (SD 4 #183;4) to 13 #183;4 (7 #183;8) in the 10 Hz rTMS group and from 23 #183;6 (4 #183;3) to 13 #183;4 (7 #183;9) in the iTBS group (adjusted difference 0 #183;103, lower 95% CI  #8722;1 #183;16; p=0 #183;0011), which indicated non-inferiority of iTBS. Self-rated intensity of pain associated with treatment was greater in the iTBS group than in the 10 Hz rTMS group (mean score on verbal analogue scale 3 #183;8 [SD 2 #183;0] vs 3 #183;4 [2 #183;0] out of 10; p=0 #183;011). Dropout rates did not differ between groups (10 Hz rTMS: 13 [6%] of 205 participants; iTBS: 16 [8%] of 209 participants); p=0 #183;6004). The most common treatment-related adverse event was headache in both groups (10 Hz rTMS: 131 [64%] of 204; iTBS: 136 [65%] of 208). Interpretation In patients with treatment-resistant depression, iTBS was non-inferior to 10 Hz rTMS for the treatment of depression. Both treatments had low numbers of dropouts and similar side-effects, safety, and tolerability profiles. By use of iTBS, the number of patients treated per day with current rTMS devices can be increased several times without compromising clinical effectiveness.

Treatment was delivered open-label but investigators and outcome assessors were masked to treatment groups. Participants were treated with 10 Hz rTMS or iTBS to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, administered on 5 days a week for 4 #8211;6 weeks. The primary outcome measure was change in 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD-17) score, with a non-inferiority margin of 2 #183;25 points. For the primary outcome measure, we did a per-protocol analysis of all participants who were randomly allocated to groups and who attained the primary completion point of 4 weeks. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01887782. Findings Between Sept 3, 2013, and Oct 3, 2016, we randomly allocated 205 participants to receive 10 Hz rTMS and 209 participants to receive iTBS. 192 (94%) participants in the 10 Hz rTMS group and 193 (92%) in the iTBS group were assessed for the primary outcome after 4 #8211;6 weeks of treatment. HRSD-17 scores improved from 23 #183;5 (SD 4 #183;4) to 13 #183;4 (7 #183;8) in the 10 Hz rTMS group and from 23 #183;6 (4 #183;3) to 13 #183;4 (7 #183;9) in the iTBS group (adjusted difference 0 #183;103, lower 95% CI  #8722;1 #183;16; p=0 #183;0011), which indicated non-inferiority of iTBS. Self-rated intensity of pain associated with treatment was greater in the iTBS group than in the 10 Hz rTMS group (mean score on verbal analogue scale 3 #183;8 [SD 2 #183;0] vs 3 #183;4 [2 #183;0] out of 10; p=0 #183;011). Dropout rates did not differ between groups (10 Hz rTMS: 13 [6%] of 205 participants; iTBS: 16 [8%] of 209 participants); p=0 #183;6004). The most common treatment-related adverse event was headache in both groups (10 Hz rTMS: 131 [64%] of 204; iTBS: 136 [65%] of 208). Interpretation In patients with treatment-resistant depression, iTBS was non-inferior to 10 Hz rTMS for the treatment of depression. Both treatments had low numbers of dropouts and similar side-effects, safety, and tolerability profiles. By use of iTBS, the number of patients treated per day with current rTMS devices can be increased several times without compromising clinical effectiveness.

    <TEXT>The title of the post is a copy and paste from the first paragraph of the linked academic press release here :  gt; Sessions of magnetic brain stimulation therapy lasting just over three minutes significantly reduced depression symptoms in patients with treatment-resistant depression. That #8217;s according to the largest study of its kind comparing a standard form of brain stimulation with a newer, shorter version that could potentially treat a larger percentage of depression patients. Journal Reference: Effectiveness of theta burst versus high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in patients with depression (THREE-D): a randomised non-inferiority trial Blumberger, Daniel M et al. The Lancet , Volume 391 , Issue 10131 , 1683 - 1692 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(18)30295-2 Link: https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(18)30295-2/fulltext Summary Background Treatment-resistant major depressive disorder is common; repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) by use of high-frequency (10 Hz) left-side dorsolateral prefrontal cortex stimulation is an evidence-based treatment for this disorder. Intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) is a newer form of rTMS that can be delivered in 3 min, versus 37 #183;5 min for a standard 10 Hz treatment session. We aimed to establish the clinical effectiveness, safety, and tolerability of iTBS compared with standard 10 Hz rTMS in adults with treatment-resistant depression. Methods In this randomized, multicentre, non-inferiority clinical trial, we recruited patients who were referred to specialty neurostimulation centres based at three Canadian university hospitals (Centre for Addiction and Mental Health and Toronto Western Hospital, Toronto, ON, and University of British Columbia Hospital, Vancouver, BC). Participants were aged 18 #8211;65 years, were diagnosed with a current treatment-resistant major depressive episode or could not tolerate at least two antidepressants in the current episode, were receiving stable antidepressant medication doses for at least 4 weeks before baseline, and had an HRSD-17 score of at least 18.

Using independent expert ratings of 794 body camera videos of 164 police officers across two agencies, I show that a lack of perceived public understanding decreases task performance for liberal-leaning officers but not for conservative-leaning officers. Because liberal-leaning officers seek to form more communal relationships with the public, a perceived lack of public understanding violates their sense of social order, but it merely reaffirms conservative-leaning officers #8217; beliefs in maintaining an authoritarian distance given the responsibilities and duties they shoulder. I replicate these results using supervisors #8217; ratings of 82 officers across four agencies and then demonstrate in a time-lagged survey of 184 officers in a single agency that those with stronger conservative beliefs are more likely to believe the public fails to appreciate the difficulties of their jobs.

    <TEXT>The title of the post is a copy and paste from the first and fifth paragraphs of the linked academic press release here :  gt; Cheetahs are the rarest of the larger cat species in Africa. The researchers demonstrated that cheetah males in Africa display two spatial tactics: floaters roam over vast areas whereas territory holders mark and defend small areas.  gt; Floating and territory holding are therefore associated with different life-history stages  #8211; adult males become first floaters before they may succeed to obtain a territory. Journal Reference: Joerg Melzheimer, Sabrina Streif, Bernd Wasiolka, Manuela Fischer, Susanne Thalwitzer, Sonja K. Heinrich, Annika Weigold, Heribert Hofer, Bettina Wachter. Queuing, takeovers, and becoming a fat cat: Long-term data reveal two distinct male spatial tactics at different life-history stages in Namibian cheetahs. Ecosphere, 2018; 9 (6): e02308 DOI: 10.1002/ecs2.2308 Link: https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ecs2.2308 Abstract In mammals, male spatial tactics and sociality can be predicted from the size, degree of overlap and ease of defense of female individual or group home ranges (HRs). An exception is apparently the cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) for which studies from East Africa describe a socio #8208;spatial organization where resident males defend small territories, which cover a portion of large ranges of solitary females, and non #8208;territorial males (floaters) roam over vast areas whilst queuing for access to territories. Most studies from southern Africa did not report the existence of territorial males and floaters, but a system with both males and females roaming over vast areas with overlapping HRs. Here, we derive and test predictions from previously described spatial tactics in felids by studying the movements, behavior, and/or physical characteristics of 164 radio #8208;collared Namibian cheetahs on commercial farmland from 2002 to 2014. The results demonstrate the existence of male territory holders and floaters and a, by mammalian standards, unique sociality in that commonly groups of males, sometimes solitary males defended small areas partially overlapping with large ranges of solitary females. When a solitary male or a group of males switched between both tactics, floating usually preceded territory holding, suggesting that both spatial phases are equivalent to distinct life #8208;history stages. Switching from roaming as a floater to holding a territory was also associated with an increase in body mass index (BMI) and a change in the observed behavior of animals captured in traps when approached by humans. Both BMI and this behavior are therefore reliable, quick biomarkers of an individual's space use tactic and life #8208;history stage. We elaborate the implications of this socio #8208;spatial organization for models of ecological movements and on conflict mitigation measures such as translocations or the planning of future protected areas. We suggest that such implications also apply to other species where one sex exhibits two space use tactics and two sets of range sizes.</TEXT>

The evidence provides cumulative support for the reality of psi, which cannot be readily explained away by the quality of the studies, fraud, selective reporting, experimental or analytical incompetence, or other frequent criticisms. The evidence for psi is comparable to that for established phenomena in psychology and other disciplines, although there is no consensual understanding of them. The article concludes with recommendations for further progress in the field including the use of project and data repositories, conducting multidisciplinary studies with enough power, developing further nonconscious measures of psi and falsifiable theories, analyzing the characteristics of successful sessions and participants, improving the ecological validity of studies, testing how to increase effect sizes, recruiting more researchers at least open to the possibility of psi, and situating psi phenomena within larger domains such as the study of consciousness.

Phaethon is also an active asteroid with a very blue spectrum. We conducted polarimetric observations of this asteroid over a wide range of solar phase angles  #945; during its close approach to the Earth in autumn 2016. Our observation revealed that Phaethon exhibits extremely large linear polarization: P #8201;= #8201;50.0 #8201; #177; #8201;1.1% at  #945; #8201;= #8201;106.5 #176;, and its maximum is even larger. The strong polarization implies that Phaethon #8217;s geometric albedo is lower than the current estimate obtained through radiometric observation. This possibility stems from the potential uncertainty in Phaethon #8217;s absolute magnitude. An alternative possibility is that relatively large grains (~300 #8201; #956;m in diameter, presumably due to extensive heating near its perihelion) dominate this asteroid #8217;s surface. In addition, the asteroid #8217;s surface porosity, if it is substantially large, can also be an effective cause of this polarization.</TEXT>

The objective of this study was to characterize pain intensity following opioid discontinuation over 12 months. This retrospective VA administrative data study identified N=551 patients nationally who discontinued LTOT. Data over 24 months (12 months prior to and following discontinuation) were abstracted from VA administrative records. Random effects regression analyses examined changes in 0-10 pain numeric rating scale scores over time, while growth mixture models delineated pain trajectory sub-groups. Mean estimated pain at the time of opioid discontinuation was 4.9. Changes in pain following discontinuation were characterized by slight but statistically non-significant declines in pain intensity over 12 months post-discontinuation (B=-0.20, p=0.14). Follow-up growth mixture models identified four pain trajectory classes characterized by the following post-discontinuation pain levels: no pain (average pain at discontinuation=0.37), mild clinically-significant pain (average pain=3.90), moderate clinically-significant pain (average pain=6.33), and severe clinically-significant pain (average pain=8.23). Similar to the overall sample, pain trajectories in each of the four classes were characterized by slight reductions in pain over time, with patients in the mild and moderate pain trajectory categories experiencing the greatest pain reductions post-discontinuation (B=-0.11, p=0.05 and B=-0.11, p=0.04, respectively). Pain intensity following discontinuation of LTOT does not, on average, worsen for patients and may slightly improve, particularly for patients with mild-to-moderate pain at the time of discontinuation. Clinicians should consider these findings when discussing risks of opioid therapy and potential benefits of opioid taper with patients.</TEXT>

To examine associations of leisure-time sitting with risk of specific causes of death, data were analyzed from the CPS-II Nutrition Cohort, a prospective U.S. cohort including 127,554 men and women who were free of major chronic disease at study entry and among whom 48,784 died during 21 years of follow-up (1993-2014; median=20.3 years, IQR=4.6 years). After multivariable adjustment, prolonged leisure-time sitting (6+ vs  lt;3 hours/day) was associated with higher risk of all-cause, cardiovascular disease (including coronary heart disease and stroke-specific mortality), cancer, diabetes, kidney disease, suicide, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pneumonitis due to solids and liquids, liver and other digestive disease, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, nervous disorders, and musculoskeletal disorders mortality. These findings provide additional evidence for associations between a broad range of mortality outcomes and prolonged sitting time.

    <TEXT>The title of the post is a copy and paste from the first paragraph of the linked academic press release here :  gt; Stimulating the prefrontal cortex, the part of the brain responsible for controlling complex ideas and behaviors, can reduce a person #8217;s intention to commit a violent act by more than 50 percent, according to research from the University of Pennsylvania and Nanyang Technological University published in the Journal of Neuroscience. What #8217;s more, using such a minimally invasive technique, called transcranial direct-current stimulation, increased the perception that acts of physical and sexual assault were morally wrong. Journal Reference: Stimulation of the Prefrontal Cortex Reduces Intentions to Commit Aggression: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Stratified, Parallel-Group Trial Olivia Choy, Adrian Raine and Roy H. Hamilton Journal of Neuroscience 2 July 2018, 3317-17; DOI: https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3317-17.2018 Link: http://www.jneurosci.org/content/early/2018/07/02/JNEUROSCI.3317-17.2018 Abstract Although prefrontal brain impairments are one of the best-replicated brain imaging findings in relation to aggression, little is known about the causal role of this brain region. This study tests whether stimulating the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) reduces the likelihood of engaging in aggressive acts, and the mechanism underlying this relationship. In a double-blind, stratified, placebo-controlled, randomized trial, 81 human adults (36 males, 45 females) were randomly assigned to an active (N = 39) or placebo (N = 42) condition, and followed up one day after the experiment session.

    <TEXT>Pre-print reference: Van Bavel, J. J. (2018, June 27). Rethinking the  #8216;nature #8217; of brutality: Uncovering the role of identity leadership in the Stanford Prison Experiment. DOI: https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/b7crx Link: https://psyarxiv.com/b7crx/ Abstract On the basis of findings from the Stanford Prison Experiment (SPE), Zimbardo and colleagues (e.g., Haney, Banks  amp; Zimbardo, 1973) have argued that people #8217;s willingness to oppress others  #8212; whether in the world at large or in classic social psychological studies  #8212; is the result of a tendency to conform  #8216;naturally #8217; to brutal roles. In contrast, Haslam and Reicher (e.g., 2007) have argued that it results from leadership which encourages potential perpetrators to identify with what is presented as a noble ingroup cause and to see their actions as necessary for the advancement of that cause. We review a range of evidence to show that such an analysis explains other classic studies of toxic behaviour (e.g. Milgram #8217;s obedience studies). Nevertheless, researchers have hitherto had limited capacity to establish whether analysis framed in terms of identity leadership can account for brutality in the SPE. This has changed following the recent digitization of the SPE archive. Using recordings from the archive we show how the experimenters directly intervened to persuade Guards to adopt their roles and to act tough. Moreover, we show how these interventions accord with the tenets of identity leadership. Implications for the analysis of conformity, the understanding of brutality and the interpretation of the SPE are discussed.</TEXT>

A hybrid terrestrial-aquatic robot with similar capabilities requires multimodal locomotive strategies that reconcile the constraints imposed by the different environments. Here we report the development of a 1.6 #8201;g quadrupedal microrobot that can walk on land, swim on water, and transition between the two. This robot utilizes a combination of surface tension and buoyancy to support its weight and generates differential drag using passive flaps to swim forward and turn. Electrowetting is used to break the water surface and transition into water by reducing the contact angle, and subsequently inducing spontaneous wetting. Finally, several design modifications help the robot overcome surface tension and climb a modest incline to transition back onto land. Our results show that microrobots can demonstrate unique locomotive capabilities by leveraging their small size, mesoscale fabrication methods, and surface effects.</TEXT>

Abstract: Feeling time-pressed has become ubiquitous. Time management strategies have emerged to help individuals fit in more of their desired and necessary activities. We provide a review of these strategies. In doing so, we distinguish between two, often competing, motives people have in managing their time: activity maximization and outcome maximization. The emerging literature points to an important dilemma: a given strategy that maximizes the number of activities might be detrimental to outcome maximization. We discuss such factors that might hinder performance in work tasks and enjoyment in leisure tasks.

NLY01 also prolongs the life and reduces the behavioral deficits and neuropathological abnormalities in the human A53T  #945;-synuclein (hA53T) transgenic mouse model of  #945;-synucleinopathy-induced neurodegeneration16. We found that NLY01 is a potent GLP1R agonist with favorable properties that is neuroprotective through the direct prevention of microglial-mediated conversion of astrocytes to an A1 neurotoxic phenotype. In light of its favorable properties, NLY01 should be evaluated in the treatment of Parkinson #8217;s disease and related neurologic disorders characterized by microglial activation.</TEXT>

In light of its favorable properties, NLY01 should be evaluated in the treatment of Parkinson #8217;s disease and related neurologic disorders characterized by microglial activation.</TEXT>

Just kidding! :) Seriously, the definition: The use of special strains of mice to study a human disease or condition, and how to prevent and treat it. Source: https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/mouse-model So not just any live mice, but mice bred to have a model of a human disease, in this case, mice with human-like Parkinson #8217;s disease, that we can test treatments on, before we move on to human clinical trials.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Reference: One-Shot Imitation from Observing Humans via Domain-Adaptive Meta-Learning Tianhe Yu, Chelsea Finn, Annie Xie, Sudeep Dasari, Tianhao Zhang, Pieter Abbeel, Sergey Levine Humans and animals are capable of learning a new behavior by observing others perform the skill just once. We consider the problem of allowing a robot to do the same -- learning from a raw video pixels of a human, even when there is substantial domain shift in the perspective, environment, and embodiment between the robot and the observed human. Prior approaches to this problem have hand-specified how human and robot actions correspond and often relied on explicit human pose detection systems. In this work, we present an approach for one-shot learning from a video of a human by using human and robot demonstration data from a variety of previous tasks to build up prior knowledge through meta-learning. Then, combining this prior knowledge and only a single video demonstration from a human, the robot can perform the task that the human demonstrated. We show experiments on both a PR2 arm and a Sawyer arm, demonstrating that after meta-learning, the robot can learn to place, push, and pick-and-place new objects using just one video of a human performing the manipulation.

Journal Reference: The effects of  #8220;phubbing #8221; on social interaction Varoth Chotpitayasunondh Karen M. Douglas DOI: https://doi.org/10.1111/jasp.12506 Link: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jasp.12506 Abstract This research experimentally investigated the social consequences of  #8220;phubbing #8221;  #8211; the act of snubbing someone in a social setting by concentrating on one's mobile phone. Participants viewed a three #8208;minute animation in which they imagined themselves as part of a dyadic conversation. Their communication partner either phubbed them extensively, partially, or not at all. Results revealed that increased phubbing significantly and negatively affected perceived communication quality and relationship satisfaction. These effects were mediated by reduced feelings of belongingness and both positive and negative affect. This research underlines the importance of phubbing as a modern social phenomenon to be further investigated.</TEXT>

People with exposure to solvents who also carry the genes that make them more susceptible to MS are nearly seven times as likely to develop the disease as people with no solvent exposure who do not carry the MS genes. Journal Reference: Anna Karin Hedstr #246;m, Ola H #246;ssjer, Michail Katsoulis, Ingrid Kockum, Tomas Olsson, Lars Alfredsson. Organic solvents and MS susceptibility Interaction with MS risk HLA genes. Neurology, 2018 DOI: 10.1212/WNL.0000000000005906 Link: http://n.neurology.org/content/early/2018/07/03/WNL.0000000000005906 Abstract Objective We hypothesize that different sources of lung irritation may contribute to elicit an immune reaction in the lungs and subsequently lead to multiple sclerosis (MS) in people with a genetic susceptibility to the disease. We aimed to investigate the influence of exposure to organic solvents on MS risk, and a potential interaction between organic solvents and MS risk human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes. Methods Using a Swedish population-based case-control study (2,042 incident cases of MS and 2,947 controls), participants with different genotypes, smoking habits, and exposures to organic solvents were compared regarding occurrence of MS, by calculating odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals using logistic regression. A potential interaction between exposure to organic solvents and MS risk HLA genes was evaluated by calculating the attributable proportion due to interaction. Results Overall, exposure to organic solvents increased the risk of MS (odds ratio 1.5, 95% confidence interval 1.2 #8211;1.8, p = 0.0004). Among both ever and never smokers, an interaction between organic solvents, carriage of HLA-DRB1*15, and absence of HLA-A*02 was observed with regard to MS risk, similar to the previously reported gene-environment interaction involving the same MS risk HLA genes and smoke exposure. Conclusion The mechanism linking both smoking and exposure to organic solvents to MS risk may involve lung inflammation with a proinflammatory profile. Their interaction with MS risk HLA genes argues for an action of these environmental factors on adaptive immunity, perhaps through activation of autoaggressive cells resident in the lungs subsequently attacking the CNS.</TEXT>

Published 2 July 2018 Link: http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/373/1753/20170239 Abstract Organizations #8217; pursuit of increased workplace collaboration has led managers to transform traditional office spaces into  #8216;open #8217;, transparency-enhancing architectures with fewer walls, doors and other spatial boundaries, yet there is scant direct empirical research on how human interaction patterns change as a result of these architectural changes. In two intervention-based field studies of corporate headquarters transitioning to more open office spaces, we empirically examined #8212;using digital data from advanced wearable devices and from electronic communication servers #8212;the effect of open office architectures on employees' face-to-face, email and instant messaging (IM) interaction patterns. Contrary to common belief, the volume of face-to-face interaction decreased significantly (approx. 70%) in both cases, with an associated increase in electronic interaction. In short, rather than prompting increasingly vibrant face-to-face collaboration, open architecture appeared to trigger a natural human response to socially withdraw from officemates and interact instead over email and IM. This is the first study to empirically measure both face-to-face and electronic interaction before and after the adoption of open office architecture. The results inform our understanding of the impact on human behaviour of workspaces that trend towards fewer spatial boundaries.</TEXT>

Published 2 July 2018 Link: http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/373/1753/20170239 Abstract Organizations #8217; pursuit of increased workplace collaboration has led managers to transform traditional office spaces into  #8216;open #8217;, transparency-enhancing architectures with fewer walls, doors and other spatial boundaries, yet there is scant direct empirical research on how human interaction patterns change as a result of these architectural changes. In two intervention-based field studies of corporate headquarters transitioning to more open office spaces, we empirically examined #8212;using digital data from advanced wearable devices and from electronic communication servers #8212;the effect of open office architectures on employees' face-to-face, email and instant messaging (IM) interaction patterns. Contrary to common belief, the volume of face-to-face interaction decreased significantly (approx. 70%) in both cases, with an associated increase in electronic interaction. In short, rather than prompting increasingly vibrant face-to-face collaboration, open architecture appeared to trigger a natural human response to socially withdraw from officemates and interact instead over email and IM. This is the first study to empirically measure both face-to-face and electronic interaction before and after the adoption of open office architecture. The results inform our understanding of the impact on human behaviour of workspaces that trend towards fewer spatial boundaries.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Journal Reference: Psychopathic traits associated with abnormal hemodynamic activity in salience and default mode networks during auditory oddball task Anderson, N.E., Maurer, J.M., Steele, V.R. et al. Cogn Affect Behav Neurosci (2018) 18: 564. DOI: https://doi.org/10.3758/s13415-018-0588-2 Link: https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13415-018-0588-2 Abstract Psychopathy is a personality disorder accompanied by abnormalities in emotional processing and attention. Recent theoretical applications of network-based models of cognition have been used to explain the diverse range of abnormalities apparent in psychopathy. Still, the physiological basis for these abnormalities is not well understood. A significant body of work has examined psychopathy-related abnormalities in simple attention-based tasks, but these studies have largely been performed using electrocortical measures, such as event-related potentials (ERPs), and they often have been carried out among individuals with low levels of psychopathic traits. In this study, we examined neural activity during an auditory oddball task using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during a simple auditory target detection (oddball) task among 168 incarcerated adult males, with psychopathic traits assessed via the Hare Psychopathy Checklist-Revised (PCL-R). Event-related contrasts demonstrated that the largest psychopathy-related effects were apparent between the frequent standard stimulus condition and a task-off, implicit baseline. Negative correlations with interpersonal-affective dimensions (Factor 1) of the PCL-R were apparent in regions comprising default mode and salience networks. These findings support models of psychopathy describing impaired integration across functional networks. They additionally corroborate reports which have implicated failures of efficient transition between default mode and task-positive networks. Finally, they demonstrate a neurophysiological basis for abnormal mobilization of attention and reduced engagement with stimuli that have little motivational significance among those with high psychopathic traits.</TEXT>

Universality of free fall from the orbital motion of a pulsar in a stellar triple system. Nature, 2018; 559 (7712): 73 DOI: 10.1038/s41586-018-0265-1 Link: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0265-1 Abstract Einstein #8217;s theory of gravity #8212;the general theory of relativity1 #8212;is based on the universality of free fall, which specifies that all objects accelerate identically in an external gravitational field. In contrast to almost all alternative theories of gravity2, the strong equivalence principle of general relativity requires universality of free fall to apply even to bodies with strong self-gravity. Direct tests of this principle using Solar System bodies3,4 are limited by the weak self-gravity of the bodies, and tests using pulsar #8211;white-dwarf binaries5,6 have been limited by the weak gravitational pull of the Milky Way. PSR J0337+1715 is a hierarchical system of three stars (a stellar triple system) in which a binary consisting of a millisecond radio pulsar and a white dwarf in a 1.6-day orbit is itself in a 327-day orbit with another white dwarf. This system permits a test that compares how the gravitational pull of the outer white dwarf affects the pulsar, which has strong self-gravity, and the inner white dwarf. Here we report that the accelerations of the pulsar and its nearby white-dwarf companion differ fractionally by no more than 2.6  #215; 10 #8722;6. For a rough comparison, our limit on the strong-field Nordtvedt parameter, which measures violation of the universality of free fall, is a factor of ten smaller than that obtained from (weak-field) Solar System tests3,4 and a factor of almost a thousand smaller than that obtained from other strong-field tests5,6.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Journal Reference: N. Zhang, M. Fard, M.H.U. Bhuiyan, D. Verhagen, M. F. Azari, S. R. Robinson. The Effects of Physical Vibration on Heart Rate Variability as a Measure of Drowsiness. Ergonomics, 2018; 1 DOI: 10.1080/00140139.2018.1482373 Link: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00140139.2018.1482373 Abstract We investigated the effects of low frequency whole body vibration on heart rate variability (HRV), a measure of autonomic nervous system activation that differentiates between stress and drowsiness. Fifteen participants underwent two simulated driving tasks for 60 #8201;minutes each: one involved whole-body 4-7 #8201;Hz vibration delivered through the car seat, and one involved no vibration. The Karolinska Sleepiness Scale, a subjective measure of drowsiness, demonstrated a significant increase in drowsiness during the task. Within 15-30 #8201;minutes of exposure to vibration, autonomic (sympathetic) activity increased (p  lt; 0.01) in response to the stress of maintaining alertness and performance when drowsy, and peaked at 60 #8201;minutes (p  lt; 0.001). Changes in three other HRV domains (higher LF/HF ratios, lower RMSSD (ms), and pNN50 (%) values) were consistent with increased sympathetic activation.

    <TEXT>Journal Reference: N. Zhang, M. Fard, M.H.U. Bhuiyan, D. Verhagen, M. F. Azari, S. R. Robinson. The Effects of Physical Vibration on Heart Rate Variability as a Measure of Drowsiness. Ergonomics, 2018; 1 DOI: 10.1080/00140139.2018.1482373 Link: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00140139.2018.1482373 Abstract We investigated the effects of low frequency whole body vibration on heart rate variability (HRV), a measure of autonomic nervous system activation that differentiates between stress and drowsiness. Fifteen participants underwent two simulated driving tasks for 60 #8201;minutes each: one involved whole-body 4-7 #8201;Hz vibration delivered through the car seat, and one involved no vibration. The Karolinska Sleepiness Scale, a subjective measure of drowsiness, demonstrated a significant increase in drowsiness during the task. Within 15-30 #8201;minutes of exposure to vibration, autonomic (sympathetic) activity increased (p  lt; 0.01) in response to the stress of maintaining alertness and performance when drowsy, and peaked at 60 #8201;minutes (p  lt; 0.001). Changes in three other HRV domains (higher LF/HF ratios, lower RMSSD (ms), and pNN50 (%) values) were consistent with increased sympathetic activation. These findings have implications for the future development of equivalent drowsiness contours leading to improvements in road safety. Practitioner Summary: The effects of physical vibration on driver drowsiness have not been well investigated. This laboratory-controlled study found characteristic changes in heart rate variability (HRV) domains that indicated progressively increasing neurological effort in maintaining alertness in response to low frequency vibration, which became significant within 30 #8201;minutes.</TEXT>

For those using cannabis, extracts were analysed for cannabinoid content, with specific comparison of samples rated by families as  #8220;effective #8221; versus those rated  #8220;ineffective #8221;. Results showed that children given cannabis extracts tended to have more severe epilepsy historically and had trialled more anticonvulsants than those who had never received cannabis extracts. There was high variability in the cannabinoid content and profile of cannabis extracts rated as  #8220;effective #8221;, with no clear differences between extracts perceived as  #8220;effective #8221; and  #8220;ineffective #8221;. Contrary to family #8217;s expectations, most samples contained low concentrations of cannabidiol, while  #916;9-tetrahydrocannabinol was present in nearly every sample.

Materials  amp; methods: Nanofibrous wound dressings containing 1,25(OH)2D3 were successfully prepared by electrospinning, which were examined in vitro, in vivo and ex vivo. Results: 1,25(OH)2D3 was successfully loaded into nanofibers with encapsulation efficiency larger than 90%. 1,25(OH)2D3 showed a sustained release from nanofibers over 4 weeks. Treatment of U937 and HaCaT cells with 1,25(OH)2D3-loaded poly( #1013;-caprolactone) nanofibers significantly induced hCAP18/LL37 expression in monocytes and keratinocytes, skin wounds of humanized transgenic mice and artificial wounds of human skin explants. Conclusion: 1,25(OH)2D3 containing nanofibrous dressings could enhance innate immunity by inducing antimicrobial peptide production.</TEXT>

Link: http://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Ffam0000440 Abstract Matching theories of social support suggest that receiving the amount and type of support one prefers from one's romantic partner promotes more favorable affect and higher relationship satisfaction. Individuals who feel they are provided with less support from their partner than they desire (underprovision) generally experience less positive affect, more negative affect, and tend to be less satisfied in their relationships. However, research findings are mixed with regard to whether receiving more of a particular type of support from one's partner than one desires (overprovision) is associated with more favorable affect and higher relationship satisfaction. The purpose of the present study was to examine whether underprovision and overprovision of two theoretically important types of social support from spouses-emotional or informational support-were associated with more favorable affect and higher relationship satisfaction in a sample of newlywed couples. Participants were 114 newlywed couples. Data were analyzed using Actor-Partner Interdependence Moderation Models. Results suggested that receiving more emotional support was associated with more favorable affect and higher relationship satisfaction regardless of support preferences. Also, wives who received more informational support from their husbands had higher relationship satisfaction regardless of support preferences. In contrast to findings for relationship satisfaction, the association between informational support and affect were consistent with matching hypotheses. Husbands who experienced underprovision of informational support from their wives, experienced less favorable affect. In contrast, wives who experienced overprovision of informational support from their husbands experienced higher depressive symptoms. Implications for research, theory, and practice are discussed.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It #8217;s quite nuanced. In general men are okay with informational support, but also like emotional support too. From the linked article:  gt; Another finding was that wives wanted more support of all kinds than they received #8212;both emotional and informational support. Husbands also wanted more emotional support than they received but were okay with the informational support they received. And here:  gt; The next finding was subtle, but quite important. Among the subset of husbands who preferred informational support, the more informational support they got the better they felt.  gt; But among the subset of wives who do not prefer informational support, the more informational support they got the worse they felt. Hence why the researchers say to default to providing emotional support, as that is always positive, regardless of preference. From the article:  gt; Luckily the solution is simple #8212;and it totally agrees with the study #8217;s conclusion. Default to emotional support. If you have no other information, give emotional support.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Preprint reference: Life Versus Dark Energy: How An Advanced Civilization Could Resist the Accelerating Expansion of the Universe Dan Hooper The presence of dark energy in our universe is causing space to expand at an accelerating rate. As a result, over the next approximately 100 billion years, all stars residing beyond the Local Group will fall beyond the cosmic horizon and become not only unobservable, but entirely inaccessible, thus limiting how much energy could one day be extracted from them. Here, we consider the likely response of a highly advanced civilization to this situation. In particular, we argue that in order to maximize its access to useable energy, a sufficiently advanced civilization would chose to expand rapidly outward, build Dyson Spheres or similar structures around encountered stars, and use the energy that is harnessed to accelerate those stars away from the approaching horizon and toward the center of the civilization. We find that such efforts will be most effective for stars with masses in the range of M #8764;(0.2 #8722;1)M #8857;, and could lead to the harvesting of stars within a region extending out to several tens of Mpc in radius, potentially increasing the total amount of energy that is available to a future civilization by a factor of several thousand.

Link: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935118303323 Abstract: Background The health benefits of greenspaces have demanded the attention of policymakers since the 1800s. Although much evidence suggests greenspace exposure is beneficial for health, there exists no systematic review and meta-analysis to synthesise and quantify the impact of greenspace on a wide range of health outcomes. Objective To quantify evidence of the impact of greenspace on a wide range of health outcomes. Methods We searched five online databases and reference lists up to January 2017. Studies satisfying a priori eligibility criteria were evaluated independently by two authors. Results We included 103 observational and 40 interventional studies investigating ~100 health outcomes.

Journal Reference: Prieto Curiel R, Pappalardo L, Gabrielli L, Bishop SR (2018) Gravity and scaling laws of city to city migration. PLoS ONE 13(7): e0199892. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0199892 Link: http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0199892 Abstract Models of human migration provide powerful tools to forecast the flow of migrants, measure the impact of a policy, determine the cost of physical and political frictions and more. Here, we analyse the migration of individuals from and to cities in the US, finding that city to city migration follows scaling laws, so that the city size is a significant factor in determining whether, or not, an individual decides to migrate and the city size of both the origin and destination play key roles in the selection of the destination. We observe that individuals from small cities tend to migrate more frequently, tending to move to similar-sized cities, whereas individuals from large cities do not migrate so often, but when they do, they tend to move to other large cities. Building upon these findings we develop a scaling model which describes internal migration as a two-step decision process, demonstrating that it can partially explain migration fluxes based solely on city size. We then consider the impact of distance and construct a gravity-scaling model by combining the observed scaling patterns with the gravity law of migration. Results show that the scaling laws are a significant feature of human migration and that the inclusion of scaling can overcome the limits of the gravity and the radiation models of human migration.</TEXT>

No licensed prophylactic HIV-1 vaccine exists. A major limitation to date has been the lack of direct comparability between clinical trials and preclinical studies. We aimed to evaluate mosaic adenovirus serotype 26 (Ad26)-based HIV-1 vaccine candidates in parallel studies in humans and rhesus monkeys to define the optimal vaccine regimen to advance into clinical efficacy trials. Methods We conducted a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 1/2a trial (APPROACH). Participants were recruited from 12 clinics in east Africa, South Africa, Thailand, and the USA. We included healthy, HIV-1-uninfected participants (aged 18 #8211;50 years) who were considered at low risk for HIV-1 infection. We randomly assigned participants to one of eight study groups, stratified by region. Participants and investigators were blinded to the treatment allocation throughout the study. We primed participants at weeks 0 and 12 with Ad26.Mos.HIV (5 #8200; #215; #8200;1010 viral particles per 0 #183;5 mL) expressing mosaic HIV-1 envelope (Env)/Gag/Pol antigens and gave boosters at weeks 24 and 48 with Ad26.Mos.HIV or modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA; 108 plaque-forming units per 0 #183;5 mL) vectors with or without high-dose (250  #956;g) or low-dose (50  #956;g) aluminium adjuvanted clade C Env gp140 protein. Those in the control group received 0 #183;9% saline. All study interventions were administered intramuscularly. Primary endpoints were safety and tolerability of the vaccine regimens and Env-specific binding antibody responses at week 28. Safety and immunogenicity were also assessed at week 52. All participants who received at least one vaccine dose or placebo were included in the safety analysis; immunogenicity was analysed using the per-protocol population. We also did a parallel study in rhesus monkeys (NHP 13-19) to assess the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of these vaccine regimens against a series of six repetitive, heterologous, intrarectal challenges with a rhesus peripheral blood mononuclear cell-derived challenge stock of simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV-SF162P3). The APPROACH trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02315703. Findings Between Feb 24, 2015, and Oct 16, 2015, we randomly assigned 393 participants to receive at least one dose of study vaccine or placebo in the APPROACH trial. All vaccine regimens demonstrated favourable safety and tolerability. The most commonly reported solicited local adverse event was mild-to-moderate pain at the injection site (varying from 69% to 88% between the different active groups vs 49% in the placebo group). Five (1%) of 393 participants reported at least one grade 3 adverse event considered related to the vaccines: abdominal pain and diarrhoea (in the same participant), increased aspartate aminotransferase, postural dizziness, back pain, and malaise. The mosaic Ad26/Ad26 plus high-dose gp140 boost vaccine was the most immunogenic in humans; it elicited Env-specific binding antibody responses (100%) and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis responses (80%) at week 52, and T-cell responses at week 50 (83%). We also randomly assigned 72 rhesus monkeys to receive one of five different vaccine regimens or placebo in the NHP 13-19 study. Ad26/Ad26 plus gp140 boost induced similar magnitude, durability, and phenotype of immune responses in rhesus monkeys as compared with humans and afforded 67% protection against acquisition of SHIV-SF162P3 infection (two-sided Fisher's exact test p=0 #183;007).

No licensed prophylactic HIV-1 vaccine exists. A major limitation to date has been the lack of direct comparability between clinical trials and preclinical studies. We aimed to evaluate mosaic adenovirus serotype 26 (Ad26)-based HIV-1 vaccine candidates in parallel studies in humans and rhesus monkeys to define the optimal vaccine regimen to advance into clinical efficacy trials. Methods We conducted a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 1/2a trial (APPROACH). Participants were recruited from 12 clinics in east Africa, South Africa, Thailand, and the USA. We included healthy, HIV-1-uninfected participants (aged 18 #8211;50 years) who were considered at low risk for HIV-1 infection. We randomly assigned participants to one of eight study groups, stratified by region. Participants and investigators were blinded to the treatment allocation throughout the study. We primed participants at weeks 0 and 12 with Ad26.Mos.HIV (5 #8200; #215; #8200;1010 viral particles per 0 #183;5 mL) expressing mosaic HIV-1 envelope (Env)/Gag/Pol antigens and gave boosters at weeks 24 and 48 with Ad26.Mos.HIV or modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA; 108 plaque-forming units per 0 #183;5 mL) vectors with or without high-dose (250  #956;g) or low-dose (50  #956;g) aluminium adjuvanted clade C Env gp140 protein. Those in the control group received 0 #183;9% saline. All study interventions were administered intramuscularly. Primary endpoints were safety and tolerability of the vaccine regimens and Env-specific binding antibody responses at week 28. Safety and immunogenicity were also assessed at week 52. All participants who received at least one vaccine dose or placebo were included in the safety analysis; immunogenicity was analysed using the per-protocol population. We also did a parallel study in rhesus monkeys (NHP 13-19) to assess the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of these vaccine regimens against a series of six repetitive, heterologous, intrarectal challenges with a rhesus peripheral blood mononuclear cell-derived challenge stock of simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV-SF162P3). The APPROACH trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02315703. Findings Between Feb 24, 2015, and Oct 16, 2015, we randomly assigned 393 participants to receive at least one dose of study vaccine or placebo in the APPROACH trial. All vaccine regimens demonstrated favourable safety and tolerability. The most commonly reported solicited local adverse event was mild-to-moderate pain at the injection site (varying from 69% to 88% between the different active groups vs 49% in the placebo group). Five (1%) of 393 participants reported at least one grade 3 adverse event considered related to the vaccines: abdominal pain and diarrhoea (in the same participant), increased aspartate aminotransferase, postural dizziness, back pain, and malaise. The mosaic Ad26/Ad26 plus high-dose gp140 boost vaccine was the most immunogenic in humans; it elicited Env-specific binding antibody responses (100%) and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis responses (80%) at week 52, and T-cell responses at week 50 (83%). We also randomly assigned 72 rhesus monkeys to receive one of five different vaccine regimens or placebo in the NHP 13-19 study. Ad26/Ad26 plus gp140 boost induced similar magnitude, durability, and phenotype of immune responses in rhesus monkeys as compared with humans and afforded 67% protection against acquisition of SHIV-SF162P3 infection (two-sided Fisher's exact test p=0 #183;007). Env-specific ELISA and enzyme-linked immunospot assay responses were the principal immune correlates of protection against SHIV challenge in monkeys. Interpretation The mosaic Ad26/Ad26 plus gp140 HIV-1 vaccine induced comparable and robust immune responses in humans and rhesus monkeys, and it provided significant protection against repetitive heterologous SHIV challenges in rhesus monkeys. This vaccine concept is currently being evaluated in a phase 2b clinical efficacy study in sub-Saharan Africa (NCT03060629).</TEXT>

Findings In a cohort of 292 youths 8 to 18 years of age with normative results of clinical magnetic resonance imaging, delayed age-associated thinning of the cerebral cortex, a pattern suggesting reduced risk for severe mental illness, emerged among individuals who gestated during and after the fortification rollout in the United States (1996-1997). Studies of 2 additional independent US cohorts (N #8201;= #8201;1078) confirmed the reliability and temporal specificity of fortification-associated delays of cortical thinning and demonstrated an associated reduction in psychosis risk. Meaning Beyond its known association with the prevention of neural tube defects, increased gestational exposure to folic acid through food fortification may protect against psychosis through altered postnatal cortical development. Abstract Importance Presently, 81 countries mandate the fortification of grain products with folic acid to lessen the risk of neural tube defects in the developing fetus. Epidemiologic data on severe mental illness suggest potentially broader effects of prenatal folate exposure on postnatal brain development, but this link remains unsubstantiated by biological evidence. Objective To evaluate associations among fetal folic acid exposure, cortical maturation, and psychiatric risk in youths. Design, Setting, and Participants A retrospective, observational clinical cohort study was conducted at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) among 292 youths 8 to 18 years of age born between January 1993 and December 2001 (inclusive of folic acid fortification rollout  #177;3.5 years) with normative results of clinical magnetic resonance imaging, divided into 3 age-matched groups based on birthdate and related level of prenatal folic acid fortification exposure (none, partial, or full). Magnetic resonance imaging was performed between January 2005 and March 2015. Two independent, observational, community-based cohorts (Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort [PNC] and National Institutes of Health Magnetic Resonance Imaging Study of Normal Brain Development [NIH]) comprising 1078 youths 8 to 18 years of age born throughout (PNC, 1992-2003) or before (NIH, 1983-1995) the rollout of folic acid fortification were studied for replication, clinical extension, and specificity. Statistical analysis was conducted from 2015 to 2018. Exposures United States #8211;mandated grain product fortification with folic acid, introduced in late 1996 and fully in effect by mid-1997. Main Outcomes and Measures Differences in cortical thickness among nonexposed, partially exposed, and fully exposed youths (MGH) and underlying associations between age and cortical thickness (all cohorts). Analysis of the PNC cohort also examined the association of age #8211;cortical thickness slopes with the odds of psychotic symptoms. Results The MGH cohort (139 girls and 153 boys; mean [SD] age, 13.3 [2.3] years) demonstrated exposure-associated cortical thickness increases in bilateral frontal and temporal regions (9.9% to 11.6%; corrected P #8201; lt; #8201;.001 to P #8201;= #8201;.03) and emergence of quadratic (delayed) age-associated thinning in temporal and parietal regions ( #946; #8201;= #8201; #8211;11.1 to  #8211;13.9; corrected P #8201;= #8201;.002). The contemporaneous PNC cohort (417 girls and 444 boys; mean [SD] age, 13.5 [2.7] years) also exhibited exposure-associated delays of cortical thinning ( #946; #8201;= #8201; #8211;1.59 to  #8211;1.73; corrected P #8201; lt; #8201;.001 to P #8201;= #8201;.02), located in similar regions and with similar durations of delay as in the MGH cohort. Flatter thinning profiles in frontal, temporal, and parietal regions were associated with lower odds of psychosis spectrum symptoms in the PNC cohort (odds ratio, 0.37-0.59; corrected P #8201; lt; #8201;.05). All identified regions displayed earlier thinning in the nonexposed NIH cohort (118 girls and 99 boys; mean [SD] age, 13.3 [2.6] years). Conclusions and Relevance The results of this study suggest an association between gestational exposure to fortification of grain products with folic acid and altered cortical development and, in turn, with reduction in the risk of psychosis in youths.</TEXT>

Drug combinations can help to fight multi-drug-resistant bacterial infections, yet they are largely unexplored and rarely used in clinics. Here we profile almost 3,000 dose-resolved combinations of antibiotics, human-targeted drugs and food additives in six strains from three Gram-negative pathogens #8212;Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and Pseudomonas aeruginosa #8212;to identify general principles for antibacterial drug combinations and understand their potential. Despite the phylogenetic relatedness of the three species, more than 70% of the drug #8211;drug interactions that we detected are species-specific and 20% display strain specificity, revealing a large potential for narrow-spectrum therapies. Overall, antagonisms are more common than synergies and occur almost exclusively between drugs that target different cellular processes, whereas synergies are more conserved and are enriched in drugs that target the same process. We provide mechanistic insights into this dichotomy and further dissect the interactions of the food additive vanillin. Finally, we demonstrate that several synergies are effective against multi-drug-resistant clinical isolates in vitro and during infections of the larvae of the greater wax moth Galleria mellonella, with one reverting resistance to the last-resort antibiotic colistin.</TEXT>

Nevertheless, little attention has been given to how attachment dynamics influence relationships at work or the extent to which adult attachment patterns are mirrored in leaders' perceptions and behaviors toward their direct reports. Moreover, attachment measures that use romantic relationships as their referent might not be appropriate for use in organizational settings with executive clients. Thus, a measure that directly references direct reports and that could be put to use in organizational contexts is needed. The two studies reported here supported the two-factor orthogonal structure of such a measure and results from a sample of Fortune 500 executives reveal that leader attachment relates in theoretically consistent ways with general adult attachment, the Big Five, emotional intelligence, and critical thinking. Results are discussed in terms of integrating attachment measures into organizational personality assessment to inform work with organizational clients.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Journal reference: A Combination of Nootropic Ingredients (CAF+) Is Not Better than Caffeine in Improving Cognitive Functions Caldenhove, S., Sambeth, A., Sharma, S. et al. J Cogn Enhanc (2018) 2: 106. DOI: https://doi.org/10.1007/s41465-017-0061-0 Link: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41465-017-0061-0 Abstract Many nootropic compounds claim to have positive effects on cognitive performance. In this study, we tested the effects of the nootropic compound CAF+ on cognitive functioning. CAF+ contains a combination of ingredients that has separately shown to boost cognitive performance, including caffeine, l-theanine, vinpocetine, l-tyrosine, and vitamin B6/B12. We examined whether CAF+ would improve cognitive functions in healthy young participants, and whether it would be more effective than caffeine. We used a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled three-way cross-over design to examine the performance of 21 healthy young participants on a test battery aimed to measure memory performance, attention, and sensorimotor speed. Our main outcome measure was participant #8217;s performance on the Verbal Learning Test (VLT). Subjective alertness, heart rate, and blood pressure were also monitored. Participants were tested at 30 and 90 min after treatment. We found that after 90 min, the delayed recall performance on the VLT after caffeine was better than after CAF+ treatment. Further, caffeine, but not CAF+, improved the performance in a working memory task. In a complex choice reaction task caffeine improved the speed of responding. Subjective alertness was increased as a result of CAF+ at 30 min after administration. Only caffeine increased diastolic blood pressure. We conclude that in healthy young students, caffeine improves memory performance and sensorimotor speed, whereas CAF+ does not affect the cognitive performance at the dose tested.</TEXT>

We propose that level of education, openness to experience, and a favourable labour market relate positively to employees crossing organizational, industrial, and occupational boundaries. Management programme alumni (N = 503) provided information through an online survey about their career histories, their level of education, and their openness to experience. Additionally, we used the unemployment rate as an indicator for yearly changes in the labour market. The results of our cross-classified multilevel analysis indicate that both individual characteristics and the labour market are determinants of career mobility. Level of education had a positive effect on organizational and industrial boundary crossing, and changes in the labour market related to organizational boundary crossing. Against our assumptions, openness to experience had no effect on career mobility, and none of the predictors were related to occupational boundary crossing. Our results demonstrate the importance of investigating career mobility from a boundary perspective combined with a focus on both individual and contextual characteristics. The dominance of education compared to personality and the difficulty of explaining occupational mobility open new research avenues and yield practical implications for employees, career counsellors, and organizations.</TEXT>

To date, the evidence is limited to a narrow set of well-being measures that ask participants for a single assessment of their life in general. We address this shortcoming by examining the relationship between political orientation and well-being using measures of life satisfaction, affect, and meaning and purpose in life. Participants completed well-being measures after reflecting on their whole life (Studies 1a, 1b, and 2), at the end of their day (Study 3), and in the present moment (Study 4). Across five studies, conservatives reported greater meaning and purpose in life than liberals at each reporting period. This finding remained significant after adjusting for religiosity and was usually stronger than the relationships involving other well-being measures. Finally, meaning in life was more closely related to social conservatism than economic conservatism.</TEXT>

Journal Reference: Human Listeners Can Accurately Judge Strength and Height Relative to Self from Aggressive Roars and Speech iScience, Volume 4, 29 June 2018, Pages 273-280 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isci.2018.05.002 Link: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589004218300579 Highlights  #8226; We measured the strength and height of men and women (speakers and listeners)  #8226; Listeners rated the strength/height of speakers relative to their own, from roars and speech  #8226; Despite sex biases, listeners accurately judged relative strength/height from voice  #8226; In males only, roars maximized the expression of threat compared to aggressive speech Summary Although animal vocalizations and human speech are known to communicate physical formidability, no previous study has examined whether human listeners can assess the strength or body size of vocalizers relative to their own, either from speech or from nonverbal vocalizations. Here, although men tended to underestimate women's formidability, and women to overestimate men's, listeners judged relative strength and height from aggressive roars and aggressive speech accurately. For example, when judging roars, male listeners accurately identified vocalizers who were substantially stronger than themselves in 88% of trials, and never as weaker. For male vocalizers only, roars functioned to exaggerate the expression of threat compared to aggressive speech, as men were rated as relatively stronger when producing roars. These results indicate that, like other mammals, the acoustic structure of human aggressive vocal signals (and in particular roars) may have been selected to communicate functional information relevant to listeners' survival.</TEXT>

Journal Reference: Parents #8217; Adverse Childhood Experiences and Their Children #8217;s Behavioral Health Problems Adam Schickedanz, Neal Halfon, Narayan Sastry, Paul J.

Whether parents #8217; ACE counts (an index of standard ACEs) confer intergenerational risk to their children #8217;s behavioral health is unknown. In this study, we estimate the risk of child behavioral problems as a function of parent ACE counts. METHODS: We obtained retrospective information on 9 ACEs self-reported by parents and parent reports of their children #8217;s (1) behavioral problems (using the Behavior Problems Index [BPI]), (2) attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder diagnosis, and (3) emotional disturbance diagnosis from the 2013 Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) core interview and the linked PSID Childhood Retrospective Circumstances Study and 2014 PSID Child Development Supplement. Multivariate linear and logistic regression models were used to estimate child behavioral health outcomes by parent retrospective ACE count. RESULTS: Children of parents with a history of 4 or more ACEs had on average a 2.3-point (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.3 #8211;3.2) higher score on the BPI, 2.1 times (95% CI: 1.1 #8211;3.8) higher odds of hyperactivity, and 4.2 times (95% CI: 1.7 #8211;10.8) higher odds of an emotional disturbance diagnosis than children of parents with no ACEs. Maternal ACEs revealed a stronger association with child behavior problems than paternal ACEs. Relationships between parents #8217; 9 component ACEs individually and children #8217;s BPI scores revealed consistently positive associations. Mediation by parent emotional distress and aggravation were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Parents with greater exposure to ACEs are more likely to have children with behavioral health problems.</TEXT>

Using behavioral readouts of pain hypersensitivity induced by Angiotensin II (Ang II) injection into mouse hindpaws, our study shows that activation of the type 2 Ang II receptor (AT2R) and the cell damage-sensing ion channel TRPA1 are required for peripheral mechanical pain sensitization induced by Ang II in male and female mice. However, we show that AT2R is not expressed in mouse and human dorsal root ganglia (DRG) sensory neurons. Instead, expression/activation of AT2R on peripheral/skin macrophages (M #934;s) constitutes a critical trigger of mouse and human DRG sensory neuron excitation. Ang II-induced peripheral mechanical pain hypersensitivity can be attenuated by chemogenetic depletion of peripheral M #934;s. Furthermore, AT2R activation in M #934;s triggers production of reactive oxygen/nitrogen species, which trans-activate TRPA1 on mouse and human DRG sensory neurons, via cysteine-modification of the channel. Our study thus identifies a translatable immune cell-to-sensory neuron signaling crosstalk underlying peripheral nociceptor sensitization. This form of cell-to-cell signaling represents a critical peripheral mechanism for chronic pain, and thus identifies multiple druggable analgesic targets. Significance Statement: Pain is a widespread problem that is under-managed by currently available analgesics. Findings from a recent clinical trial on a type-II angiotensin II receptor (AT2R) antagonist showed effective analgesia for neuropathic pain. AT2R antagonists have been shown to reduce neuropathy-, inflammation- and bone cancer-associated pain in rodents. We report that activation of AT2R in macrophages that infiltrate the site of injury, but not in sensory neurons, triggers an intercellular redox communication with sensory neurons via activation of the cell damage/pain-sensing ion channel TRPA1. This macrophage-to-sensory neuron crosstalk results in peripheral pain sensitization. Our findings provide an evidence-based mechanism underlying the analgesic action of AT2R antagonists, which could accelerate the development of efficacious non-opioid analgesic drugs for multiple pain conditions.</TEXT>

Results Thematic analysis revealed 6 major themes: responsibility for the decision to operate, perceived futility, surgeon judgment, surgeon introspection, pressure to operate, and costs of the operation. Perceived futility was universally considered a contraindication to surgical intervention. However, the challenge of defining futility led participants to emphasize the importance of patients' self-determined risk-to-benefit analysis when considering surgical intervention. More experienced surgeons reported greater comfort with communicating to patients that a condition was not amenable to an operation and reserved the right to refuse to operate.

Early intervention through intrauterine gene editing, however, could correct the genetic defect, potentially allowing for normal organ development, functional disease improvement, or cure. Here we demonstrate safe intravenous and intra-amniotic administration of polymeric nanoparticles to fetal mouse tissues at selected gestational ages with no effect on survival or postnatal growth. In utero introduction of nanoparticles containing peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) and donor DNAs corrects a disease-causing mutation in the  #946;-globin gene in a mouse model of human  #946;-thalassemia, yielding sustained postnatal elevation of blood hemoglobin levels into the normal range, reduced reticulocyte counts, reversal of splenomegaly, and improved survival, with no detected off-target mutations in partially homologous loci. This work may provide the basis for a safe and versatile method of fetal gene editing for human monogenic disorders.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Journal reference: Shikha Prashad, Elizabeth S. Dedrick, Francesca M. Filbey, Cannabis users exhibit increased cortical activation during resting state compared to non-users, NeuroImage, Volume 179, 2018, Pages 176-186, ISSN 1053-8119, DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2018.06.031. Link: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S105381191830538X Highlights  #8226; Global resting state cortical activity in cannabis users was measured using EEG.  #8226; Users exhibited increased cortical activity and connectivity compared to controls.  #8226; Increased activity reflects a noisy brain with loss of neural refinement and efficiency.  #8226; This increase may underlie putative cognitive impairments in cannabis users.  #8226; EEG signals may be useful neural correlates for tracking progress and efficacy of interventions. Abstract: Studies have shown altered task-based brain functioning as a result of cannabis use. To date, however, whether similar alterations in baseline resting state and functional organization of neural activity are observable in cannabis users remains unknown. We characterized global resting state cortical activations and functional connectivity via electroencephalography (EEG) in cannabis users and related these activations to measures of cannabis use. Resting state EEG in the eyes closed condition was collected from age- and sex-matched cannabis users (N #8239;= #8239;17; 6 females; mean age #8239;= #8239;30.9 #8239; #177; #8239;7.4 years) and non-using controls (N #8239;= #8239;21; 9 females; mean age #8239;= #8239;33.1 #8239; #177; #8239;11.6 years). Power spectral density and spectral coherence were computed to determine differences in cortical activations and connectivity between the two groups in the delta (1 #8211;4Hz), theta (4 #8211;7 #8239;Hz), alpha (8 #8211;12 #8239;Hz), beta (13 #8211;30 #8239;Hz), and gamma (31 #8211;50 #8239;Hz) frequency bands. Cannabis users exhibited decreased delta and increased theta, beta, and gamma power compared to controls, suggesting increased cortical activation in resting state and a disinhibition of inhibitory functions that may interrupt cognitive processes. Cannabis users also exhibited increased interhemispheric and intrahemispheric coherence relative to controls, reduced mean network degree, and increased clustering coefficient in specific regions and frequencies. This increased cortical activity may indicate a loss of neural refinement and efficiency that may indicate a  #8220;noisy #8221; brain. Lastly, measures related to cannabis use were correlated with spectral power and functional connectivity measures, indicating that specific electrophysiological signals are associated with cannabis use. These results suggest that there are differences in cortical activity and connectivity between cannabis users and non-using controls in the resting state that may be related to putative cognitive impairments and can inform effectiveness of intervention programs.</TEXT>

Five studies showed that women prefer men with BS attitudes (Studies 1a, 1b, and 3) and behaviors (Studies 2a and 2b), especially in mating contexts, because BS mates are perceived as willing to invest (protect, provide, and commit).

The author points out that the otherwise valuable phenomenon of cognitive shift, which occurred in social psychology precisely in the 1970s, naturally boosted the interest of psychologists in such phenomena like stereotypes, attitudes, and values; at the same time, it unfortunately decreased interest in others, like aggression, altruism, and social influence. In recent decades, we have also witnessed a growing conviction among psychologists that explaining why people display certain reactions holds greater importance than demonstrating the conditions under which people display these reactions. This assumption has been accompanied by the spread of statistical analysis applied to empirical data, which has led to researchers today generally preferring to employ survey studies (even if they are a component of experiments being conducted) to the analysis of behavioural variables. The author analyses the contents of the most recent volume of  #8220;Journal of Personality and Social Psychology #8221;, and argues that it is essentially devoid of presentations of empirical studies in which human behaviours are examined. This gives rise to the question of whether social psychology remains a science of behaviour, and whether such a condition of the discipline is desirable.</TEXT>

Tokamaks are rotationally symmetric and use a large plasma current to achieve confinement, whereas stellarators are non-axisymmetric and employ three-dimensionally shaped magnetic field coils to twist the field and confine the plasma. As a result, the magnetic field of a stellarator needs to be carefully designed to minimize the collisional transport arising from poorly confined particle orbits, which would otherwise cause excessive power losses at high plasma temperatures. In addition, this type of transport leads to the appearance of a net toroidal plasma current, the so-called bootstrap current. Here, we analyse results from the first experimental campaign of the Wendelstein 7-X stellarator, showing that its magnetic-field design allows good control of bootstrap currents and collisional transport. The energy confinement time is among the best ever achieved in stellarators, both in absolute figures ( #964;E #8201; gt; #8201;100 #8201;ms) and relative to the stellarator confinement scaling. The bootstrap current responds as predicted to changes in the magnetic mirror ratio. These initial experiments confirm several theoretically predicted properties of Wendelstein 7-X plasmas, and already indicate consistency with optimization measures.</TEXT>

Journal Reference: Association of Multivitamin and Mineral Supplementation and Risk of Cardiovascular Disease A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Joonseok Kim, Jaehyoung Choi, Soo Young Kwon, John W. McEvoy, Michael J. Blaha, Roger S. Blumenthal, Eliseo Guallar, Di Zhao, Erin D. Michos DOI: https://doi.org/10.1161/CIRCOUTCOMES.117.004224 Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes. 2018;11:e004224 Originally published July 10, 2018 Link: http://circoutcomes.ahajournals.org/content/11/7/e004224 Abstract Background: Multiple studies have attempted to identify the association between multivitamin/mineral (MVM) supplementation and cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes, but the benefits remain controversial. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the associations between MVM supplementation and various CVD outcomes, including coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke. Methods and Results: We conducted a comprehensive search of Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Library for studies published between January 1970 and August 2016. We included clinical trials and prospective cohort studies in the general population evaluating associations between MVM supplementation and CVD outcomes. Data extraction and quality assessment were independently conducted by 2 authors, and a third author resolved discrepancies. Eighteen studies with 2 019 862 participants and 18 363 326 person-years of follow-up were included in the analysis. Five studies specified the dose/type of MVM supplement and the rest did not. Overall, there was no association between MVM supplementation and CVD mortality (relative risk [RR], 1.00; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.97 #8211;1.04), CHD mortality (RR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.92 #8211;1.13), stroke mortality (RR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.82 #8211;1.09), or stroke incidence (RR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.91 #8211;1.05). There was no association between MVM supplements and CVD or CHD mortality in prespecified subgroups categorized by mean follow-up period, mean age, period of MVM use, sex, type of population, exclusion of patients with history of CHD, and adjustment for diet, adjustment for smoking, adjustment for physical activity, and study site. In contrast, MVM use did seem to be associated with a lower risk of CHD incidence (RR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.79 #8211;0.97). However, this association did not remain significant in the pooled subgroup analysis of randomized controlled trials (RR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.80 #8211;1.19). Conclusions: Our meta-analysis of clinical trials and prospective cohort studies demonstrates that MVM supplementation does not improve cardiovascular outcomes in the general population.</TEXT>

The objectives of this study were to examine the variability in measures of driving risk among adolescents during the learner and early independent driving periods and evaluate how risk varies by driving experience, gender, time of day, and road surface conditions. Methods Objective driving data were collected in a naturalistic cohort study of 90 adolescent drivers with learner driving permit and 131 experienced adult drivers. Participants #8217; private vehicles were equipped with data acquisition system documenting driving kinematics, miles driven, and video recordings of the driver and the driving environment. Crash/near-crash (CNC) and kinematic risky driving (KRD) rates were calculated during the learner and early independent driving periods by gender (female/male), time of day (day/night), and road surface conditions (wet/dry) for adolescents and adults. Results CNC and KRD rates of adolescents were similar to adult drivers during the learner period (CNC: incident rate ratio [IRR] = 1.67, confidence interval [CI] #8239;= #8239;.98 #8211;2.82 and KRD: IRR #8239;= #8239;1.04, CI #8239;= #8239;.78 #8211;1.40, respectively), but dramatically higher in the first year of independent driving (CNC: IRR #8239;= #8239;6.51, CI #8239;= #8239;4.03 #8211;10.51 and KRD: IRR #8239;= #8239;3.95, CI #8239;= #8239;2.96 #8211;5.26, respectively), and particularly elevated the first 3months of licensure. Adolescent KRD rates were higher for males than females and invariably higher than adult rates during day and night, wet and dry conditions. Conclusions While the learner driving period was relatively safe for adolescents, the transition to independent driving was typified by a dramatic increase in risk among adolescents that was higher than adult rates overall and under varying driving conditions.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Journal reference: Efficient solar hydrogen generation in microgravity environment Katharina Brinkert, Matthias H. Richter, [ #8230;]Hans-Joachim Lewerenz Nature Communications, volume 9, Article number: 2527 (2018) DOI: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-018-04844-y Link: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04844-y Abstract Long-term space missions require extra-terrestrial production of storable, renewable energy. Hydrogen is ascribed a crucial role for transportation, electrical power and oxygen generation. We demonstrate in a series of drop tower experiments that efficient direct hydrogen production can be realized photoelectrochemically in microgravity environment, providing an alternative route to existing life support technologies for space travel. The photoelectrochemical cell consists of an integrated catalyst-functionalized semiconductor system that generates hydrogen with current densities  gt;15 #8201;mA/cm2 in the absence of buoyancy. Conditions are described adverting the resulting formation of ion transport blocking froth layers on the photoelectrodes. The current limiting factors were overcome by controlling the micro- and nanotopography of the Rh electrocatalyst using shadow nanosphere lithography. The behaviour of the applied system in terrestrial and microgravity environment is simulated using a kinetic transport model. Differences observed for varied catalyst topography are elucidated, enabling future photoelectrode designs for use in reduced gravity environments.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Journal reference: Citation Tian, A. D., Schroeder, J., H #228;ubl, G., Risen, J. L., Norton, M. I.,  amp; Gino, F. (2018). Enacting rituals to improve self-control. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 114(6), 851-876. DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/pspa0000113 Link: http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2018-22169-001 Abstract Rituals are predefined sequences of actions characterized by rigidity and repetition. We propose that enacting ritualized actions can enhance subjective feelings of self-discipline, such that rituals can be harnessed to improve behavioral self-control. We test this hypothesis in 6 experiments. A field experiment showed that engaging in a pre-eating ritual over a 5-day period helped participants reduce calorie intake (Experiment 1). Pairing a ritual with healthy eating behavior increased the likelihood of choosing healthy food in a subsequent decision (Experiment 2), and enacting a ritual before a food choice (i.e., without being integrated into the consumption process) promoted the choice of healthy food over unhealthy food (Experiments 3a and 3b). The positive effect of rituals on self-control held even when a set of ritualized gestures were not explicitly labeled as a ritual, and in other domains of behavioral self-control (i.e., prosocial decision-making; Experiments 4 and 5). Furthermore, Experiments 3a, 3b, 4, and 5 provided evidence for the psychological process underlying the effectiveness of rituals: heightened feelings of self-discipline. Finally, Experiment 5 showed that the absence of a self-control conflict eliminated the effect of rituals on behavior, demonstrating that rituals affect behavioral self-control specifically because they alter responses to self-control conflicts. We conclude by briefly describing the results of a number of additional experiments examining rituals in other self-control domains. Our body of evidence suggests that rituals can have beneficial consequences for self-control. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Journal Reference: Sathya Narayan Kanakaraj, Noe T Alvarez, Seyram Gbordzoe, Matthew Steven Lucas, Benji Maruyama, Ryan Noga, Yu-Yun Hsieh, Vesselin Shanov. Improved dry spinning process at elevated temperatures for making uniform and high strength CNT fibers. Materials Research Express, 2018; 5 (6): 065036 DOI: 10.1088/2053-1591/aac757 Link: http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2053-1591/aac757/meta Abstract Issues associated with the dry spinning process were explored and addressed in this paper. Post-treatment of dry-spun Carbon Nanotube (CNT) fibers frequently includes solvent densification. This procedure was modified in our work to enhance mechanical strength of the fiber. The effect of n #8211;Methyl-2-Pyrrolidone (NMP) as a densifying solvent was studied at different temperatures within the range of 23  #176;C #8211;153  #176;C. High temperature densified fibers revealed better load bearing (40% increase) and higher density compared to room temperature values, which translated to higher tensile strengths (1.2 #8211;1.3 GPa). A maximum tensile strength of 1.5 GPa was achieved with resistance assisted heating combined with NMP heating. However, all these properties, including the fiber diameter, varied depending on the position within the array from where the fibers were drawn. This was attributed to a gradation in the length of the CNT's along the location of the drawing area within the array. Improved fiber uniformity was achieved by drawing from opposite ends of CNT arrays simultaneously. This study enabled to improve the densification process and addressed a major fiber uniformity problem accompanying the dry spinning method.</TEXT>

The derived results were obtained via spectral synthesis (1D LTE) adopting both MARCS and PHOENIX model atmospheres; stellar parameters and chemical abundances derived from the different adopted models do not show significant offsets. Mass #8211;radius modeling of Ross 128b indicates that it lies below the pure-rock composition curve, suggesting that it contains a mixture of rock and iron, with the relative amounts of each set by the ratio of Fe/Mg. If Ross 128b formed with a subsolar Si abundance, and assuming the planet's composition matches that of the host star, it likely has a larger core size relative to the Earth despite this producing a planet with a Si/Mg abundance ratio ~34% greater than the Sun.

    <TITLE>The exoplanet called Ross 128 b is just 11 light years away from Earth. New research strengthens the argument that it #8217;s a temperate planet in the inner edge of the habitable  #8220;Goldilocks #8221; zone that could potentially have liquid water on its surface.</TITLE>

We determined precise atmospheric parameters T eff = 3231  #177; 100 K, log g = 4.96  #177; 0.11 dex and chemical abundances of eight elements (C, O, Mg, Al, K, Ca, Ti, and Fe), finding Ross 128 to have near solar metallicity ([Fe/H] = +0.03  #177; 0.09 dex). The derived results were obtained via spectral synthesis (1D LTE) adopting both MARCS and PHOENIX model atmospheres; stellar parameters and chemical abundances derived from the different adopted models do not show significant offsets. Mass #8211;radius modeling of Ross 128b indicates that it lies below the pure-rock composition curve, suggesting that it contains a mixture of rock and iron, with the relative amounts of each set by the ratio of Fe/Mg. If Ross 128b formed with a subsolar Si abundance, and assuming the planet's composition matches that of the host star, it likely has a larger core size relative to the Earth despite this producing a planet with a Si/Mg abundance ratio ~34% greater than the Sun. The derived planetary parameters #8212;insolation flux (S Earth = 1.79  #177; 0.26) and equilibrium temperature (T eq = 294  #177; 10 K) #8212;support previous findings that Ross 128b is a temperate exoplanet in the inner edge of the habitable zone.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Journal reference: Performance Comparison of the Digital Neuromorphic Hardware SpiNNaker and the Neural Network Simulation Software NEST for a Full-Scale Cortical Microcircuit Model Sacha J. van Albada1*, Andrew G. Rowley2, Johanna Senk1, Michael Hopkins2, Maximilian Schmidt1,3, Alan B. Stokes2, David R. Lester2, Markus Diesmann1,4,5 and Steve B. Furber2 Front. Neurosci., 23 May 2018 DOI: https://doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2018.00291 Link: https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2018.00291/full Abstract The digital neuromorphic hardware SpiNNaker has been developed with the aim of enabling large-scale neural network simulations in real time and with low power consumption. Real-time performance is achieved with 1 ms integration time steps, and thus applies to neural networks for which faster time scales of the dynamics can be neglected. By slowing down the simulation, shorter integration time steps and hence faster time scales, which are often biologically relevant, can be incorporated. We here describe the first full-scale simulations of a cortical microcircuit with biological time scales on SpiNNaker. Since about half the synapses onto the neurons arise within the microcircuit, larger cortical circuits have only moderately more synapses per neuron. Therefore, the full-scale microcircuit paves the way for simulating cortical circuits of arbitrary size. With approximately 80, 000 neurons and 0.3 billion synapses, this model is the largest simulated on SpiNNaker to date. The scale-up is enabled by recent developments in the SpiNNaker software stack that allow simulations to be spread across multiple boards. Comparison with simulations using the NEST software on a high-performance cluster shows that both simulators can reach a similar accuracy, despite the fixed-point arithmetic of SpiNNaker, demonstrating the usability of SpiNNaker for computational neuroscience applications with biological time scales and large network size. The runtime and power consumption are also assessed for both simulators on the example of the cortical microcircuit model. To obtain an accuracy similar to that of NEST with 0.1 ms time steps, SpiNNaker requires a slowdown factor of around 20 compared to real time. The runtime for NEST saturates around 3 times real time using hybrid parallelization with MPI and multi-threading. However, achieving this runtime comes at the cost of increased power and energy consumption. The lowest total energy consumption for NEST is reached at around 144 parallel threads and 4.6 times slowdown. At this setting, NEST and SpiNNaker have a comparable energy consumption per synaptic event. Our results widen the application domain of SpiNNaker and help guide its development, showing that further optimizations such as synapse-centric network representation are necessary to enable real-time simulation of large biological neural networks.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The title of the post is a copy and paste from the title and first paragraph of the linked academic press release here :  gt; Living in areas with less sun may increase your risk of obsessive compulsive disorder  gt; Living at higher latitudes, where there is also less sunlight, could result in a higher prevalence rate of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), according to new research from Binghamton University, State University of New York. Journal Reference: Meredith E. Coles, Carle Jordan Wirshba, Jacob Nota, Jessica Schubert, Breanna A. Grunthal, Obsessive compulsive disorder prevalence increases with latitude, Journal of Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders, Volume 18, 2018, Pages 25-30, ISSN 2211-3649, DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jocrd.2018.04.001. Link: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211364917300635 Abstract: Many individuals with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) report difficulty falling asleep until later than desired. This may reflect a misalignment between the sleep-wake cycle and the natural light dark cycle. Delayed bedtimes are related to disruptions in cognitive processes, increases in repetitive negative thinking, and OCD symptoms. Misalignment is more common in higher latitudes. AIMS: We hypothesized that the prevalence of OCD would be positively correlated with latitude. A systematic review of the literature identified peer-reviewed publications with estimates of OCD prevalence in the general population. Twenty-four estimates of the lifetime prevalence of OCD were identified and showed that the prevalence of OCD was significantly positively correlated with latitude. Other potential alternative individual, community and study specific factors were not significantly correlated with OCD prevalence. Finally, parallel analyses of a  #8220;psychiatric control #8221; (panic disorder) failed to find a significant relationship between panic disorder and latitude. Findings from this study support a relation between latitude and OCD and suggest potential specificity of the relation to OCD vs factors related to mental health concerns broadly. These findings are consistent with recent results suggesting that the timing of sleep may be important in OCD. Future work in this area is warranted.</TEXT>

In fact, certain types of dairy fat may help guard against having a severe stroke, the researchers reported. Journal Reference: Marcia C de Oliveira Otto Rozenn N Lemaitre Xiaoling Song Irena B King David S Siscovick Dariush Mozaffarian. Serial measures of circulating biomarkers of dairy fat and total and cause-specific mortality in older adults: the Cardiovascular Health Study. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, 2018 DOI: 10.1093/ajcn/nqy117 Link: https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/ajcn/nqy117/5052139?redirectedFrom=fulltext ABSTRACT Background Controversy has emerged about the benefits compared with harms of dairy fat, including concerns over long-term effects. Previous observational studies have assessed self-reported estimates of consumption or a single biomarker measure at baseline, which may lead to suboptimal estimation of true risk. Objective The aim of this study was to investigate prospective associations of serial measures of plasma phospholipid fatty acids pentadecanoic (15:0), heptadecanoic (17:0), and trans-palmitoleic (trans-16:1n #8211;7) acids with total mortality, cause-specific mortality, and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk among older adults. Design Among 2907 US adults aged  #8805;65 y and free of CVD at baseline, circulating fatty acid concentrations were measured serially at baseline, 6 y, and 13 y. Deaths and CVD events were assessed and adjudicated centrally. Prospective associations were assessed by multivariate-adjusted Cox models incorporating time-dependent exposures and covariates. Results During 22 y of follow-up, 2428 deaths occurred, including 833 from CVD, 1595 from non-CVD causes, and 1301 incident CVD events. In multivariable models, circulating pentadecanoic, heptadecanoic, and trans-palmitoleic acids were not significantly associated with total mortality, with extreme-quintile HRs of 1.05 for pentadecanoic (95% CI: 0.91, 1.22), 1.07 for heptadecanoic (95% CI: 0.93, 1.23), and 1.05 for trans-palmitoleic (95% CI: 0.91, 1.20) acids. Circulating heptadecanoic acid was associated with lower CVD mortality (extreme-quintile HR: 0.77; 95% CI: 0.61, 0.98), especially stroke mortality, with a 42% lower risk when comparing extreme quintiles of heptadecanoic acid concentrations (HR: 0.58; 95% CI: 0.35, 0.97). In contrast, heptadecanoic acid was associated with a higher risk of non-CVD mortality (HR: 1.27; 95% CI: 1.07, 1.52), which was not clearly related to any single subtype of non-CVD death. No significant associations of pentadecanoic, heptadecanoic, or trans-palmitoleic acids were seen for total incident CVD, coronary heart disease, or stroke. Conclusions Long-term exposure to circulating phospholipid pentadecanoic, heptadecanoic, or trans-palmitoleic acids was not significantly associated with total mortality or incident CVD among older adults. High circulating heptadecanoic acid was inversely associated with CVD and stroke mortality and potentially associated with higher risk of non-CVD death.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The title of the post is a copy and paste from the title and first paragraph of the linked academic press release here :  gt; About half of parents use cell phones while driving with young children in the car  gt; A new study from a team of researchers at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) and the University of Pennsylvania School of Nursing (Penn Nursing) found that in the previous three months, about half of parents talked on a cell phone while driving when their children between the ages of 4 and 10 were in the car, while one in three read text messages and one in seven used social media. Journal Reference: Factors Associated with Cell Phone Use While Driving: A Survey of Parents and Caregivers of Children Ages 4-10 Years Catherine C. McDonald, PhD, RN, Journal of Pediatrics 2018 Published Online: July 12, 2018 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpeds.2018.06.003 Link: https://www.jpeds.com/inpress#/article/S0022-3476(18)30772-8/fulltext Abstract Objectives To examine characteristics associated with cell phone use while driving by parents and caregivers of children ages 4-10 years. Study design National cross-sectional online survey with a convenience sample (March 2017-April 2017). Inclusion criteria: Parent/caregiver of a child age 4-10 years in their home, age  #8805;18 years, read and spoke English, and drove child  #8805;6 times in previous 3 months. Adjusted logistic regression analyses were modeled for outcome measures of previous 3-month self-report cell phone use while driving with the child. Results The analytic sample was n #8201;= #8201;760. In the previous 3 months, 47% of parent/caregivers talked on a hand-held phone, 52.2% talked on a hands-free phone, 33.7% read texts, 26.7% sent texts, and 13.7% used social media while driving with their child in the vehicle. Compared with those who always used their typical child restraint system, participants who did not always use were more likely to talk on a hands-free phone (aOR 1.97, 95% CI 1.26-3.09), read a text (aOR 1.74, 95% CI 1.11-2.73), send a text (aOR 1.65, 95% CI 1.04-2.62), and use social media (aOR 2.92, 95% CI 1.73-4.94) while driving. Higher income, not wearing a seat belt (driver) on every trip, and driving under influence of alcohol also were associated with various types of cell phone use while driving. Conclusions Inconsistent child restraint system use, lack of seat belt use, and driving under the influence of alcohol are associated with parent/caregiver cell phone use while driving. Screening and education related to parental driving behaviors should include addressing multiple risk behaviors.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Journal Reference: J. L. Kuk, M. Rotondi, X. Sui, S. N. Blair, C. I. Ardern. Individuals with obesity but no other metabolic risk factors are not at significantly elevated all-cause mortality risk in men and women. Clinical Obesity, 2018; DOI: 10.1111/cob.12263 Link: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/cob.12263 Summary Studies have examined mortality risk for metabolically healthy obesity, defined as zero or one metabolic risk factors but not as zero risk factors. Thus, we sought to determine the independent mortality risk associated with obesity or elevated glucose, blood pressure or lipids in isolation or clustered together. The sample included 54 #8201;089 men and women from five cohort studies (follow #8208;up #8201;= #8201;12.8 #8201; #177; #8201;7.2 years and 4864 [9.0%] deaths). Individuals were categorized as having obesity or elevated glucose, blood pressure or lipids alone or clustered with obesity or another metabolic factor. In our study sample, 6% of individuals presented with obesity but no other metabolic abnormalities. General obesity (hazard ratios [HR], 95% CI #8201;= #8201;1.10, 0.8 #8211;1.6) and abdominal obesity (HR #8201;= #8201;1.24, 0.9 #8211;1.7) in the absence of metabolic risk factors were not associated with mortality risk compared to lean individuals. Conversely, diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidaemia in isolation were significantly associated with mortality risk (HR range #8201;= #8201;1.17 #8211;1.94, P #8201; lt; #8201;0.05). However, when using traditional approaches, obesity (HR #8201;= #8201;1.12, 1.02 #8211;1.23) is independently associated with mortality risk after statistical adjustment for the other metabolic risk factors. Similarly, metabolically healthy obesity, when defined as zero or one risk factor, is also associated with increased mortality risk (HR #8201;= #8201;1.15, 1.01 #8211;1.32) as compared to lean healthy individuals. Obesity in the absence of metabolic abnormalities may not be associated with higher risk for all #8208;cause mortality compared to lean healthy individuals. Conversely, elevation of even a single metabolic risk factor is associated with increased mortality risk.</TEXT>

A natural follow-up question is how this difference in attitudes relates to actual behavior. But self-reports of sexual behavior may be compromised by a social desirability bias that is influenced by the very sexual attitudes at issue. We employed a non-self-reported measure of sexual behavior: usage of the adultery-focused dating website Ashley Madison. Linking an August 2015 leak of user data from Ashley Madison to 2012 voter registration rolls from five U.S. states, we found 80,000 matches between 200,000 Ashley Madison user accounts and 50 million voters. According to simple rates in the sample, and also to predictively validated regression models controlling for state, gender, and age, we found that Democrats were least likely to use Ashley Madison, Libertarians were most likely, and Republicans, Greens, and unaffiliated voters were in between. Our results provide support for theories arguing that people with stricter sexual attitudes are paradoxically more likely to engage in deviant sexual behavior.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Journal reference: Selection on attainment? Local authorities, pupil backgrounds, attainment and grammar school opportunities Binwei Lu Published online: 12 Jul 2018 DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00131911.2018.1483893 Link: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00131911.2018.1483893 ABSTRACT This paper uses the National Pupil Database to explore how grammar school opportunities vary among pupil groups, and how grammar school opportunities correlate with the Local Authorities (LAs), pupil backgrounds and attainment. The results show that grammar school admission is relatively fair, based on its selection criterion, but there is no evidence that grammar schools can promote social mobility by providing more opportunities for disadvantaged pupils, which is the major claim supporting their expansion. Snapshots of grammar school opportunities in each LA, and the probability of attending grammar schools for four pupil subgroups, are examined. Then logistic regression models controlling for pupil backgrounds and attainment are created. Findings reveal that the varied proportion of grammar school places in each LA leads to unbalanced grammar school opportunities between them, making the difficulty of attending grammar schools diverse. The difference in grammar school opportunities between LAs has benefited a group of pupils moving outside their home LAs for secondary education, usually from more advantaged families. In LAs selecting more than 20% of their pupils into grammar schools, pupils eligible for free school meals, pupils with special educational needs, native English speakers and white pupils are less likely to go to grammar schools, while those from richer areas, from minority ethnic groups and those younger within a year group have higher chances when controlled for prior attainment. The difference in grammar school opportunities between social groups is largely the stratification of early-age attainment, and is unlikely the result of deliberately biased selection process.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The title of the post is a copy and paste from the first paragraph of the linked academic press release here :  gt; Job applicants who want to appear calm and collected might be at a disadvantage. According to a new Stanford study, American employers are more likely to favor excited over relaxed candidates. Journal Reference: Should job applicants be excited or calm? The role of culture and ideal affect in employment settings. Bencharit, Lucy Zhang,Ho, Yuen Wan,Fung, Helene H.,Yeung, Dannii Y.,Stephens, Nicole M.,Romero-Canyas, Rainer,Tsai, Jeanne L. Emotion, Jul 05 , 2018, DOI: 10.1037%2Femo0000444 Link: http://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Femo0000444 Abstract Do cultural differences in emotion play a role in employment settings? We predicted that cultural differences in ideal affect #8212;the states that people value and ideally want to feel #8212;are reflected in: (a) how individuals present themselves when applying for a job, and (b) what individuals look for when hiring someone for a job. In Studies 1 #8211;2 (NS1 = 236, NS2 = 174), European Americans wanted to convey high arousal positive states (HAP; excitement) more and low arousal positive states (LAP; calm) less than did Hong Kong Chinese when applying for a job. European Americans also used more HAP words in their applications and showed more  #8220;high intensity #8221; smiles in their video introductions than did Hong Kong Chinese. In Study 3 (N = 185), European American working adults rated their ideal job applicant as being more HAP and less LAP than did Hong Kong Chinese, and in Study 4a (N = 125), European American Masters of Business Administration (MBAs) were more likely to hire an excited (vs. calm) applicant for a hypothetical internship than were Hong Kong Chinese MBAs. Finally, in Study 4b (N = 300), employees in a U.S. company were more likely to hire an excited (vs. calm) applicant for a hypothetical internship. In Studies 1 #8211;4a, observed differences were partly related to European Americans valuing HAP more than Hong Kong Chinese. These findings support our predictions that culture and ideal affect shape behavior in employment settings, and have important implications for promoting cultural diversity in the workplace.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The title of the post is a copy and paste from the first paragraph of the linked academic press release here :  gt; Job applicants who want to appear calm and collected might be at a disadvantage. According to a new Stanford study, American employers are more likely to favor excited over relaxed candidates. Journal Reference: Should job applicants be excited or calm? The role of culture and ideal affect in employment settings. Bencharit, Lucy Zhang,Ho, Yuen Wan,Fung, Helene H.,Yeung, Dannii Y.,Stephens, Nicole M.,Romero-Canyas, Rainer,Tsai, Jeanne L.

We predicted that cultural differences in ideal affect #8212;the states that people value and ideally want to feel #8212;are reflected in: (a) how individuals present themselves when applying for a job, and (b) what individuals look for when hiring someone for a job.

MacDonald III3, Mark J. Thomas2,3, A.

This dedicated time, known as the  #8220;sunk cost, #8221; reduces the likelihood of giving up the pursuit of a reward, even when there is no indication of likely success. Sweis et al. show that this sensitivity to time invested occurs similarly in mice, rats, and humans (see the Perspective by Brosnan). All three display a resistance to giving up their pursuit of a reward in a foraging context, but only after they have made the decision to pursue the reward. Abstract Sunk costs are irrecoverable investments that should not influence decisions, because decisions should be made on the basis of expected future consequences. Both human and nonhuman animals can show sensitivity to sunk costs, but reports from across species are inconsistent. In a temporal context, a sensitivity to sunk costs arises when an individual resists ending an activity, even if it seems unproductive, because of the time already invested. In two parallel foraging tasks that we designed, we found that mice, rats, and humans show similar sensitivities to sunk costs in their decision-making. Unexpectedly, sensitivity to time invested accrued only after an initial decision had been made. These findings suggest that sensitivity to temporal sunk costs lies in a vulnerability distinct from deliberation processes and that this distinction is present across species.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Journal Reference: Michael Laakasuo, Marianna Drosinou, Mika Koverola, Anton Kunnari, Juho Halonen, Noora Lehtonen, Jussi Palom #228;ki. What makes people approve or condemn mind upload technology? Untangling the effects of sexual disgust, purity and science fiction familiarity. Palgrave Communications, 2018; 4 (1) DOI: 10.1057/s41599-018-0124-6 Link: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-018-0124-6 Abstract The idea of separating a person #8217;s consciousness and transferring it to another medium #8212;'mind upload' #8212;is being actively discussed in science, philosophy, and science fiction. Mind upload technologies are currently also being developed by private companies in Silicon Valley, and similar technological developments have received significant funding in the EU. Mind upload has important existential and ethical implications, yet little is known about how ordinary people actually feel about it. The current paper aims to provide a thorough moral psychological evaluation about various cognitive factors that explain people #8217;s feelings and reactions towards the use of mind upload technology. In four studies (including pilot) with a total of 952 participants, it was shown that biological and cultural cognitive factors help to determine how strongly people condemn mind upload. Both experimental manipulations in a laboratory and cross-sectional correlative online study designs were employed. The results showed that people who value purity norms and have higher sexual disgust sensitivity are more inclined to condemn mind upload. Furthermore, people who are anxious about death and condemn suicidal acts were more accepting of mind upload. Finally, higher science fiction literacy and/or hobbyism strongly predicted approval of mind upload. Several possible confounding factors were ruled out, including personality, values, individual tendencies towards rationality, and theory of mind capacities. Possible idiosyncrasies in the stimulus materials (whether consciousness is uploaded onto a computer, chimpanzee, artificial brain, or android; and whether the person #8217;s body physically dies during the process) were ruled out. The core findings inform ongoing philosophical discussions on how mind upload could (or should) be used in the future, and imply that mind upload is a much more salient topic for the general population than previously thought.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The title of the post is a copy and paste from the first and fourteenth paragraphs of the linked academic press release here :  gt; Using the power and synergy of two space telescopes, astronomers have made the most precise measurement to date of the universe #8217;s expansion rate.  gt; Using Hubble and newly released data from Gaia, Riess #8217; team measured the present rate of expansion to be 73.5 kilometers (45.6 miles) per second per megaparsec. This means that for every 3.3 million light-years farther away a galaxy is from us, it appears to be moving 73.5 kilometers per second faster. Journal Reference: Adam G. Riess, Stefano Casertano, Wenlong Yuan, Lucas Macri, Beatrice Bucciarelli, Mario G. Lattanzi, John W. MacKenty, J. Bradley Bowers, WeiKang Zheng, Alexei V. Filippenko, Caroline Huang, Richard I. Anderson. Milky Way Cepheid Standards for Measuring Cosmic Distances and Application to Gaia DR2: Implications for the Hubble Constant. The Astrophysical Journal, 2018; 861 (2): 126 DOI: 10.3847/1538-4357/aac82e Link: http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/aac82e/meta Abstract We present Hubble Space Telescope (HST) photometry of a selected sample of 50 long-period, low-extinction Milky Way Cepheids measured on the same WFC3 F555W-, F814W-, and F160W-band photometric system as extragalactic Cepheids in Type Ia supernova host galaxies. These bright Cepheids were observed with the WFC3 spatial scanning mode in the optical and near-infrared to mitigate saturation and reduce pixel-to-pixel calibration errors to reach a mean photometric error of 5 mmag per observation. We use the new Gaia DR2 parallaxes and HST photometry to simultaneously constrain the cosmic distance scale and to measure the DR2 parallax zeropoint offset appropriate for Cepheids. We find the latter to be  #8722;46  #177; 13  #956;as or  #177;6  #956;as for a fixed distance scale, higher than found from quasars, as expected for these brighter and redder sources. The precision of the distance scale from DR2 has been reduced by a factor of 2.5 because of the need to independently determine the parallax offset. The best-fit distance scale is 1.006  #177; 0.033, relative to the scale from Riess et al. with H 0 = 73.24 km s #8722;1 Mpc #8722;1 used to predict the parallaxes photometrically, and is inconsistent with the scale needed to match the Planck 2016 cosmic microwave background data combined with  #923;CDM at the 2.9 #963; confidence level (99.6%). At 96.5% confidence we find that the formal DR2 errors may be underestimated as indicated. We identify additional errors associated with the use of augmented Cepheid samples utilizing ground-based photometry and discuss their likely origins. Including the DR2 parallaxes with all prior distance-ladder data raises the current tension between the late and early universe route to the Hubble constant to 3.8 #963; (99.99%). With the final expected precision from Gaia, the sample of 50 Cepheids with HST photometry will limit to 0.5% the contribution of the first rung of the distance ladder to the uncertainty in H 0.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Journal Reference: Isabelle M. C #244;t #233;, Emily S. Darling. Scientists on Twitter: Preaching to the choir or singing from the rooftops? FACETS, 2018; 3 (1): 682 DOI: 10.1139/facets-2018-0002 Link: http://www.facetsjournal.com/doi/10.1139/facets-2018-0002 Abstract There have been strong calls for scientists to share their discoveries with society. Some scientists have heeded these calls through social media platforms such as Twitter. Here, we ask whether Twitter allows scientists to promote their findings primarily to other scientists ( #8220;inreach #8221;), or whether it can help them reach broader, non-scientific audiences ( #8220;outreach #8221;). We analyzed the Twitter followers of more than 100 faculty members in ecology and evolutionary biology and found that their followers are, on average, predominantly ( #8764;55%) other scientists. However, beyond a threshold of  #8764;1000 followers, the range of follower types became more diverse and included research and educational organizations, media, members of the public with no stated association with science, and a small number of decision-makers. This varied audience was, in turn, followed by more people, resulting in an exponential increase in the social media reach of tweeting academic scientists. Tweeting, therefore, has the potential to disseminate scientific information widely after initial efforts to gain followers. These results should encourage scientists to invest in building a social media presence for scientific outreach.</TEXT>

The survey included the PTSD checklist for the DSM #8208;5 (PCL #8208;5), the Critical Incident History Questionnaire, and the Work Environment Inventory. Results We found 19% of the sample met the criteria for diagnosable PTSD. Several risk factors were associated with a higher PCL #8208;5 score, including exposure to critical incidents, and having greater ambiguity in the job role. Being happy with job assignments and having positive relationships with supervisors and coworkers were associated with decreased PCL #8208;5 score. Conclusions Prison employees have a PTSD rate equivalent to Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans and higher than police officers, suggesting the importance of developing programs for promoting resilience to stress, incorporating the knowledge gained on risk, and protective factors.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The title of the post is a copy and paste from the second and third paragraphs of the linked academic press release here :  gt; The study, published in the Journal of the National Medical Association, finds states with greater residential segregation of black and white populations have higher racial disparities in firearm homicide fatalities. The study is one of the first to examine the relationship between racial residential segregation and firearm homicide fatalities at a state level over a 25-year period, and controlled for multiple race-specific measures of deprivation in education, employment, economic status, and housing.  gt;  #8220;It was important for us to analyze this at the state level, because in the past we #8217;ve found that a black person living in Wisconsin has a 22-fold higher risk of being fatally shot compared to a white person, but in New Mexico a black person has a 2-fold higher risk of being fatally shot compared to a white person, #8221; says pre-doctoral fellow Anita Knopov, the study #8217;s lead author. Journal Reference: The Role of Racial Residential Segregation in Black-White Disparities in Firearm Homicide at the State Level in the United States, 1991-2015 Anita Knopov, B.A.correspondenceEmail the author B.A. Anita Knopov, Emily F.

Methods Using a linear regression, we evaluated the relationship between racial residential segregation, as measured by the index of dissimilarity, and the Black-White firearm homicide disparity ratio in 32 states over the period 1991-2015. To account for clustering of observations within states, we used a generalized estimating equations approach. Results After controlling for measures of White and Black deprivation, multivariate analysis showed that racial segregation was positively associated with the Black-White firearm homicide disparity. For each 10-point increase in the index of dissimilarity, the ratio of Black to White firearm homicide rates in a state increased by 39%. After controlling for levels of White and Black deprivation, racial segregation remained negatively associated with White firearm homicide rates and positively associated with Black firearm homicide rates. Conclusions These findings suggest that racial segregation may increase the disparity in firearm homicide between the Black and White population.</TEXT>

JAMA Dermatology, 2018; DOI: 10.1001/jamadermatol.2018.1748 Link: https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamadermatology/article-abstract/2686148 Key Points Question Does the 9-valent human papillomavirus vaccine have therapeutic utility for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma? Findings A woman in her 90s with multiple cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas was treated with the 9-valent human papillomavirus vaccine systemically and intratumorally. This approach led to regression of all tumors. Meaning These findings suggest that the 9-valent human papillomavirus vaccine could be a therapeutic option for patients with cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma when surgical management is not an option. Abstract Importance Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is the second most common form of skin cancer, and its incidence is increasing. When surgical management is not an option, finding a safe and efficacious treatment is a challenge. Mounting evidence suggests that the human papillomavirus (HPV) is involved in the pathogenesis of some SCCs. Objective To assess whether the 9-valent HPV vaccine could be an effective treatment strategy for cutaneous SCC. Design, Setting, and Participants A woman in her 90s with multiple, inoperable cutaneous basaloid SCCs was successfully treated at a university-based outpatient dermatology clinic with a combination of systemic and intratumoral delivery of the 9-valent HPV vaccine from March 17, 2016, through February 27, 2017, and then followed up through May 21, 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures Reduction in tumor size and number after a combination of systemic and intratumoral administration of the HPV vaccine. Results All tumors resolved 11 months after the first intratumoral injection of the vaccine. The patient remained free of tumors at the end of follow-up. Conclusions and Relevance This is the first report, to our knowledge, of complete regression of a cutaneous malignant tumor after combined systemic and direct intratumoral injection of the 9-valent HPV vaccine. This report suggests that the HPV vaccine may have therapeutic utility for SCCs in patients who are poor surgical candidates, have multiple lesions, or defer surgery.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Journal reference: Enforcing Christian Nationalism: Examining the Link Between Group Identity and Punitive Attitudes in the United States Joshua Davis Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion 2018 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1111/jssr.12510 Link: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jssr.12510 Abstract This article examines whether the convergence of an individual's religious and national identities promotes authoritarian attitudes towards crime and deviance. Drawing on theories of social control and group conformity, as well as Christian nationalism's influence on intolerance toward out #8208;groups, I argue that the inability to distinguish between religious and national identities increases desire for group homogeneity and therefore increases willingness to utilize formalized measures of social control. Analysis of 2007 Baylor Religion Survey data demonstrates that adherence to Christian nationalism predicts three indicators of authoritarian views toward controlling crime and deviance: support for capital punishment, stricter punishment for federal crime, and for society to  #8220;crackdown on troublemakers. #8221; These effects are robust to the inclusion of a comprehensive battery of 20 socioeconomic, political, and religious controls, and are consistent with previous research on Christian nationalism showing it is not religious commitment or traditionalism per se that leads to intolerant attitudes, but rather the conflation of one's religious identity with other social identities, in this case national. These findings indicate that, beyond sociopolitical and religious influences, the belief that the United States is, and should be, a  #8220;Christian nation #8221; increases desires for group conformity and strict control for both criminals and  #8220;troublemakers. #8221;</TEXT>

The Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine, 2018; 31 (4): 529 DOI: 10.3122/jabfm.2018.04.170360 Link: http://www.jabfm.org/content/31/4/529 Abstract Background: Little is known about the prevalence and correlates of burnout among providers who work in small independent primary care practices ( lt;5 providers). Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis by using data collected from 235 providers practicing in 174 small independent primary care practices in New York City. Results: The rate of provider-reported burnout was 13.5%. Using bivariate logistic regression, we found higher adaptive reserve scores were associated with lower odds of burnout (odds ratio, 0.12; 95% CI, 0.02 #8211;0.85; P = .034). Conclusion: The burnout rate was relatively low among our sample of providers compared with previous surveys that focused primarily on larger practices. The independence and autonomy providers have in these small practices may provide some protection against symptoms of burnout. In addition, the relationship between adaptive reserve and lower rates of burnout point toward potential interventions for reducing burnout that include strengthening primary care practices' learning and development capacity.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>1. I #8217;m located in Melbourne, Australia, so +10 AEST. I surf Reddit mostly before I sleep when I #8217;m exercising. I also go on it when I wake up although more briefly and between and during meetings at work. 2. To be honest the sub is great at the moment. There #8217;s a good mix of great pics, scientific articles and interesting discussion posts. I try to contribute to the sub as a poster and hope that I #8217;ve helped add interesting content to the community. 3. The best part of /r/space is that it #8217;s about space! I love space and have dreamt of being an astronaut. In terms of improvement, I would consider adding both post flair that can be selected by users to subcategorise their posts for easier searching eg. astronomy, policy, photos, news, etc. Also consider user flairs for those who can be verified to work in the space industry eg. astronaut, engineer, physicist, astronomer, amateur enthusiasts etc. 4. Yes. /r/science and /r/futurology , also everythingscience, health, askscience amongst others. I #8217;m most active on /r/futurology. I use RES and mod tools on desktop but nowadays I do most of my modding using the Reddit app. 5. Yes. I #8217;m already on it for the other subs I mod (also discord as well). Thanks for the invitation and for your kind consideration. :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The title of the post is a copy and paste from the first and fourth paragraphs of the linked academic press release here :  gt; Narcissistic people tend to respond differently to infidelity depending on whether they #8217;re grandiose or vulnerable narcissists, according to new research published in the Journal of Social and Personal Relationships.  gt;  #8220;Both  #8216;grandiose #8217; and  #8216;vulnerable #8217; narcissists seem intent on pursuing power and control over their romantic partners, but vulnerable narcissists also seek reassurance, relational security, and compensation for a tenuous self-worth. #8221; Journal Reference: Modeling the interplay between narcissism, relational motives, and jealousy-induced responses to infidelity threat Gregory K. Tortoriello, William Hart Journal of Social and Personal Relationships 2018 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1177/0265407518783096 Link: http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0265407518783096 Abstract Threat-based accounts of narcissism postulate enhanced worrying and negative emotion following threat. The present study examined whether the psychological process by which people experience and respond to jealousy-inducing threats varies according to their narcissism subtype. Participants completed measures of grandiose and vulnerable narcissism, simulated sexual and emotional infidelity scenarios, and reported their anticipated (a) motives (power/control, relational security, self-esteem compensation, uncertainty minimization) and (b) jealousy responses (worrying, negative emotions, and behavioral tactics). Path modeling conditionally supported threat-based accounts for the vulnerable subtype but not for the grandiose subtype. Grandiose narcissism (marginally) inversely related to a composite of worrying and negative emotion but (directly) positively related to power/control motives and, in turn, attacking/restricting tactics. Effects of vulnerable narcissism on jealousy outcomes depended on infidelity type. Vis- #224;-vis emotional infidelity, vulnerable narcissism positively related to worrying and negative emotion and, in turn, related to heightened pursuit of all motives, some of which uniquely predicted heightened attacking/restricting tactics, suppressed attacking/restricting tactics, and heightened enhancing tactics. Vis- #224;-vis sexual infidelity, effects of vulnerable narcissism mimicked those of grandiose narcissism. In jealousy contexts, extant threat-based accounts of narcissism appear inadequate for explaining the grandiose subtype and evidently bounded for explaining the vulnerable subtype.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Journal reference: Christopher D. Nye, Jessamyn G. Perlus, James Rounds, Do ornithologists flock together? Examining the homogeneity of interests in occupations, Journal of Vocational Behavior, Volume 107, 2018, Pages 195-208, ISSN 0001-8791, DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvb.2018.04.004. Link: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001879118300447 Abstract: Theory and research on person-environment fit suggest that people in the same environment should share homogeneous patterns of individual characteristics. The concept of homogeneity is central to the notion that individuals can be matched to occupations or academic fields of study and will be satisfied with and successful in environments in which they fit. This idea has been particularly influential in research on vocational interests where interest scores are used for career planning and employee selection. Nevertheless, if interests are to be useful for these purposes, it is important to verify the degree to which employees in occupations have homogeneous interest profiles. The current study addresses this question by looking at homogeneity from two different perspectives: examination of the Strong Interest Inventory manual data and a quantitative review of congruence indices. Taken together, these findings contradict the foundational assumption of interest homogeneity by demonstrating considerable heterogeneity of interests in a range of occupations. These results suggest that a continuum of homogeneity exists and prompt a further look into the homogeneity assumption of interests within occupations.</TEXT>

The same study found that a good mood has a negative effect on it in some cases. Journal Reference: Martyn S. Gabel, Tara McAuley. Does mood help or hinder executive functions? Reactivity may be the key. Personality and Individual Differences, 2018; 128: 94 DOI: 10.1016/j.paid.2018.02.027 Link: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S019188691830093X?via%3Dihub Abstract Our ability to utilize executive functioning (EF) in day-to-day life is influenced by our mood, which consists of two fundamental dimensions reflecting positive and negative affect. It remains unclear, however, what impact these affective experiences have on our executive skills and whether this association may be influenced by individual differences in emotional reactivity. Our study investigated the interplay of emotional reactivity, naturally occurring variations in affective dimensions underlying mood, and latent constructs of response inhibition and working memory in an undergraduate sample. Reactivity moderated an association between negative affect and EF, such that high-reactive individuals performed better on EF tasks when experiencing high levels of negative affect whereas low-reactive individuals showed the converse pattern. These results are discussed through the lens of mood-related effects on information processing styles and the availability of cognitive resources to cope with current situational demands. An implication of this work is that emotional reactivity is an important factor in understanding how affective experiences influence executive skills and, by extension, everyday function.</TEXT>

Link: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214993718300927 Abstract: In this study, a novel peat composite construction material suitable for three-dimensional printing of entire house boxes (walls, floors, ceilings, etc.) was developed. Peat was used as filler to achieve excellent thermal properties. Using peat for this purpose has not been mentioned in the earlier literature because it retarding properties to the cementation process. As a binder, combustion fly ash was used. The retarding properties of peat humic substances on hardening of pozzolanic mixtures were successfully overcome by using silica fume as an additive. The same additive also greatly improved the long setting time of oil shale ash. The mechanism of hardening of the composite material was hypothesized as the following: first, upon contact with water, the pH of pore water exceeded 13 due to the high content of oxides of alkali metals in the ash, which promoted the oxidation of humates into oxalate. Then, alkali metal, aluminum and silicate ions (the latter mostly originating from silica fume) with alumina formed insoluble feldspars leading to a decrease in pH. At pH values lower than 12.4, Ca(OH)2 became soluble and Ca2+ ions migrated to the liquid phase, allowing pozzolanic reactions to occur and calcium oxalate to precipitate. Finally, the residual Ca(OH)2 reacted with atmospheric CO2 to form CaCO3. Test samples were 3D-printed using experimental apparatus, the printing head involved a nozzle delivering wet peat-ash mixture using compressed air. The material was characterized by measuring its thermal resistance ( lt;0.08 #8239;W/(m #8239;K)), compressive and bending strengths (1.2 #8239;MPa and 0.36 #8239;N/mm2, respectively). Using peat composites in the construction industry allows reducing CO2 emissions from partially mined peatlands (currently the one of the largest contributors to the total CO2 emission from Estonia) and increasing the reuse of oil shale ash while providing a cheap and affordable raw material.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Journal article: Undervaluing Gratitude: Expressers Misunderstand the Consequences of Showing Appreciation Amit Kumar, Nicholas Epley Psychological Science 2018 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1177/0956797618772506 Link: http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956797618772506 Abstract Expressing gratitude improves well-being for both expressers and recipients, but we suggest that an egocentric bias may lead expressers to systematically undervalue its positive impact on recipients in a way that could keep people from expressing gratitude more often in everyday life. Participants in three experiments wrote gratitude letters and then predicted how surprised, happy, and awkward recipients would feel. Recipients then reported how receiving an expression of gratitude actually made them feel. Expressers significantly underestimated how surprised recipients would be about why expressers were grateful, overestimated how awkward recipients would feel, and underestimated how positive recipients would feel. Expected awkwardness and mood were both correlated with participants #8217; willingness to express gratitude. Wise decisions are guided by an accurate assessment of the expected value of action. Underestimating the value of prosocial actions, such as expressing gratitude, may keep people from engaging in behavior that would maximize their own #8212;and others #8217; #8212;well-being.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The title of the post is a copy and paste from the first two paragraphs of the linked academic press release here :  gt; Men may recover more quickly from influenza infections because they produce more of a key lung-healing protein, a study from scientists at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health suggests.  gt; The scientists, whose findings are published online in Biology of Sex Differences on July 17, infected live mice and human cells derived from male humans with influenza virus, and found that both the male mice and human cells produced more amphiregulin, a growth factor protein important in wound healing. The male mice recovered more quickly, compared to female mice, whereas male mice lacking amphiregulin had recovery times close to those of females. Journal Reference: Meghan S. Vermillion, Rebecca L. Ursin, Denise I. T. Kuok, Landon G. vom Steeg, Nicholas Wohlgemuth, Olivia J. Hall, Ashley L. Fink, Eric Sasse, Andrew Nelson, Roland Ndeh, Sharon McGrath-Morrow, Wayne Mitzner, Michael C. W. Chan, Andrew Pekosz, Sabra L. Klein. Production of amphiregulin and recovery from influenza is greater in males than females. Biology of Sex Differences, 2018; 9 (1) DOI: 10.1186/s13293-018-0184-8 Link: https://bsd.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13293-018-0184-8 Abstract Background Amphiregulin (AREG) is an epidermal growth factor that is a significant mediator of tissue repair at mucosal sites, including in the lungs during influenza A virus (IAV) infection. Previous research illustrates that males of reproductive ages experience less severe disease and recover faster than females following infection with IAV. Methods Whether males and females differentially produce and utilize AREG for pulmonary repair after IAV infection was investigated using murine models on a C57BL/6 background and primary mouse and human epithelial cell culture systems. Results Following sublethal infection with 2009 H1N1 IAV, adult female mice experienced greater morbidity and pulmonary inflammation during the acute phase of infection as well as worse pulmonary function during the recovery phase of infection than males, despite having similar virus clearance kinetics. As compared with females, AREG expression was greater in the lungs of male mice as well as in primary respiratory epithelial cells derived from mouse and human male donors, in response to H1N1 IAVs. Internalization of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) was also greater in respiratory epithelial cells derived from male than female mice. IAV infection of Areg knock-out (Areg #8722;/ #8722;) mice eliminated sex differences in IAV pathogenesis, with a more significant role for AREG in infection of male compared to female mice. Deletion of Areg had no effect on virus replication kinetics in either sex. Gonadectomy and treatment of either wild-type or Areg #8722;/ #8722; males with testosterone improved the outcome of IAV as compared with their placebo-treated conspecifics. Conclusions Taken together, these data show that elevated levels of testosterone and AREG, either independently or in combination, improve resilience (i.e., repair and recovery of damaged tissue) and contribute to better influenza outcomes in males compared with females.</TEXT>

Abstract The present research explores the effect of an ambient coffee-like scent (versus no scent) on expectations regarding performance on an analytical reasoning task as well as on actual performance. We show that people in a coffee-scented (versus unscented) environment perform better on an analytical reasoning task due to heightened performance expectations (Study 1). We further show that people expect that being in a coffee-scented environment will increase their performance because they expect it will increase their physiological arousal level (Study 2). Our results thus demonstrate that a coffee-like scent (which actually contains no caffeine) can elicit a placebo effect.</TEXT>

We assessed whether timing of meals is associated with breast and prostate cancer risk taking into account lifestyle and chronotype, a characteristic correlating with preference for morning or evening activity. We conducted a population #8208;based case #8208;control study in Spain, 2008 #8211;2013. In this analysis we included 621 cases of prostate and 1,205 of breast cancer and 872 male and 1,321 female population controls who had never worked night shift. Subjects were interviewed on timing of meals, sleep and chronotype and completed a Food Frequency Questionaire. Adherence to the World Cancer Research Fund/American Institute of Cancer Research recommendations for cancer prevention was examined. Compared with subjects sleeping immediately after supper, those sleeping two or more hours after supper had a 20% reduction in cancer risk for breast and prostate cancer combined (adjusted Odds Ratio [OR] = 0.80, 95%CI 0.67 #8211;0.96) and in each cancer individually (prostate cancer OR = 0.74, 0.55 #8211;0.99; breast cancer OR = 0.84, 0.67 #8211;1.06). A similar protection was observed in subjects having supper before 9 pm compared with supper after 10 pm. The effect of longer supper #8208;sleep interval was more pronounced among subjects adhering to cancer prevention recommendations (OR both cancers= 0.65, 0.44 #8211;0.97) and in morning types (OR both cancers = 0.66, 0.49 #8211;0.90). Adherence to diurnal eating patterns and specifically a long interval between last meal and sleep are associated with a lower cancer risk, stressing the importance of evaluating timing in studies on diet and cancer.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Journal reference: Inhaled bacteriophage-loaded polymeric microparticles ameliorate acute lung infections Rachit Agarwal, Christopher T. Johnson Nature Biomedical Engineering (2018) DOI: 10.1038/s41551-018-0263-5 Link: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-018-0263-5 Abstract Lung infections associated with pneumonia, or cystic fibrosis caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa or other bacteria, result in significant morbidity and mortality, in part owing to the development of multidrug resistance, also against last-resort antibiotics. Lytic bacteriophages (that is, viruses that specifically kill bacteria) can reduce lung-associated infections, yet their clinical use is hindered by difficulties in delivering active phages to the deep lung. Here, we show that phage-loaded polymeric microparticles deposit throughout the lung via dry powder inhalation and that they deliver active phages. Phage-loaded microparticles effectively reduced P. aeruginosa infections and the associated inflammation in wild-type and cystic fibrosis transmembrane-conductance-regulator knockout mice, and rescued the mice from pneumonia-associated death. These polymeric microparticles might constitute a clinically translatable therapy for eradicating hospital-acquired lung infections and infections associated with cystic fibrosis.</TEXT>

Analgesic alternatives are being explored in response to an epidemic of opioid misuse. Low #8208;dose ketamine (LDK) is one opioid alternative for the treatment of acute pain in the ED. Objectives This systematic review and meta #8208;analysis sought to quantify whether LDK is an effective and safe opioid alternative for acute pain reduction in adults in the ED setting. (PROSPERO Registration Number CRD42017065303). Methods This was a systematic review of randomized controlled trials comparing intravenous opioids to LDK for relief of acute pain in the ED. Studies where the control group initially received opioids prior to ketamine were excluded. A research librarian designed the electronic search strategy. Changes in visual analog scale or numeric rating scale pain scales were analyzed to determine the relative effects of LDK and opioids in the treatment of acute pain. Results Three studies met the criteria for inclusion in this meta #8208;analysis. Compared to pain scale reduction with morphine, ketamine was not inferior (relative reduction = 0.42, 95% confidence interval =  #8211;0.70 to 1.54). No severe adverse events were reported in any study, but higher rates of nonsevere adverse events were observed with ketamine. Conclusions Ketamine is noninferior to morphine for the control of acute pain, indicating that ketamine can be considered as an alternative to opioids for ED short #8208;term pain control.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Journal reference: Anti #8208;tumoural actions of cannabinoids Burkhard Hinz Robert Ramer British Journal of Pharmacology 2018 First published: 17 July 2018 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1111/bph.14426 Link: https://bpspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/bph.14426 Abstract The endocannabinoid system has emerged as a considerable target for the treatment of diverse diseases. In addition to the well #8208;established palliative effects of cannabinoids in cancer therapy, phytocannabinoids, synthetic cannabinoid compounds as well as inhibitors of endocannabinoid degradation have attracted attention as possible systemic anticancer drugs. As a matter of fact, accumulating data from preclinical studies suggest cannabinoids elicit effects on different levels of cancer progression, comprising inhibition of proliferation, neovascularisation, invasion and chemoresistance, induction of apoptosis and autophagy as well as enhancement of tumour immune surveillance. Although the clinical use of cannabinoid receptor ligands is limited by their psychoactivity, nonpsychoactive compounds, such as cannabidiol, have gained attention due to preclinically established anticancer properties and a favourable risk #8208;to #8208;benefit profile. Thus, cannabinoids may complement the currently used collection of chemotherapeutics, as a broadly diversified option for cancer treatment, while counteracting some of their severe side effects.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The title of the post is a copy and paste from the title, subtitle and second paragraph of the linked academic press release here :  gt; Fish Consumption May Prolong Life  gt; Consumption of fish and long-chain omega-3 fatty acids was associated with lower risks of early death in a Journal of Internal Medicine study.  gt; In the study of 240,729 men and 180,580 women who were followed for 16 years, 54,230 men and 30,882 women died. Higher fish and long-chain omega-3 fatty acid intakes were significantly associated with lower total mortality. Comparing the highest with lowest quintiles of fish intake, men had 9% lower total mortality, 10% lower cardiovascular disease mortality, 6% lower cancer mortality, 20% lower respiratory disease mortality, and 37% lower chronic liver disease mortality, while women had 8% lower total mortality, 10% lower cardiovascular disease mortality, and 38% lower Alzheimer's disease mortality. Journal Reference: Y. Zhang, P. Zhuang, W. He, J. N. Chen, W. Q. Wang, N. D. Freedman, C. C. Abnet, J. B. Wang, J. J. Jiao. Association of fish and long-chain omega-3 fatty acids intakes with total and cause-specific mortality: prospective analysis of 421 309 individuals. Journal of Internal Medicine, 2018; DOI: 10.1111/joim.12786 Link: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/joim.12786 Abstract Background Prevailing dietary guidelines recommend regular fish consumption. However, the associations of fish and long #8208;chain omega #8208;3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCn #8208;3 PUFAs) intakes with mortality remain unclear. Objectives To examine the associations of fish and LCn #8208;3 PUFAs intakes with total and cause #8208;specific mortality. Methods A total of 240 729 men and 180 580 women from NIH #8208;AARP Diet and Health Study were prospectively followed #8208;up for 16 years. Dietary intakes were assessed using a validated NIH Diet History Questionnaire. Results A total of 54 230 men and 30 882 women died during 6.07 million person #8208;years of follow #8208;up. Higher fish and LCn #8208;3 PUFAs intakes were significantly associated with lower total mortality (P  lt; 0.0001). Comparing the highest with lowest quintiles of fish intake, men had 9% (95% confidence interval, 6 #8211;11%) lower total mortality, 10% (6 #8211;15%) lower cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality, 6% (1 #8211;10%) lower cancer mortality, 20% (11 #8211;28%) lower respiratory disease mortality and 37% (17 #8211;53%) lower chronic liver disease mortality, while women had 8% (5 #8211;12%) lower total mortality, 10% (3 #8211;17%) lower CVD mortality and 38% (20 #8211;52%) lower Alzheimer's disease mortality. Fried fish consumption was not related to mortality in men whereas positively associated with mortality from all causes (P = 0.011), CVD and respiratory disease in women. LCn #8208;3 PUFAs intake was associated with 15% and 18% lower CVD mortality in men and women across extreme quintiles, respectively. Conclusion Consumption of fish and LCn #8208;3 PUFAs was robustly associated with lower mortality from major causes. Our findings support current guidelines for fish consumption while advice on non #8208;frying preparation methods is needed.</TEXT>

Using unsupervised factor analysis and a birth cohort approach to create a retrospective time series, we present 100-year time series of secularization in different nations, derived from recent global values surveys, which we compare by decade to historical gross domestic product figures in those nations. We find evidence that a rise in secularization generally has preceded economic growth over the past century. Our multilevel, time-lagged regressions also indicate that tolerance for individual rights predicted 20th century economic growth even better than secularization. These findings hold when we control for education and shared cultural heritage.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The title of the post is a copy and paste from the title, first and second paragraphs of the linked academic press release here :  gt; Moderate Alcohol Consumption May Boost Male Fertility  gt; In a new Andrology study, moderate alcohol intake was linked with higher semen volume, sperm concentration, and total sperm count.  gt; Compared with men drinking  lt;1 #8211;3 units per week, median semen volume was higher in the 4 #8211;7 units/week group, as was total sperm count. Journal Reference: E. Ricci, S. Noli, S. Ferrari, I. La Vecchia, S. Cipriani, V. De Cosmi, E. Somigliana, F. Parazzini. Alcohol intake and semen variables: cross-sectional analysis of a prospective cohort study of men referring to an Italian Fertility Clinic. Andrology, 2018; DOI: 10.1111/andr.12521 Link: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/andr.12521 Summary Background The association between alcohol intake and male reproductive function is still controversial. In the frame of a prospective cohort study, designed to investigate the relation between life style and fertility, we performed a cross #8208;sectional analysis of semen quality. Methods Men of subfertile couples, referring to an Italian Infertility Unit and eligible for assisted reproductive techniques (ARTs), were asked about their lifestyle: BMI, smoking, caffeine intake, occupational and leisure physical activity (PA) and alcohol intake in the last year before ART procedure. Semen volume, sperm concentration, total sperm count and sperm motility were determined. Age, risk factors for impaired male fertility, caffeine, smoking, leisure PA, days of abstinence and daily calories intake were accounted for in the analyses. Results Between September 2014 and December 2016, we enrolled 323 male patients, mean age 39.3 years. Thirty #8208;one (9.6%) were abstainers, 97 (30.0%) drank  lt;1 #8211;3, 98 (30.3%) 4 #8211;7 and 97 (30.0%)  #8805;8 alcohol units per week. As compared to men drinking  lt;1 #8211;3 units per week, median semen volume was higher in the 4 #8211;7 units/week group (3.0 mL, interquartile range, IQR, 2.0 #8211;4.0 vs. 2.4 mL, IQR 1.7 #8211;3.5), as well as total sperm count (87.9 mil/mL, IQR 20.2 #8211;182.1 vs. 51.5 mil/mL, IQR 15.2 #8211;114.7). Association with sperm concentration was also significant, with a U #8208;shaped trend in groups of alcohol intake. After adjusting for potential confounders, these relations were confirmed. Similar patterns were observed in subgroups of leisure PA and risk factors for impaired male fertility, although these estimates often lacked statistical significance, presumably because of low sample size. Conclusions Moderate alcohol intake appears positively associated to semen quality in male partners of infertile couples undergoing ARTs.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Personally I #8217;ve tried using it and have never found it useful. The chat system here adds no further value to what I can get with slack or discord. In the end, I come to Reddit for it #8217;s posts and comments, not to chat in real-time. Obviously, enabling chat won #8217;t affect the users who won #8217;t use it, besides potentially funneling content away from the sub, which I doubt, but as you say, it will divert moderating effort from the sub. There may be additional users who may be interested in being dedicated chat mods which may mitigate this. I think the mod team will need to consider that seriously. Unofficial discord servers already exists, and other subs have gone down setting up  #8220;official #8221; sub discord servers so that #8217;s another option. Abrownn is aware of the futurology one we have set up for example, although it #8217;s not that active. Hope this helps a bit.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The title of the post is a copy and paste from the title and sixth paragraph of the linked academic press release here :  gt; Three-week diary study: sex today increases sense of meaning in life tomorrow  gt; They found that having sex on one day was associated with more positive mood states the following day, and also a greater feeling that life is meaningful (the converse wasn #8217;t true  #8211; positive moods or more meaning in life one day was not associated with more sex the next). Journal Reference: Kashdan, T. B., Goodman, F. R., Stiksma, M., Milius, C. R.,  amp; McKnight, P. E. (2018). Sexuality leads to boosts in mood and meaning in life with no evidence for the reverse direction: A daily diary investigation. Emotion, 18(4), 563-576. DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/emo0000324 Link: http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-25711-001 Abstract Sex is rarely discussed in theories of well-being and rarely empirically examined using methods other than cross-sectional surveys. In the present study, a daily diary approach was used (for 21 days with 152 adults) to explore the relationship between the presence and quality of sexual episodes and well-being (positive affect, negative affect, meaning in life). Time-lagged analyses demonstrated that sexual activity on 1 day was related to greater well-being the next. As for the quality of episodes, higher reported sexual pleasure and intimacy predicted greater positive affect and lower negative affect the following day. When the reverse direction was tested, well-being did not predict next-day sexual activity, pleasure, or intimacy. These results suggest a unidirectional relationship in which the presence and quality of sexual activity lead to gains in well-being the following day. Contextual moderators (gender, relationship status, relationship closeness, and relationship length) allowed for tests of conditions altering the link between sexuality and well-being. Relationship closeness was the most robust moderator in predicting greater levels of meaning in life and positive affect following sexual episodes. These data provide evidence to support the continual consideration of sex in empirical work and theoretical models of elements that comprise healthy relationships and a good life.</TEXT>

Mechanistically, these treatments transformed this injury-induced dysfunctional spinal circuit to a functional state, facilitating the relay of brain-derived commands toward the lumbar spinal cord. Thus, our results identify spinal inhibitory interneurons as a roadblock limiting the integration of descending inputs into relay circuits after injury and suggest KCC2 agonists as promising treatments for promoting functional recovery after spinal cord injury.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The title of the post is a copy and paste from the first paragraph of the linked academic press release here :  gt; On average, patients get about 11 seconds to explain the reasons for their visit before they are interrupted by their doctors. Also, only one in three doctors provides their patients with adequate opportunity to describe their situation. The pressure to rush consultations affects specialists more than primary care doctors says Naykky Singh Ospina of the University of Florida, Gainesville and the Mayo Clinic in the US. Journal Reference: Naykky Singh Ospina, Kari A. Phillips, Rene Rodriguez-Gutierrez, Ana Castaneda-Guarderas, Michael R. Gionfriddo, Megan E. Branda, Victor M. Montori. Eliciting the Patient #8217;s Agenda- Secondary Analysis of Recorded Clinical Encounters. Journal of General Internal Medicine, 2018; DOI: 10.1007/s11606-018-4540-5 Link: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11606-018-4540-5 Abstract Background Eliciting patient concerns and listening carefully to them contributes to patient-centered care. Yet, clinicians often fail to elicit the patient #8217;s agenda and, when they do, they interrupt the patient #8217;s discourse. Objective We aimed to describe the extent to which patients #8217; concerns are elicited across different clinical settings and how shared decision-making tools impact agenda elicitation. Design and Participants We performed a secondary analysis of a random sample of 112 clinical encounters recorded during trials testing the efficacy of shared decision-making tools. Main Measures Two reviewers, working independently, characterized the elicitation of the patient agenda and the time to interruption or to complete statement; we analyzed the distribution of agenda elicitation according to setting and use of shared decision-making tools. Key Results Clinicians elicited the patient #8217;s agenda in 40 of 112 (36%) encounters. Agendas were elicited more often in primary care (30/61 encounters, 49%) than in specialty care (10/51 encounters, 20%); p #8201;= #8201;.058. Shared decision-making tools did not affect the likelihood of eliciting the patient #8217;s agenda (34 vs. 37% in encounters with and without these tools; p #8201;= #8201;.09). In 27 of the 40 (67%) encounters in which clinicians elicited patient concerns, the clinician interrupted the patient after a median of 11 seconds (interquartile range 7 #8211;22; range 3 to 234 s). Uninterrupted patients took a median of 6 s (interquartile range 3 #8211;19; range 2 to 108 s) to state their concern. Conclusions Clinicians seldom elicit the patient #8217;s agenda; when they do, they interrupt patients sooner than previously reported. Physicians in specialty care elicited the patient #8217;s agenda less often compared to physicians in primary care. Failure to elicit the patient #8217;s agenda reduces the chance that clinicians will orient the priorities of a clinical encounter toward specific aspects that matter to each patient.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The title of the post is a copy and paste from the first paragraph of the linked academic press release here :  gt; On average, patients get about 11 seconds to explain the reasons for their visit before they are interrupted by their doctors. Also, only one in three doctors provides their patients with adequate opportunity to describe their situation. The pressure to rush consultations affects specialists more than primary care doctors says Naykky Singh Ospina of the University of Florida, Gainesville and the Mayo Clinic in the US. Journal Reference: Naykky Singh Ospina, Kari A. Phillips, Rene Rodriguez-Gutierrez, Ana Castaneda-Guarderas, Michael R. Gionfriddo, Megan E. Branda, Victor M. Montori. Eliciting the Patient #8217;s Agenda- Secondary Analysis of Recorded Clinical Encounters. Journal of General Internal Medicine, 2018; DOI: 10.1007/s11606-018-4540-5 Link: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11606-018-4540-5 Abstract Background Eliciting patient concerns and listening carefully to them contributes to patient-centered care. Yet, clinicians often fail to elicit the patient #8217;s agenda and, when they do, they interrupt the patient #8217;s discourse. Objective We aimed to describe the extent to which patients #8217; concerns are elicited across different clinical settings and how shared decision-making tools impact agenda elicitation. Design and Participants We performed a secondary analysis of a random sample of 112 clinical encounters recorded during trials testing the efficacy of shared decision-making tools. Main Measures Two reviewers, working independently, characterized the elicitation of the patient agenda and the time to interruption or to complete statement; we analyzed the distribution of agenda elicitation according to setting and use of shared decision-making tools. Key Results Clinicians elicited the patient #8217;s agenda in 40 of 112 (36%) encounters. Agendas were elicited more often in primary care (30/61 encounters, 49%) than in specialty care (10/51 encounters, 20%); p #8201;= #8201;.058. Shared decision-making tools did not affect the likelihood of eliciting the patient #8217;s agenda (34 vs. 37% in encounters with and without these tools; p #8201;= #8201;.09). In 27 of the 40 (67%) encounters in which clinicians elicited patient concerns, the clinician interrupted the patient after a median of 11 seconds (interquartile range 7 #8211;22; range 3 to 234 s). Uninterrupted patients took a median of 6 s (interquartile range 3 #8211;19; range 2 to 108 s) to state their concern. Conclusions Clinicians seldom elicit the patient #8217;s agenda; when they do, they interrupt patients sooner than previously reported. Physicians in specialty care elicited the patient #8217;s agenda less often compared to physicians in primary care. Failure to elicit the patient #8217;s agenda reduces the chance that clinicians will orient the priorities of a clinical encounter toward specific aspects that matter to each patient.</TEXT>

However, very little is known about the relation between video game experience and structural brain plasticity. To address this issue, a direct comparison of the white matter brain structure in RTS (real time strategy) video game players (VGPs) and non #8208;players (NVGPs) was performed. We hypothesized that RTS experience can enhance connectivity within and between occipital and parietal regions, as these regions are likely to be involved in the spatial and visual abilities that are trained while playing RTS games. The possible influence of long #8208;term RTS game play experience on brain structural connections was investigated using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and a region of interest (ROI) approach in order to describe the experience #8208;related plasticity of white matter. Our results revealed significantly more total white matter connections between occipital and parietal areas and within occipital areas in RTS players compared to NVGPs. Additionally, the RTS group had an altered topological organization of their structural network, expressed in local efficiency within the occipito #8208;parietal subnetwork. Furthermore, the positive association between network metrics and time spent playing RTS games suggests a close relationship between extensive, long #8208;term RTS game play and neuroplastic changes. These results indicate that long #8208;term and extensive RTS game experience induces alterations along axons that link structures of the occipito #8208;parietal loop involved in spatial and visual processing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The title of the post is a copy and paste from the title, second and fifth paragraphs of the linked academic press release here :  gt; Scientists reverse aging-associated skin wrinkles and hair loss in a mouse model  gt; When a mutation leading to mitochondrial dysfunction is induced, the mouse develops wrinkled skin and extensive, visible hair loss in a matter of weeks. When the mitochondrial function is restored by turning off the gene responsible for mitochondrial dysfunction, the mouse returns to smooth skin and thick fur, indistinguishable from a healthy mouse of the same age.  gt; In humans, a decline in mitochondrial function is seen during aging, and mitochondrial dysfunction can drive age-related diseases. Journal Reference: Bhupendra Singh, Trenton R. Schoeb, Prachi Bajpai, Andrzej Slominski, Keshav K. Singh. Reversing wrinkled skin and hair loss in mice by restoring mitochondrial function. Cell Death  amp; Disease, 2018; 9 (7) DOI: 10.1038/s41419-018-0765-9 Link: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41419-018-0765-9 Abstract Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) depletion is involved in mtDNA depletion syndromes, mitochondrial diseases, aging and aging-associated chronic diseases, and other human pathologies. To evaluate the consequences of depletion of mtDNA in the whole animal, we created an inducible mtDNA-depleter mouse expressing, in the polymerase domain of POLG1, a dominant-negative mutation to induce depletion of mtDNA in various tissues. These mice showed reduced mtDNA content, reduced mitochondrial gene expression, and instability of supercomplexes involved in oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) resulting in reduced OXPHOS enzymatic activities. We demonstrate that ubiquitous depletion of mtDNA in mice leads to predominant and profound effects on the skin resulting in wrinkles and visual hair loss with an increased number of dysfunctional hair follicles and inflammatory responses. Development of skin wrinkle was associated with the significant epidermal hyperplasia, hyperkeratosis, increased expression of matrix metalloproteinases, and decreased expression of matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor TIMP1. We also discovered markedly increased skin inflammation that appears to be a contributing factor in skin pathology. Histopathologic analyses revealed dysfunctional hair follicles. mtDNA-depleter mice also show changes in expression of aging-associated markers including IGF1R, KLOTHO, VEGF, and MRPS5. mtDNA-repleter mice showed that, by turning off the mutant POLG1 transgene expression, mitochondrial function, as well as the skin and hair pathology, is reversed to wild-type level. To our knowledge that restoration of mitochondrial functions can reverse the skin and hair pathology is unprecedented.</TEXT>

Given this preference, people wishing to be chosen can either increase their own cooperation to become more desirable or suppress others #8217; cooperation to make them less desirable. Previous research shows that very cooperative people sometimes get punished ( #8220;antisocial punishment #8221;) or criticized ( #8220;do-gooder derogation #8221;) in many cultures. Here, we used a public-goods game with punishment to test whether antisocial punishment is used as a means of competing to be chosen by suppressing others #8217; cooperation. As predicted, there was more antisocial punishment when participants were competing to be chosen for a subsequent cooperative task (a trust game) than without a subsequent task. This difference in antisocial punishment cannot be explained by differences in contributions, moralistic punishment, or confusion. This suggests that antisocial punishment is a social strategy that low cooperators use to avoid looking bad when high cooperators escalate cooperation.</TEXT>

Further development of Na-K|K- #946; #8243;-alumina batteries could unlock cost-effective energy storage.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The title of the post is a copy and paste from the title and first paragraph of the linked academic press release here :  gt; Greening Vacant Lots Reduces Feelings of Depression in City Dwellers, Penn Study Finds  gt; Greening vacant urban land significantly reduces feelings of depression and improves overall mental health for the surrounding residents, researchers from the Perelman School of Medicine and the School of Arts  amp; Sciences at the University of Pennsylvania and other institutions show in a new randomized, controlled study published in JAMA Network Open. The findings have implications for cities across the United States, where 15 percent of land is deemed  #8220;vacant #8221; and often blighted or filled with trash and overgrown vegetation. Journal Reference: Eugenia C. South, Bernadette C. Hohl, Michelle C. Kondo, John M. MacDonald, Charles C. Branas. Effect of Greening Vacant Land on Mental Health of Community-Dwelling Adults A Cluster Randomized Trial. JAMA Network Open, 2018 DOI: 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2018.0298 Link: https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2688343 Key Points Question Does the greening of vacant urban land reduce self-reported poor mental health in community-dwelling adults? Findings In this cluster randomized trial of urban greening and mental health, 110 randomly sampled vacant lot clusters were randomly assigned to 3 study groups. Among 342 participants included in the analysis, feeling depressed significantly decreased by 41.5% and self-reported poor mental health showed a reduction of 62.8% for those living near greened vacant lots compared with control participants. Meaning The remediation of vacant and dilapidated physical environments, particularly in resource-limited urban settings, can be an important tool for communities to address mental health problems, alongside other patient-level treatments. Abstract Importance Neighborhood physical conditions have been associated with mental illness and may partially explain persistent socioeconomic disparities in the prevalence of poor mental health. Objective To evaluate whether interventions to green vacant urban land can improve self-reported mental health. Design, Setting, and Participants This citywide cluster randomized trial examined 442 community-dwelling sampled adults living in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, within 110 vacant lot clusters randomly assigned to 3 study groups. Participants were followed up for 18 months preintervention and postintervention. This trial was conducted from October 1, 2011, to November 30, 2014. Data were analyzed from July 1, 2015, to April 16, 2017. Interventions The greening intervention involved removing trash, grading the land, planting new grass and a small number of trees, installing a low wooden perimeter fence, and performing regular monthly maintenance. The trash cleanup intervention involved removal of trash, limited grass mowing where possible, and regular monthly maintenance. The control group received no intervention. Main Outcomes and Measures Self-reported mental health measured by the Kessler-6 Psychological Distress Scale and the components of this scale. Results A total of 110 clusters containing 541 vacant lots were enrolled in the trial and randomly allocated to the following 1 of 3 study groups: the greening intervention (37 clusters [33.6%]), the trash cleanup intervention (36 clusters [32.7%]), or no intervention (37 clusters [33.6%]). Of the 442 participants, the mean (SD) age was 44.6 (15.1) years, 264 (59.7%) were female, and 194 (43.9%) had a family income less than $25 #8239;000. A total of 342 participants (77.4%) had follow-up data and were included in the analysis. Of these, 117 (34.2%) received the greening intervention, 107 (31.3%) the trash cleanup intervention, and 118 (34.5%) no intervention. Intention-to-treat analysis of the greening intervention compared with no intervention demonstrated a significant decrease in participants who were feeling depressed ( #8722;41.5%; 95% CI,  #8722;63.6% to  #8722;5.9%; P #8201;= #8201;.03) and worthless ( #8722;50.9%; 95% CI,  #8722;74.7% to  #8722;4.7%; P #8201;= #8201;.04), as well as a nonsignificant reduction in overall self-reported poor mental health ( #8722;62.8%; 95% CI,  #8722;86.2% to 0.4%; P #8201;= #8201;.051). For participants living in neighborhoods below the poverty line, the greening intervention demonstrated a significant decrease in feeling depressed ( #8722;68.7%; 95% CI,  #8722;86.5% to  #8722;27.5%; P #8201;= #8201;.007). Intention-to-treat analysis of those living near the trash cleanup intervention compared with no intervention showed no significant changes in self-reported poor mental health. Conclusions and Relevance Among community-dwelling adults, self-reported feelings of depression and worthlessness were significantly decreased, and self-reported poor mental health was nonsignificantly reduced for those living near greened vacant land. The treatment of blighted physical environments, particularly in resource-limited urban settings, can be an important treatment for mental health problems alongside other patient-level treatments.</TEXT>

People who are high in guilt-proneness are more likely to be trustworthy than are individuals who are low in guilt-proneness, but they are not universally more generous. We demonstrate that people high in guilt-proneness are more likely to behave in interpersonally sensitive ways when they are more responsible for others #8217; outcomes. We also explore potential interventions to increase trustworthiness. Our findings fill a significant gap in the trust literature by building a foundation for investigating trustworthiness, by identifying a trait predictor of trustworthy intentions and behavior, and by providing practical advice for deciding in whom we should place our trust.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The title of the post is a copy and paste from the title and sixth paragraph of the linked academic press release here :  gt; Lying in a foreign language is easier  gt; Lying is easier in a foreign language: This should be true according to the emotional distance hypothesis. This assumption is based on the fact that lying is associated with more emotions than staying with the truth. Liars have higher stress levels and are more tense. Research from linguistics, psychology, and psychophysiology shows that compared to speaking in a native language, communicating in a second language is less emotionally arousing. "Based on the emotional distance hypothesis, you would hence expect lying in a foreign language to be less arousing emotionally," Suchotzki says. Accordingly, this reduced emotional arousal would facilitate lying. Journal Reference: Kristina Suchotzki, Matthias Gamer. The language of lies: Behavioral and autonomic costs of lying in a native compared to a foreign language. Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, 2018; 147 (5): 734 DOI: 10.1037/xge0000437 Link: http://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fxge0000437 Abstract: Research on trustworthiness indicates that non-native speakers are perceived as less trustworthy than native speakers. Research investigating whether people do indeed lie less well in a non-native language is, however, scarce and yielded inconsistent results. Two opposing predictions are possible. Based on the idea that lying is more demanding than truth telling, the cognitive load account predicts that speaking a foreign language imposes additional cognitive load and thereby hampers lying. Based on the idea that lying is emotionally arousing and that communication in a non-native language is perceived as less emotional, the emotional distance account predicts that speaking a foreign language facilitates lying. In three experiments, participants were asked neutral and emotional questions both in their mother tongue (German) and in a foreign language (English). Depending on a color cue, questions had to be answered sometimes truthfully and sometimes deceptively. Results across all experiments consistently revealed smaller reaction time (RT) differences between lying and truth telling in the foreign compared to the native language condition, which was mostly driven by prolonged truth responses. There were neither differences in this language modulation between emotional and neutral questions nor in autonomic responses. Results could be explained by the antagonistic effects of cognitive load and emotional distance on lying, and suggestions are made how further research may disentangle those effects. Importantly, the observation that foreign language use hampers truth telling could explain the perceived lower trustworthiness of foreign language speakers and education about this effect may help to reduce such a bias.</TEXT>

In the present study, we examined whether the whole-brain LIPUS (low-intensity pulsed ultrasound) therapy is effective and safe in 2 mouse models of dementia (vascular dementia, VaD and Alzheimer's disease, AD), and if so, to elucidate the common underlying mechanism(s) involved. Methods We used bilateral carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) model with micro-coils in male C57BL/6 mice as a VaD model and 5XFAD transgenic mice as an AD model. We applied the LIPUS therapy (1.875 #8239;MHz, 6.0 #8239;kHz, 32cycles) to the whole brain. Results In both models, the LIPUS therapy markedly ameliorated cognitive impairments (Y-maze test and/or passive avoidance test) associated with improved cerebral blood flow (CBF). Mechanistically, the LIPUS therapy significantly increased CD31-positive endothelial cells and Olig2-positive oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) in the VaD model, while it reduced Iba-1-positive microglias and amyloid- #946; (A #946;) plaque in the AD model. In both models, endothelium-related genes were significantly upregulated in RNA-sequencing, and expressions of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and neurotrophins were upregulated in Western blotting. Interestingly, the increases in glia cells and neurotrophin expressions showed significant correlations with eNOS expression. Importantly, these beneficial effects of LIPUS were absent in eNOS-knockout mice. Conclusions These results indicate that the whole-brain LIPUS is an effective and non-invasive therapy for dementia by activating specific cells corresponding to each pathology, for which eNOS activation plays an important role as a common mechanism.</TEXT>

Journal Reference: Hormonal Treatment in Young People With Gender Dysphoria: A Systematic Review Denise Chew, Jemma Anderson, Katrina Williams, Tamara May, Kenneth Pang Pediatrics 2018, 141 (4) e20173742; DOI: 10.1542/peds.2017-3742 Link: http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/141/4/e20173742 Abstract CONTEXT: Hormonal interventions are being increasingly used to treat young people with gender dysphoria, but their effects in this population have not been systematically reviewed before. OBJECTIVE: To review evidence for the physical, psychosocial, and cognitive effects of gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs (GnRHa), gender-affirming hormones, antiandrogens, and progestins on transgender adolescents. DATA SOURCES: We searched Medline, Embase, and PubMed databases from January 1, 1946, to June 10, 2017. STUDY SELECTION: We selected primary studies in which researchers examined the hormonal treatment of transgender adolescents and assessed their psychosocial, cognitive, and/or physical effects. DATA EXTRACTION: Two authors independently screened studies for inclusion and extracted data from eligible articles using a standardized recording form. RESULTS: Thirteen studies met our inclusion criteria, in which researchers examined GnRHas (n = 9), estrogen (n = 3), testosterone (n = 5), antiandrogen (cyproterone acetate) (n = 1), and progestin (lynestrenol) (n = 1). Most treatments successfully achieved their intended physical effects, with GnRHas and cyproterone acetate suppressing sex hormones and estrogen or testosterone causing feminization or masculinization of secondary sex characteristics. GnRHa treatment was associated with improvement across multiple measures of psychological functioning but not gender dysphoria itself, whereas the psychosocial effects of gender-affirming hormones in transgender youth have not yet been adequately assessed. LIMITATIONS: There are few studies in this field and they have all been observational. CONCLUSIONS: Low-quality evidence suggests that hormonal treatments for transgender adolescents can achieve their intended physical effects, but evidence regarding their psychosocial and cognitive impact are generally lacking. Future research to address these knowledge gaps and improve understanding of the long-term effects of these treatments is required.</TEXT>

Journal Reference: Jagsi, R. , Ward, K. C., Abrahamse, P. H., Wallner, L. P., Kurian, A. W., Hamilton, A. S., Katz, S. J. and Hawley, S. T.

Cancer. 2018 doi:10.1002/cncr.31532 Link: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cncr.31532 Abstract Background Little is known regarding whether growing awareness of the financial toxicity of a cancer diagnosis and its treatment has increased clinician engagement or changed the needs of current patients. Methods The authors surveyed patients with early #8208;stage breast cancer who were identified through population #8208;based sampling from 2 Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) regions and their physicians. The authors described responses from approximately 73% of surgeons (370 surgeons), 61% of medical oncologists (306 medical oncologists), 67% of radiation oncologists (169 radiation oncologists), and 68% of patients (2502 patients). Results Approximately one #8208;half (50.9%) of responding medical oncologists reported that someone in their practice often or always discusses financial burden with patients, as did 15.6% of surgeons and 43.2% of radiation oncologists. Patients indicated that financial toxicity remains common: 21.5% of white patients and 22.5% of Asian patients had to cut down spending on food, as did 45.2% of black and 35.8% of Latina patients. Many patients desired to talk to providers about the financial impact of cancer (15.2% of whites, 31.1% of blacks, 30.3% of Latinas, and 25.4% of Asians). Unmet patient needs for engagement with physicians about financial concerns were common. Of 945 women who worried about finances, 679 (72.8%) indicated that physicians and their staff did not help. Of 523 women who desired to talk to providers regarding the impact of breast cancer on employment or finances, 283 (55.4%) reported no relevant discussion. Conclusions Many patients report inadequate clinician engagement in the management of financial toxicity, even though many providers believe that they make services available. Clinician assessment and communication regarding financial toxicity must improve; cure at the cost of financial ruin is unacceptable.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Journal reference: Roll-to-Roll Nanoforming of Metals Using Laser-Induced Superplasticity Debkalpa Goswami , Juan C. Munera, Aniket Pal, Behnam Sadri, Caio Lui P. G. Scarpetti, Ramses V. Martinez ACS Nano Letters 2018 Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA doi: 10.1021/acs.nanolett.8b00714 Link: https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.nanolett.8b00714 Abstract: This Letter describes a low-cost, scalable nanomanufacturing process that enables the continuous forming of thin metallic layers with nanoscale accuracy using roll-to-roll, laser-induced superplasticity (R2RLIS). R2RLIS uses a laser shock to induce the ultrahigh-strain-rate deformation of metallic films at room temperature into low-cost polymeric nanomolds, independently of the original grain size of the metal. This simple and inexpensive nanoforming method does not require access to cleanrooms and associated facilities, and can be easily implemented on conventional CO2 lasers, enabling laser systems commonly used for rapid prototyping or industrial cutting and engraving to fabricate uniform and three-dimensional crystalline metallic nanostructures over large areas. Tuning the laser power during the R2RLIS process enables the control of the aspect ratio and the mechanical and optical properties of the fabricated nanostructures. This roll-to-roll technique successfully fabricates mechanically strengthened gold plasmonic nanostructures with aspect ratios as high as 5 that exhibit high oxidation resistance and strong optical field enhancements. The CO2 laser used in R2RLIS can also integrate the fabricated nanostructures on transparent flexible substrates with robust interfacial contact. The ability to fabricate ultrasmooth metallic nanostructures using roll-to-roll manufacturing enables the large scale production, at a relatively low-cost, of flexible plasmonic devices toward emerging applications.</TEXT>

Crawford Astrobiology 2018 Published Online:23 Jul 2018 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1089/ast.2018.1844 Link: https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/ast.2018.1844 About Our moon is uninhabitable and lifeless today. It has no significant atmosphere, no liquid water on its surface, no magnetosphere to protect its surface from solar wind and cosmic radiation, no polymeric chemistry, and it is subject to large diurnal temperature variations (e.g., Vaniman et al.,1991; Schulze-Makuch and Irwin, 2008). Thus, associating our Moon with habitability seems outrageous, and certainly it would have been just a decade ago. However, results from recent space missions, as well as sensitive analyses of lunar rock and soil samples, have indicated that the Moon is not as dry as previously thought (e.g., Anand, 2010; Hauri et al.,2017). In addition to the probable occurrence of water ice in permanently shadowed polar craters (e.g., Feldman et al.,1998; Baker et al., 2005; Lawrence, 2017), spectroscopic studies also indicate the presence of hydrated surface materials at high, but not permanently shadowed, latitudes (Clark, 2009; Pieters et al.,2009; Li and Milliken, 2017), with evidence for temporal variations over the course of a lunar day (Sunshine et al.,2009). In addition, recent studies of the products of lunar volcanism indicate that the lunar interior also contains more water than was once appreciated and that the lunar mantle may even be as comparably water-rich as Earth's upper mantle (see Hauri et al., 2017, for a review).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The title of the post is a copy and paste from the subtitle of the linked academic press release here :  gt; The creation of artificial embryos has moved a step forward after an international team of researchers used mouse stem cells to produce artificial embryo-like structures capable of  #8216;gastrulation #8217;, a key step in the life of any embryo. Journal Reference: Berna Sozen, Gianluca Amadei, Andy Cox, Ran Wang, Ellen Na, Sylwia Czukiewska, Lia Chappell, Thierry Voet, Geert Michel, Naihe Jing, David M. Glover, Magdalena Zernicka-Goetz. Self-assembly of embryonic and two extra-embryonic stem cell types into gastrulating embryo-like structures. Nature Cell Biology, 2018; DOI: 10.1038/s41556-018-0147-7 Link: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-018-0147-7 Abstract Embryonic stem cells can be incorporated into the developing embryo and its germ line, but, when cultured alone, their ability to generate embryonic structures is restricted. They can interact with trophoblast stem cells to generate structures that break symmetry and specify mesoderm, but their development is limited as the epithelial #8211;mesenchymal transition of gastrulation cannot occur. Here, we describe a system that allows assembly of mouse embryonic, trophoblast and extra-embryonic endoderm stem cells into structures that acquire the embryo #8217;s architecture with all distinct embryonic and extra-embryonic compartments.

    <TEXT>The title of the post is a copy and paste from the subtitle of the linked academic press release here :  gt; The creation of artificial embryos has moved a step forward after an international team of researchers used mouse stem cells to produce artificial embryo-like structures capable of  #8216;gastrulation #8217;, a key step in the life of any embryo. Journal Reference: Berna Sozen, Gianluca Amadei, Andy Cox, Ran Wang, Ellen Na, Sylwia Czukiewska, Lia Chappell, Thierry Voet, Geert Michel, Naihe Jing, David M. Glover, Magdalena Zernicka-Goetz. Self-assembly of embryonic and two extra-embryonic stem cell types into gastrulating embryo-like structures. Nature Cell Biology, 2018; DOI: 10.1038/s41556-018-0147-7 Link: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-018-0147-7 Abstract Embryonic stem cells can be incorporated into the developing embryo and its germ line, but, when cultured alone, their ability to generate embryonic structures is restricted. They can interact with trophoblast stem cells to generate structures that break symmetry and specify mesoderm, but their development is limited as the epithelial #8211;mesenchymal transition of gastrulation cannot occur. Here, we describe a system that allows assembly of mouse embryonic, trophoblast and extra-embryonic endoderm stem cells into structures that acquire the embryo #8217;s architecture with all distinct embryonic and extra-embryonic compartments. Strikingly, such embryo-like structures develop to undertake the epithelial #8211;mesenchymal transition, leading to mesoderm and then definitive endoderm specification. Spatial transcriptomic analyses demonstrate that these morphological transformations are underpinned by gene expression patterns characteristic of gastrulating embryos. This demonstrates the remarkable ability of three stem cell types to self-assemble in vitro into gastrulating embryo-like structures undertaking spatio-temporal events of the gastrulating mammalian embryo.</TEXT>

Here we use a representational similarity analysis approach to show that conceptual knowledge predicts the representational structure of facial emotion perception. We conducted three studies using computer mouse-tracking5 and reverse-correlation6 paradigms. Overall, we found that when individuals believed two emotions to be conceptually more similar, faces from those categories were perceived with a corresponding similarity, even when controlling for any physical similarity in the stimuli themselves. When emotions were rated conceptually more similar, computer-mouse trajectories during emotion perception exhibited a greater simultaneous attraction to both category responses (despite only one emotion being depicted; studies 1 and 2), and reverse-correlated face prototypes exhibited a greater visual resemblance (study 3). Together, our findings suggest that differences in conceptual knowledge are reflected in the perceptual processing of facial emotion.</TEXT>

Journal Reference: Audience Costs and the Dynamics of War and Peace Crisman-Cox, Casey and Gibilisco, Michael (2018) Audience Costs and the Dynamics of War and Peace. American Journal of Political Science, 62 (3). pp. 566-580. ISSN 0092-5853. DOI: https://doi.org/10.1111/ajps.12347 Link: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ajps.12347 Abstract We estimate audience costs and examine their substantive effects on the evolution of interstate disputes by using an infinitely repeated and dynamic game of crisis escalation. Unlike past efforts, our approach estimates country-specific audience cost parameters without replying on proxy variables, e.g., democracy measures. Contrary to intuition, increases in a country's audience costs encourage it to initiate disputes in equilibrium, because the costs serve as a commitment device during the subsequent crisis, incentivizing the country to stand firm and coercing its opponent to back down. Nonetheless, the results demonstrate that larger audience costs would result in more peace worldwide, as they also discourage potential opponents from initiating disputes. Beyond regime type, we find that a free press, provisions for executive appointment or removal, and historical rivalries are also important determinants of audience costs.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Journal Reference: Nicholas Ketz, Aaron Jones, Natalie Bryant, Vincent P. Clark, Praveen K. Pilly. Closed-loop slow-wave tACS improves sleep dependent long-term memory generalization by modulating endogenous oscillations. The Journal of Neuroscience, 2018; 0273-18 DOI: 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0273-18.2018 Link: http://www.jneurosci.org/content/early/2018/07/23/JNEUROSCI.0273-18.2018 Abstract Benefits in long-term memory retention and generalization have been shown to be related to sleep-dependent processes, which correlate with neural oscillations as measured by changes in electric potential. The specificity and causal role of these oscillations, however, are still poorly understood. Here, we investigated the potential for augmenting endogenous Slow-Wave (SW) oscillations in humans with closed-loop transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) with an aim towards enhancing the consolidation of recent experiences into long-term memory. Sixteen (three female) participants were trained pre-sleep on a Target Detection task identifying targets hidden in complex visual scenes. During post-training sleep closed-loop SW detection and stimulation was used to deliver tACS matching the phase and frequency of the dominant oscillation in the range of 0.5 to 1.2 Hz. Changes in performance were assessed the following day using test images that were identical to the training ( #8216;Repeated'), and images generated from training scenes but with novel viewpoints ( #8216;Generalized'). Results showed that active SW tACS during sleep enhanced the post vs. pre-sleep target detection accuracy for the Generalized images compared to sham nights, while no significant change was found for Repeated images. Using a frequency agnostic clustering approach sensitive to stimulation-induced spectral power changes in scalp EEG, this behavioral enhancement significantly correlated with both a post-stimulation increase and subsequent decrease in measured spectral power within the SW band, which in turn showed increased coupling with spindle amplitude. These results suggest that augmenting endogenous SW oscillations can enhance consolidation by specifically improving generalization over recognition or cued recall. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT This human study demonstrates the use of a closed-loop noninvasive brain stimulation method to enhance endogenous neural oscillations during sleep with the effect of improving consolidation of recent experiences into long-term memory. Here we show that transient slow oscillatory transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation (tACS) triggered by endogenous slow oscillations and matching their frequency and phase can increase slow-wave power and coupling with spindles. Further this increase correlates with over night improvements in generalization of recent training to facilitate performance in a target detection task. We also provide novel evidence for a tACS induced refractory period following the tACS induced increase. Here slow-wave power is temporarily reduced relative to sham stimulation, which nonetheless maintains a positive relationship with behavioral improvements.</TEXT>

About 81% of U.S. adults believe marijuana has at least 1 benefit, whereas 17% believe it has no benefit. The most common benefit cited was pain management (66%), followed by treatment of diseases, such as epilepsy and multiple sclerosis (48%), and relief from anxiety, stress, and depression (47%). About 91% of U.S. adults believe marijuana has at least 1 risk, whereas 9% believe it has no risks.

Among U.S. adults, 29.2% agree that smoking marijuana prevents health problems. About 18% believe exposure to secondhand marijuana smoke is somewhat or completely safe for adults, whereas 7.6% indicated that it is somewhat or completely safe for children. Of the respondents, 7.3% agree that marijuana use is somewhat or completely safe during pregnancy. About 22.4% of U.S. adults believe that marijuana is not at all addictive.

Objective To measure sleep quality and noise levels in hospital and compare these with the home environment. Design Observational within case-controlled study. Setting Paediatric medical wards at Southampton Children #8217;s Hospital and bedrooms at home. Participants and methods Participants were children aged 3 #8211;16 years and their co-sleeping parents. Sleep quality was measured using actigraphy for a maximum of 5 nights in each setting. Median sound levels at the bedside were monitored overnight in a subgroup in both settings. Main outcome measures Total sleep time, sleep efficiency, median sound levels overnight. Results 40 children and 16 mothers completed actigraphy in both settings. Children had on average 62.9 min, and parents 72.8 min, per night less sleep in hospital than at home. Both children and parents had poorer sleep quality in hospital than at home: mean sleep efficiency 77.0% vs 83.2% for children and 77.1% vs 88.9% for parents, respectively. Median sound levels in hospital measured in 8 children averaged 48.6 dBA compared with 34.7 dBA at home and exceeded World Health Organization recommendations of 30 dB. Conclusions Children and their mothers have poor quality sleep in paediatric wards. This may affect the child #8217;s behaviour, recovery and pain tolerance. Sleep deprivation adds to parental burden and stress. Sound levels are significantly raised in hospital and may contribute to poor sleep. Reduction in the level of noise might lead to an improvement in sleep, affecting the quality of stay of both parent and child.</TEXT>

DOI: https://doi.org/10.1007/s10803-018-3646-2 Link: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10803-018-3646-2 Abstract This study investigated the effects of four behavior-change techniques for caregivers implementing a 15-week literacy intervention with their children with language impairment. Techniques include modeling, encouragement, feedback, and rewards. Random assignment within a factorial experimental design was used to determine which behavior-change technique(s) each of the 128 caregivers would receive. Caregivers #8217; adherence was assessed for frequency and dosage of intervention based on submission of logs and tape recordings. Children #8217;s print knowledge was assessed at pre- and posttest to assess literacy skills. Results showed that children whose caregivers were rewarded 50 cents per session to implement the intervention made significantly greater gains in print knowledge over the treatment period. Further, these effects were fully mediated by effects of the behavior-change technique on caregivers #8217; adherence to the intervention.</TEXT>

However, no study to date has assessed whether these difficulties extend to episodic foresight, a core component of which is the ability to mentally travel into one #8217;s personal future. This is a particularly surprising omission given that episodic memory is considered to be critical to engage episodic foresight. Aims: In the present study, we provide the first test of how episodic foresight is affected in the context of differing levels of cannabis use, and the degree to which performance on a measure of this construct is related to episodic memory. Results: Fifty-seven regular cannabis users (23 recreational, 34 regular) and 57 controls were assessed using an adapted version of the Autobiographical Interview. The results showed that regular-users exhibited greater impairment of episodic foresight and episodic memory than both recreational-users and cannabis-na #239;ve controls. Conclusions: These data therefore show for the first time that cannabis-related disruption of cognitive functioning extends to the capacity for episodic foresight, and they are discussed in relation to their potential implications for functional outcomes in this group.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The post title is a copy and paste from the third to fifth paragraphs of the linked popular press article here :  gt; In a rare study, researchers set out to explore the relationships between cats and dogs that shared the same homes. They found that while cats might rightly feel the more nervous of the species, they appeared to have little trouble in asserting themselves.  gt; The online survey of 748 homeowners from the UK, the US, Australia, Canada and Europe found that more than 80% felt their pets were comfortable with one another, with only 3% declaring that their cats and dogs could not stand one another.  gt; But despite the general picture of harmony, the survey revealed cats were by far the more antagonistic of the animals. Homeowners reported that cats were three times more likely to threaten their canine housemates than vice versa, and 10 times more likely to injure them in a fight. Not that the dogs seemed unduly concerned: more than a fifth reportedly picked up toys to show them to cats, compared with only 6% of cats doing the same for dogs. Journal Reference: Evaluation of the Relationship Between Cats and Dogs Living in the Same Home Jessica E. Thomson, Sophie S. HallcorrespondenceEmail the author Sophie S. Hall, Daniel S. Mills Journal of Veterinary Behavior 2018 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jveb.2018.06.043 Link: https://www.journalvetbehavior.com/#/article/S1558-7878(17)30239-3/fulltext Abstract: The number of cats and dogs kept together in many parts of the industrialised world is increasing, but we know little about the typical interactions that occur between these two species when they live within the same home. Despite social differences, when conditions are correct, both species are capable of expressing amicability to one another. Although the age at which the two species are introduced to each other is thought to be important, there is little understanding of the range of factors that influence the success of cat-dog relationships. Using an online survey of mixed species homes (n=748), we assessed owners #8217; perceptions of their cat-dog relationship. The majority of owners believed that their cat and dog were comfortable in each other #8217;s presence and showed amicability in their relationship. Typically, the cat appeared to be the main controller in determining amicability in the cat-dog relationship. Regression analysis revealed that owners #8217; perceptions of amicability were more influenced by  #8216;cat factors #8217; than  #8216;dog factors #8217;, with variables such as the age the cat was introduced to the dog (younger age predicted greater perceived amicability), the cat sharing food with the dog and picking up a toy to show the dog (although the latter was observed by few owners) included in the final model. Additionally, comfortability of the cat was a stronger predictor of amicability than comfortability of the dog; frequency of the cat appearing uncomfortable with the dog was a better predictor than the dog appearing uncomfortable in the presence of the cat. These results highlight the need to attend to the cat #8217;s behaviour in particular, along with age of introduction, to promote positive cat-dog relationships.

    <TEXT>Research article: Appetitive information seeking behaviour reveals robust daily rhythmicity for Internet-based food-related keyword searches Nicolas Scrutton Alvarado, Tyler J. Stevenson R. Soc. open sci. 2018 5 172080; DOI: 10.1098/rsos.172080. Published 25 July 2018 Link: http://rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/5/7/172080 Abstract There has been an exponential growth of information seeking behaviour (ISB) via Internet-based programs over the past decade. The availability of software that record ISB temporal patterns has provided a valuable opportunity to examine biological rhythms in human behaviour. Internet search repositories, such as Google Trends, permit the analyses of large datasets that can be used to track ISB on a domestic and international scale. We examined daily and seasonal Google Trends search patterns for keywords related to food intake, using the most relevant search terms for the USA, UK, Canada, India and Australia. Daily and seasonal ISB rhythmicity were analysed using CircWave v. 1.4. Daily ISB data revealed a robust and significant sine waveform for general terms (e.g.  #8216;pizza delivery') and country-specific search terms (e.g.  #8216;just eat'). The pattern revealed clear evening double-peaks, occurring every day at 19.00 and 02.00. The patterns were consistent across search terms, days of the week and geographical locations, suggesting a common ISB rhythm that is not necessarily culture-dependent. Then, we conducted Cosinor v. 2.4 analyses to examine the daily amplitudes in ISB. The results indicated a non-significant linear increased from Monday to Sunday. Seasonal data did not show consistent significant ISB patterns. It is likely that two different human populations are responsible for the daily  #8216;early' and  #8216;late' evening ISB peaks. We propose that the major factor that contributes to the bimodal evening peak is age-dependent (e.g. adolescent, early adulthood versus midlife and mature adulthood) and a minor role for human chronotypes (e.g. late versus early). Overall, we present novel human appetitive behaviour for information seeking of food resources and propose that Internet-based search patterns reflect a biological rhythm of motivation for energy balance.</TEXT>

In particular, they were more likely to be focusing on management and entrepreneurship than other business-related areas.  gt; The study also found that professionals attending business events were almost twice as likely to have started their own business if they were T. gondii positive, and that countries with a higher prevalence of T. gondii infection show more entrepreneurial activity.  gt; The team behind the study say their data suggests that the parasite may be involved in reducing a person #8217;s fear of failure and high-risk, high-reward ventures. Rodents infected with T. gondii are known to become less fearful of encountering cats. Journal Reference: Risky business: linking Toxoplasma gondii infection and entrepreneurship behaviours across individuals and countries Stefanie K. Johnson, Markus A. Fitza, Daniel A. Lerner, Dana M. Calhoun, Marissa A. Beldon, Elsa T. Chan, Pieter T. J. Johnson Proc. R. Soc. B 2018 285 20180822; DOI: 10.1098/rspb.2018.0822. Published 25 July 2018 Link: http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/285/1883/20180822 Abstract Disciplines such as business and economics often rely on the assumption of rationality when explaining complex human behaviours. However, growing evidence suggests that behaviour may concurrently be influenced by infectious microorganisms. The protozoan Toxoplasma gondii infects an estimated 2 billion people worldwide and has been linked to behavioural alterations in humans and other vertebrates. Here we integrate primary data from college students and business professionals with national-level information on cultural attitudes towards business to test the hypothesis that T. gondii infection influences individual- as well as societal-scale entrepreneurship activities. Using a saliva-based assay, we found that students (n = 1495) who tested IgG positive for T. gondii exposure were 1.4 #215; more likely to major in business and 1.7 #215; more likely to have an emphasis in  #8216;management and entrepreneurship' over other business-related emphases. Among professionals attending entrepreneurship events, T. gondii-positive individuals were 1.8 #215; more likely to have started their own business compared with other attendees (n = 197). Finally, after synthesizing and combining country-level databases on T. gondii infection from the past 25 years with the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor of entrepreneurial activity, we found that infection prevalence was a consistent, positive predictor of entrepreneurial activity and intentions at the national scale, regardless of whether previously identified economic covariates were included. Nations with higher infection also had a lower fraction of respondents citing  #8216;fear of failure' in inhibiting new business ventures. While correlational, these results highlight the linkage between parasitic infection and complex human behaviours, including those relevant to business, entrepreneurship and economic productivity.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The title of the post is a copy and paste from the title and second paragraph of the linked academic press release here :  gt; Does receiving favours and freebies make you uncomfortable? Maybe you have  #8220;reciprocity anxiety #8221;  gt; According to a team of researchers led by Xiling Xiong at Zhejiang University in China, my wife and I were suffering from an acute bout of reciprocation anxiety. In their new paper in the Journal of Economic Psychology, Xiong and his colleagues propose that this is not just a state, but a trait  #8211; a specific kind of social anxiety  #8211; that some of us are more prone to than others, and what #8217;s more, they #8217;ve created a new questionnaire to measure it. Journal Reference: Xiling Xiong, Siyuan Guo, Li Gu, Rong Huang, Xinyue Zhou, Reciprocity anxiety: Individual differences in feeling discomfort in reciprocity situations, Journal of Economic Psychology, Volume 67, 2018, Pages 149-161, ISSN 0167-4870, DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joep.2018.05.007. Link: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167487017304877 Abstract: Providing gifts, assistance, or favors to benefit consumers may pressure the recipients to adhere to the norm of reciprocity, which has the potential to increase customer patronage and satisfaction. However, these practices can fail to yield desired results if customers feel uncomfortable about receiving things that need to be reciprocated. People differ in the degree to which they feel anxious in a situation that requires them to reciprocate or when they anticipate such a situation. This research introduces the construct of reciprocity anxiety to capture this individual difference and distinguish it from other variables. We develop an 11-item scale to measure two components of reciprocity anxiety and find that reciprocity anxiety can predict (1) consumers' avoidance behavior toward businesses that may obligate them to reciprocate; (2) consumers' eagerness to repay a benefit provided by businesses; as well as (3) consumers #8217; intentions to make future visits to businesses that employ reciprocity relationship-building tactics.</TEXT>

Link: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195666317310279 Abstract: A growing evidence base confirms sociocultural theory's predictions regarding the influence of direct exposure to family factors (e.g., parental commentary) in promoting disordered eating behavior as mediated by negative body image. Nevertheless, this model has not been specifically applied to investigating indirect or vicarious exposure to family communications (e.g., negative body talk) in estimating mindful eating behavior via positive body image intervening variables. Therefore, to address this gap the present study provided a preliminary evaluation of the indirect effects of overhearing family fat talk through both body appreciation and functional body appreciation in predicting mindful eating among undergraduate females. Participants included 333 women attending a large southeastern public university who completed measures of mindful eating, family fat talk, body appreciation, and functional body appreciation via an online survey platform. Results indicated that family fat talk was inversely associated with mindful eating, body appreciation, and functional body appreciation. Whereas engaging in mindful eating positively corresponded with both positive body image indices. A regression model controlling for BMI also revealed that an orientation towards appreciating what the body can do (and not a general appreciation of the body) helped explain the inverse association between family fat talk and mindful eating. Our initial findings tentatively suggest that focusing on the self-objectifying and self-denigrating body-related commentary of family members may disrupt attention to one's own appreciation of the (internal) workings of the body thereby undermining the mindful eating process. Implications for further expanding the translation of sociocultural theory in the context of positive body image and mindful eating are considered.</TEXT>

Scores of adherence to these recommendations can be calculated at the individual level. Here, we investigated the associations between four nutritional scores and overall, breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer risk in a large prospective population-based cohort: the cancer-specific World Cancer Research Fund/American Institute for Cancer Research (WCRF/AICR) score, the Alternate Healthy Eating Index 2010 (AHEI-2010), a score based on adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MEDI-LITE), and the French National Nutrition Health Program-Guideline Score (PNNS-GS). This study included 41,543 participants aged  #8805;40 years from the NutriNet-Sant #233; cohort (2009 #8211;2017). A total of 1,489 overall incident cancers were diagnosed. A one-point increment of the WCRF/AICR score was significantly associated with decreased overall [12%; 95% confidence interval (CI), 8% #8211;16%; P  lt; 0.0001], breast (14%; 95% CI, 6% #8211;21%; P = 0.001), and prostate (12%; 95% CI, 0% #8211;22%; P = 0.05) cancer risks. Hazard ratio for colorectal cancer risk was 0.86 (95% CI, 0.72 #8211;1.03; P = 0.09). The PNNS-GS score was associated with reduced colorectal cancer risk (P = 0.04) and AHEI-2010 was associated with reduced overall cancer risk (P = 0.03). The WCRF/AICR score performed best. Compared with other tested scores, it included a stronger penalty for alcohol, which is a major risk factor for several cancer sites. Better adherence to nutritional recommendations, especially those designed for cancer prevention, could substantially contribute to decreased cancer incidence. Significance: This large prospective population-based cohort study suggests that following dietary recommendations such as the ones proposed by the World Cancer Research Fund/American Institute for Cancer Research could significantly contribute to cancer prevention.

Unlike other tissues, the parenchyma of the central nervous system (CNS) lacks lymphatic vasculature and waste products are removed partly through a paravascular route. (Re)discovery and characterization of meningeal lymphatic vessels has prompted an assessment of their role in waste clearance from the CNS. Here we show that meningeal lymphatic vessels drain macromolecules from the CNS (cerebrospinal and interstitial fluids) into the cervical lymph nodes in mice. Impairment of meningeal lymphatic function slows paravascular influx of macromolecules into the brain and efflux of macromolecules from the interstitial fluid, and induces cognitive impairment in mice. Treatment of aged mice with vascular endothelial growth factor C enhances meningeal lymphatic drainage of macromolecules from the cerebrospinal fluid, improving brain perfusion and learning and memory performance. Disruption of meningeal lymphatic vessels in transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer #8217;s disease promotes amyloid- #946; deposition in the meninges, which resembles human meningeal pathology, and aggravates parenchymal amyloid- #946; accumulation. Meningeal lymphatic dysfunction may be an aggravating factor in Alzheimer #8217;s disease pathology and in age-associated cognitive decline. Thus, augmentation of meningeal lymphatic function might be a promising therapeutic target for preventing or delaying age-associated neurological diseases.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The title of the post is a copy and paste from the subtitle and fifth paragraph of the linked academic press release here :  gt; Analysis shows that US counties with a history of lynching events have higher contemporary mortality rates for whites and Blacks  gt; Their final analysis statistically adjusted for factors that could affect mortality, such as the percent of county residents with health insurance, education levels, local unemployment rates, and similar considerations. With these factors accounted for, the researchers concluded that living in a county with the strongest history of lynching, versus no such history, was associated with higher mortality rates. Journal Reference: Probst, J.C. et al (2018). Strange Harvest: a Cross-sectional Ecological Analysis of the population ratio Between Historic Lynching Events and 2010-2014 County Mortality Rates, Journal of Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities DOI: 10.1007/s40615-018-0509-7 Link: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs40615-018-0509-7 Abstract Background While the causes of lynching, a violent expression of racism, have been explored, little research has addressed the long-term consequences of this phenomenon. We examined the associaton between living in a county with a history of lynching and contemporary mortality rates within Southern US states. Methods County-level data for lynchings between 1877 and 1950 were available for 1221 counties. Lynching rates were standardized to the 1930 population. Age-adjusted mortality rates were aggregated over 2010 #8211;2014 to allow sufficient observations in small counties. Multivariable linear regression examined the association between lynching rate categories and mortality while holding other county characteristics constant. Results Overall age-adjusted mortality ranged from 863 deaths per 100,000 persons in counties with no recorded lynchings to 910 in the highest lynching rate counties (p #8201; lt; #8201;0.000). In adjusted models, living in the highest versus lowest lynching category was associated with 34.9 (95% confidence interval 13.3 #8211;56.7) additional deaths per 100,000 per year for white males, 23.7 (95% CI 7.48 #8211;40.0) deaths for white females, and 31.0 (95% CI 3.6 #8211;58.4) deaths for African American females. No association was found for African American male death rates (31.3; 95% CI  #8722; #8201;13.6 to 76.1). Discussion The mechanisms through which historic lynching events might be associated with contemporary mortality rates are not clear. We advocate further research into structural characteristics of counties that may influence such disparities.</TEXT>

Prior studies have shown that the successful use of IM relates to a number of important outcomes for employees (e.g., higher performance evaluations), but this work has tended to compare IM usage between individuals, ignoring the fact that employees likely adjust their use of IM depending on the situations they face at work on a given day. In this paper, we argue that managing impressions on a daily basis can be draining, thereby leaving employees susceptible to the temptation to engage in subsequent harmful behaviors at work. To better understand the nature and within-person consequences of IM, we examine the daily use of two supervisor-focused IM tactics #8212;ingratiation and self-promotion #8212;among 75 professionals in China over the course of two work weeks. Our results indicate that there is significant within-person variance in employees #8217; use of ingratiation and self-promotion aimed at supervisors. Moreover, our findings suggest that the use of ingratiation, but not self-promotion, depletes employees #8217; self-control resources. In the case of ingratiation, this depletion is positively associated with employee deviance, and the indirect effect is stronger among employees with low political skill. Overall, this research contributes to our understanding of the dynamic, within-person nature of IM, the consequences of IM for employees, and the dark side of IM for organizations.</TEXT>

To better understand the nature and within-person consequences of IM, we examine the daily use of two supervisor-focused IM tactics #8212;ingratiation and self-promotion #8212;among 75 professionals in China over the course of two work weeks. Our results indicate that there is significant within-person variance in employees #8217; use of ingratiation and self-promotion aimed at supervisors. Moreover, our findings suggest that the use of ingratiation, but not self-promotion, depletes employees #8217; self-control resources. In the case of ingratiation, this depletion is positively associated with employee deviance, and the indirect effect is stronger among employees with low political skill. Overall, this research contributes to our understanding of the dynamic, within-person nature of IM, the consequences of IM for employees, and the dark side of IM for organizations.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The title of the post is a copy and paste from the title and first paragraph of the linked academic press release here :  gt; Mobile Phone Radiation may Affect Memory Performance in Adolescents  gt; Radiofrequency electromagnetic fields may have adverse effects on the development of memory performance of specific brain regions exposed during mobile phone use. These are the findings of a study involving nearly 700 adolescents in Switzerland. Journal References: Foerster M., Thielens A., Joseph W., Eeftens M., R #246; #246;sli M. A prospective cohort study of adolescents' memory performance and individual brain dose of microwave radiation from wireless communication. Environmental Health Perspectives, 2018 DOI: 10.1289/EHP2427 Link: https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/EHP2427/ Abstract BACKGROUND: The potential impact of microwave radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMF) emitted by wireless communication devices on neurocognitive functions of adolescents is controversial. In a previous analysis, we found changes in figural memory scores associated with a higher cumulative RF-EMF brain dose in adolescents. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to follow-up our previous results using a new study population, dose estimation, and approach to controlling for confounding from media usage itself. METHODS: RF-EMF brain dose for each participant was modeled. Multivariable linear regression models were fitted on verbal and figural memory score changes over 1 y and on estimated cumulative brain dose and RF-EMF related and unrelated media usage (n=669 #8211;676). Because of the hemispheric lateralization of memory, we conducted a laterality analysis for phone call ear preference. To control for the confounding of media use behaviors, a stratified analysis for different media usage groups was also conducted. RESULTS: We found decreased figural memory scores in association with an interquartile range (IQR) increase in estimated cumulative RF-EMF brain dose scores:  #8722;0.22 (95% CI:  #8722;0.47, 0.03; IQR: 953 #8201;mJ/kg #8201;per #8201;day) in the whole sample,  #8722;0.39 (95% CI:  #8722;0.67,  #8722;0.10; IQR: 953 #8201;mJ/kg #8201;per #8201;day) in right-side users (n=532), and  #8722;0.26 (95% CI:  #8722;0.42,  #8722;0.10; IQR: 341 #8201;mJ/kg #8201;per #8201;day) when recorded network operator data were used for RF-EMF dose estimation (n=274). Media usage unrelated to RF-EMF did not show significant associations or consistent patterns, with the exception of consistent (nonsignificant) positive associations between data traffic duration and verbal memory. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings for a cohort of Swiss adolescents require confirmation in other populations but suggest a potential adverse effect of RF-EMF brain dose on cognitive functions that involve brain regions mostly exposed during mobile phone use.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The title of the post is a copy and paste from the title and first paragraph of the linked academic press release here :  gt; People who feel faint, dizzy or lightheaded when standing up may be experiencing a sudden drop in blood pressure called orthostatic hypotension. Now a new study says middle-aged people who experience such a drop may have a greater risk of developing dementia or stroke decades later. The study is published in the July 25, 2018, online issue of Neurology #174; , the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology. Journal Reference: Andreea M. Rawlings, Stephen P. Juraschek, Gerardo Heiss, Timothy Hughes, Michelle L. Meyer, Elizabeth Selvin, A. Richey Sharrett, B. Gwen Windham, Rebecca F. Gottesman. Association of orthostatic hypotension with incident dementia, stroke, and cognitive decline. Neurology, 2018; 10.1212/WNL.0000000000006027 DOI: 10.1212/WNL.0000000000006027 Link: http://n.neurology.org/content/early/2018/07/25/WNL.0000000000006027 Abstract Objective To examine associations of orthostatic hypotension (OH) with dementia and long-term cognitive decline and to update previously published results in the same cohort for stroke with an additional 16 years of follow-up. Methods We analyzed data from 11,709 participants without a history of coronary heart disease or stroke who attended the baseline examination (1987 #8211;1989) of the prospective Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study. OH was defined as a drop in systolic blood pressure (BP) of at least 20 mm Hg or a drop in diastolic BP of at least 10 mm Hg on standing. Dementia was ascertained via examination, contact with participants or their proxy, or medical record surveillance. Ischemic stroke was ascertained via cohort surveillance of hospitalizations, cohort follow-up, and linkage with registries. Both outcomes were adjudicated. Cognitive function was ascertained via 3 neuropsychological tests administered in 1990 to 1992 and 1996 to 1998 and a full battery of tests in 2011 to 2013. Scores were summarized and reported as SDs. We used adjusted Cox regression and linear mixed models. Results Over  #8776;25 years, 1,068 participants developed dementia and 842 had an ischemic stroke. Compared to persons without OH at baseline, those with OH had a higher risk of dementia (hazard ratio [HR] 1.54, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.20 #8211;1.97) and ischemic stroke (HR 2.08, 95% CI 1.65 #8211;2.62). Persons with OH had greater, although nonsignificant, cognitive decline over 20 years (SD 0.09, 95% CI  #8722;0.02 to 0.21). Conclusions OH assessed in midlife was independently associated with incident dementia and ischemic stroke. Additional studies are needed to elucidate potential mechanisms for these associations and possible applications for prevention.</TEXT>

Journal Reference: Neurocognitive, Autonomic, and Mood Effects of Adderall: A Pilot Study of Healthy College Students Lisa L. Weyandt 1,* , Tara L. White 2,3,4, Bergljot Gyda Gudmundsdottir 5, Adam Z. Nitenson 6, Emma S. Rathkey 7, Kelvin A. De Leon 6 and Stephanie A. Bjorn Pharmacy 2018, 6(3), 58; DOI: https://doi.org/10.3390/pharmacy6030058 Link: http://www.mdpi.com/2226-4787/6/3/58 Abstract Prescription stimulant medications are considered a safe and long-term effective treatment for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Studies support that stimulants enhance attention, memory, self-regulation and executive function in individuals with ADHD. Recent research, however, has found that many college students without ADHD report misusing prescription stimulants, primarily to enhance their cognitive abilities. This practice raises the question whether stimulants actually enhance cognitive functioning in college students without ADHD. We investigated the effects of mixed-salts amphetamine (i.e., Adderall, 30 mg) on cognitive, autonomic and emotional functioning in a pilot sample of healthy college students without ADHD (n = 13), using a double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subjects design. The present study was the first to explore cognitive effects in conjunction with mood, autonomic effects, and self-perceptions of cognitive enhancement. Results revealed that Adderall had minimal, but mixed, effects on cognitive processes relevant to neurocognitive enhancement (small effects), and substantial effects on autonomic responses, subjective drug experiences, and positive states of activated emotion (large effects). Overall, the present findings indicate dissociation between the effects of Adderall on activation and neurocognition, and more importantly, contrary to common belief, Adderall had little impact on neurocognitive performance in healthy college students. Given the pilot design of the study and small sample size these findings should be interpreted cautiously. The results have implications for future studies and the education of healthy college students and adults who commonly use Adderall to enhance neurocognition.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The title of the post is a copy and paste from the title and second paragraph of the linked popular press release here :  gt; Illicit use of ADHD meds won't boost grades: Study  gt; But a new study shows that drugs like Adderall do not improve, and can actually impair, brain function in healthy students who take the drug hoping for an intelligence boost. Journal Reference: Neurocognitive, Autonomic, and Mood Effects of Adderall: A Pilot Study of Healthy College Students Lisa L. Weyandt 1,* , Tara L. White 2,3,4, Bergljot Gyda Gudmundsdottir 5, Adam Z. Nitenson 6, Emma S. Rathkey 7, Kelvin A. De Leon 6 and Stephanie A. Bjorn Pharmacy 2018, 6(3), 58; DOI: https://doi.org/10.3390/pharmacy6030058 Link: http://www.mdpi.com/2226-4787/6/3/58 Abstract Prescription stimulant medications are considered a safe and long-term effective treatment for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Studies support that stimulants enhance attention, memory, self-regulation and executive function in individuals with ADHD. Recent research, however, has found that many college students without ADHD report misusing prescription stimulants, primarily to enhance their cognitive abilities. This practice raises the question whether stimulants actually enhance cognitive functioning in college students without ADHD. We investigated the effects of mixed-salts amphetamine (i.e., Adderall, 30 mg) on cognitive, autonomic and emotional functioning in a pilot sample of healthy college students without ADHD (n = 13), using a double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subjects design. The present study was the first to explore cognitive effects in conjunction with mood, autonomic effects, and self-perceptions of cognitive enhancement.

But it can cause meal-time tension and damage the parent-child relationship, a new study suggests. Journal Reference: Julie C. Lumeng, Alison L.

Link: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195666317308784 Abstract: Several common theoretical frameworks have posited causal pathways between picky eating, pressuring feeding, and growth in early childhood. The evidence to support these pathways is limited. This observational cohort study sought to examine the cross-lagged associations between mother-reported pressuring feeding, mother-reported child picky eating, and measured weight-for-length z-score (WLZ) across child ages 21, 27, and 33 months (n #8239;= #8239;244). Cross-lagged analysis was used to evaluate longitudinal associations between these three constructs. The sample was 50.5% white, 52.3% male and 37.8% of mothers had a high school education or less. Mean WLZ was 0.52, 0.41, and 0.38 #8239;at each age, respectively. Pressuring feeding, picky eating, and WLZ each tracked strongly from 21 to 33 months. There were concurrent associations between pressuring feeding and picky eating. However, there were no prospective associations between pressuring feeding and future WLZ; WLZ and future pressuring feeding; pressuring feeding and future picky eating; picky eating and future pressuring feeding; or picky eating and future WLZ. Our results do not support causal relationships between picky eating, pressuring feeding, and growth in toddlerhood. Future work that examines alternative mechanisms shaping growth in early childhood is needed.</TEXT>

To test whether contact sports and CTE are associated with LBD, we compared deceased contact sports athletes (n #8201;= #8201;269) to cohorts from the community (n #8201;= #8201;164) and the Boston University Alzheimer disease (AD) Center (n #8201;= #8201;261).

Traditional and hierarchical clustering showed a similar pattern of LBD distribution in CTE compared to LBD alone that was most frequently neocortical, limbic, or brainstem. In the community-based cohort, years of contact sports play were associated with neocortical LBD (OR = 1.30 per year, p #8201;= #8201;0.012), and in a pooled analysis a threshold of  gt;8 #8201;years of play best predicted neocortical LBD (ROC analysis, OR = 6.24, 95% CI = 1.5 #8211;25, p #8201;= #8201;0.011), adjusting for age, sex, and APOE  #603;4 allele status. Clinically, dementia was significantly associated with neocortical LBD, CTE stage, and AD; parkinsonism was associated with LBD pathology but not CTE stage. Contact sports participation may increase risk of developing neocortical LBD, and increased LBD frequency may partially explain extrapyramidal motor symptoms sometimes observed in CTE.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The title of the post is a copy and paste from the first paragraph of the linked academic press release here :  gt; New research indicates that the absent-minded use of smartphones  #8212; rather than the general use of a smartphone per se  #8212; is linked to mind-wandering and a lack of attention. Journal Reference: Marty-Dugas, J., Ralph, B. C. W., Oakman, J. M.,  amp; Smilek, D. (2018). The relation between smartphone use and everyday inattention. Psychology of Consciousness: Theory, Research, and Practice, 5(1), 46-62. DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/cns0000131 Link: http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-40489-001 Abstract In 2 studies, we explored the relation between subjective reports of smartphone use and everyday inattention. We created 2 questionnaires that measured general smartphone use (e.g., how frequently people send and receive text messages, use social media, etc.), and absent-minded smartphone use (e.g., how frequently people use their phone without a purpose in mind). To measure everyday inattention, participants completed 4 scales that assessed everyday attention lapses, attention-related errors, spontaneous mind-wandering, and deliberate mind-wandering, respectively. The results of both studies revealed a strong positive relation between general and absent-minded smartphone use. Furthermore, we observed significant positive correlations between each of the smartphone use questionnaires and each of the 4 measures of inattention. However, a series of regression analyses demonstrated that when both types of smartphone use were considered simultaneously, the relation between inattention and smartphone use was driven entirely by absent-minded use. Specifically, absent-minded smartphone use consistently had a unique positive relation with the inattention measures, while general smartphone use either had no relation (Study 1) or a unique negative relation (Study 2) with inattention. Personal anecdote: My Reddit use is  #8220;purposeful #8221; so I #8217;m hopefully ok. ;)</TEXT>

Journal Reference: Tarek S. Awad, Dalal Asker, Benjamin D. Hatton. Food-Safe Modification of Stainless Steel Food-Processing Surfaces to Reduce Bacterial Biofilms. ACS Applied Materials  amp; Interfaces, 2018; 10 (27): 22902 DOI: 10.1021/acsami.8b03788 Link: https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsami.8b03788 Abstract: Biofilm formation on stainless steel (SS) surfaces of food-processing plants, leading to food-borne illness outbreaks, is enabled by the attachment and confinement of pathogens within microscale cavities of surface roughness (grooves, scratches). We report foodsafe oil-based slippery coatings (FOSCs) for food-processing surfaces that suppress bacterial adherence and biofilm formation by trapping residual oil lubricant within these surface cavities to block microbial growth. SS surfaces were chemically functionalized with alkylphosphonic acid to preferentially wet a layer of food-grade oil. FOSCs reduced the effective surface roughness, the adhesion of organic food residue, and bacteria. FOSCs significantly reduced Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm formation on standard roughness SS-316 by 5 log CFU cm #8211;2, and by 3 log CFU cm #8211;2 for mirror-finished SS. FOSCs also enhanced surface cleanability, which we measured by bacterial counts after conventional detergent cleaning. Importantly, both SS grades maintained their antibiofilm activity after the erosion of the oil layer by surface wear with glass beads, which suggests that there is a residual volume of oil that remains to block surface cavity defects. These results indicate the potential of such low-cost, scalable approaches to enhance the cleanability of SS food-processing surfaces and improve food safety by reducing biofilm growth.

However, even if they tried to adjust the amount of study time to account for the distraction, they are unlikely to adjust enough, because people #8217;s perception of time is also disrupted when there is distraction.

DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/xge0000449 Link: http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2018-32180-002 Abstract Memory tasks involve a degree of judgment and strategic decision-making, based upon the perceived benefits of particular learning, maintenance and recall strategies. The consequences of these metacognitive judgments for memory have been amply documented under experimental conditions that require participants to focus upon a task in the absence of distractors. Eight experiments consider the impact of less benign environmental conditions #8212;specifically, the presence of distracting speech #8212;upon the metacognitive aspects of memory. Distraction reliably disrupted free recall and, as indicated by judgments of learning, participants were aware of this effect. However, because participants did not adjust study time in compensation, the distraction effect was exaggerated relative to experimenter-imposed presentation rates. This finding appears to be the consequence of distraction-induced disruption of time perception at encoding, rather than any deliberate strategy. The results highlight the need to consider the impact of more challenging environments on metacognition generally. Personal anecdote: I personally block out noisy distraction if I want to study by listening to music, usually classical, sometimes jazz, occasionally electronica - the key for me is no vocals.</TEXT>

Objective: To understand the public's views on the risks and benefits of marijuana use. Design: Probability-based online survey. Setting: United States, 2017. Participants: 16 280 U.S. adults. Measurements: Proportion of U.S. adults who agreed with a statement. Results: The response rate was 55.3% (n = 9003). Approximately 14.6% of U.S. adults reported using marijuana in the past year. About 81% of U.S. adults believe marijuana has at least 1 benefit, whereas 17% believe it has no benefit. The most common benefit cited was pain management (66%), followed by treatment of diseases, such as epilepsy and multiple sclerosis (48%), and relief from anxiety, stress, and depression (47%). About 91% of U.S. adults believe marijuana has at least 1 risk, whereas 9% believe it has no risks. The most common risk identified by the public was legal problems (51.8%), followed by addiction (50%) and impaired memory (42%). Among U.S. adults, 29.2% agree that smoking marijuana prevents health problems. About 18% believe exposure to secondhand marijuana smoke is somewhat or completely safe for adults, whereas 7.6% indicated that it is somewhat or completely safe for children. Of the respondents, 7.3% agree that marijuana use is somewhat or completely safe during pregnancy. About 22.4% of U.S. adults believe that marijuana is not at all addictive.

In addition to generating oxygen, fixing carbon, and recycling waste and water, plants could play a critical role in producing food and biomass feedstock for the microbial manufacture of materials, chemicals, and medicines in long-term interplanetary outposts. However, because life on Earth evolved under the conditions of the terrestrial biosphere, plants will not perform optimally in different planetary habitats. The construction or transportation of plant growth facilities and the availability of resources, such as sunlight and liquid water, may also be limiting factors, and would thus impose additional challenges to efficient farming in an extraterrestrial destination. Using the framework of the forthcoming human missions to Mars, here we discuss a series of bioengineering endeavors that will enable us to take full advantage of plants in the context of a Martian greenhouse. We also propose a roadmap for research on adapting life to Mars and outline our opinion that synthetic biology efforts towards this goal will contribute to solving some of the main agricultural and industrial challenges here on Earth.</TEXT>

Using the framework of the forthcoming human missions to Mars, here we discuss a series of bioengineering endeavors that will enable us to take full advantage of plants in the context of a Martian greenhouse. We also propose a roadmap for research on adapting life to Mars and outline our opinion that synthetic biology efforts towards this goal will contribute to solving some of the main agricultural and industrial challenges here on Earth.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The title of the post is a copy and paste from the sixth paragraph of the linked academic press release here :  gt; However, on the line-ups, the cannabis intoxicated participants performed just as accurately as the sober participants, both at correctly identifying the suspect if he was present, or correctly noting his absence if he wasn #8217;t there. What #8217;s more, the intoxicated participants were more confident in their judgments, and there was a stronger correlation between their confidence and accuracy. The researchers surmised this greater insight could be due to the known effect of cannabis on increasing introspection and internal focus. Journal Reference: Effects of cannabis on eyewitness memory: A field study Annelies Vredeveldt Steve D. Charman Aukje den Blanken Maren Hooydonk Applied Cognitive Psychology Volume 32, Issue 4 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1002/acp.3414 Link: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/acp.3414 Summary Eyewitnesses to crimes are regularly under the influence of drugs, such as cannabis. Yet there is very little research on how the use of cannabis affects eyewitness memory. In the present study, we assessed the effects of cannabis on eyewitness recall and lineup identification performance in a field setting. One hundred twenty visitors of coffee shops in Amsterdam viewed a videotaped criminal event, were interviewed about the event, and viewed a target #8208;present or target #8208;absent lineup. Witnesses under the influence of cannabis remembered significantly fewer correct details about the witnessed event than did sober witnesses, with no difference in incorrect recall. Cannabis use was not significantly associated with lineup identification performance, but intoxicated witnesses were significantly better at judging whether their lineup identification was accurate. Theoretical and practical implications of the findings are discussed.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The title of the post is a copy and paste from the second and tenth paragraphs of the linked academic press release here :  gt; A large study examining media reporting of suicide found significant associations between reporting details and suicide deaths, underscoring the need for responsible reporting.  gt; Several elements were associated with increased suicides, such as describing the method -- especially in the headline -- describing suicide as inevitable and reporting on suicide in celebrities. Journal Reference: The association between suicide deaths and putatively harmful and protective factors in media reports Mark Sinyor, Ayal Schaffer, Yasunori Nishikawa, Donald A. Redelmeier, Thomas Niederkrotenthaler, Jitender Sareen, Anthony J. Levitt, Alex Kiss and Jane Pirkis CMAJ July 30, 2018 190 (30) E900-E907; DOI: https://doi.org/10.1503/cmaj.170698 Link: http://www.cmaj.ca/content/190/30/E900 Abstract BACKGROUND: Exposure to media reporting on suicide can lead to suicide contagion and, in some circumstances, may also lead to help-seeking behaviour. There is limited evidence for which specific characteristics of media reports mediate these phenomena. METHODS: This observational study examined associations between putatively harmful and protective elements of media reports about suicide in 13 major publications in the Toronto media market and subsequent suicide deaths in Toronto (2011 #8211;2014). We used multivariable logistic regression to determine whether specific article characteristics were associated with increases or decreases in suicide deaths in the 7 days after publication, compared with a control window. RESULTS: From 2011 to 2014, there were 6367 articles with suicide as the major focus and 947 suicide deaths. Elements most strongly and independently associated with increased suicides were a statement about the inevitability of suicide (odds ratio [OR] 1.97, confidence interval [CI] 1.07 #8211;3.62), about asphyxia by a method other than car exhaust (OR 1.72, CI 1.36 #8211;2.18), about suicide by jumping from a building (OR 1.70, CI 1.28 #8211;2.26) or about suicide pacts (OR 1.63, CI 1.14 #8211;2.35), or a headline that included the suicide method (OR 1.41, CI 1.07 #8211;1.86). Elements most strongly and independently associated with decreased suicides were unfavourable characteristics (negative judgments about the deceased; OR 1.85, CI 1.20 #8211;2.84), or mentions of railway (OR 1.61, CI 1.10 #8211;2.36) and cutting or stabbing (OR 1.59, CI 1.19 #8211;2.13) deaths, and individual murder-suicide (OR 1.50, CI 1.23 #8211;1.84). INTERPRETATION: This large study identified significant associations between several specific elements of media reports and suicide deaths. It suggests that reporting on suicide can have a meaningful impact on suicide deaths and that journalists and media outlets and organizations should carefully consider the specific content of reports before publication.</TEXT>

Objective To determine whether the etiologies and presentations of anaphylaxis has changed over the last decade in our population. Methods Patient charts were identified based upon ICD-9 codes for anaphylactic shock. Charts identified were analyzed for clinical symptoms reported, comorbidities, etiology, investigative testing, and subsequent treatment. These cases were categorized as definitive, probable, or idiopathic based on history and results from testing, similar to our prior reports. Results We identified 281 possible cases, of which 218 met criteria for anaphylaxis. Among the cases, median age was 42 years (range 9-78) and 64% were female. In the review of cases, 85 (39%) were determined to have a definitive etiology, 57 a probable etiology (26%), and 76 (35%) were idiopathic. Interestingly, among those with a definitive cause, the most common etiology identified was galactose-alpha-1,3-galactose ( #945;- gal), accounting for 28 cases (33%). Foods were the 2nd leading cause accounting for 24 cases (28%). Conclusion In this follow up report on anaphylaxis etiology from a single center, the most common etiology was  #945;-gal. This varies greatly from the prior reports our center. Interestingly, the percent of cases attributed to idiopathic anaphylaxis decreased from 59% in our past report to 35% in this report, which could largely be explained by the number of  #945;-gal cases.</TEXT>

Nature Human Behaviour, 2018; DOI: 10.1038/s41562-018-0394-4 Link: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-018-0394-4 Abstract Definitions of our species as unique within the hominin clade have tended to focus on differences in capacities for symbolism, language, social networking, technological competence and cognitive development. More recently, however, attention has been turned towards humans #8217; unique ecological plasticity. Here, we critically review the growing archaeological and palaeoenvironmental datasets relating to the Middle #8211;Late Pleistocene (300 #8211;12 thousand years ago) dispersal of our species within and beyond Africa. We argue, based on comparison with the available information for other members of the genus Homo, that our species developed a new ecological niche, that of the  #8216;generalist specialist #8217;. Not only did it occupy and utilize a diversity of environments, but it also specialized in its adaptation to some of these environmental extremes. Understanding this ecological niche provides a framework for discussing what it means to be human and how our species became the last surviving hominin on the planet.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The post title is a copy and paste from the title and sixth paragraph of the linked academic press release here:  gt; Political and business leaders who change their moral stance are perceived not as brave, but hypocritical and ineffective  gt; The results suggest that abandoning a moral position will almost certainly cost you. Journal reference: Kreps, T. A., Laurin, K.,  amp; Merritt, A. C. (2017). Hypocritical flip-flop, or courageous evolution? When leaders change their moral minds. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 113(5), 730-752. DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/pspi0000103 Link: http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-25112-001 Abstract How do audiences react to leaders who change their opinion after taking moral stances? We propose that people believe moral stances are stronger commitments, compared with pragmatic stances; we therefore explore whether and when audiences believe those commitments can be broken. We find that audiences believe moral commitments should not be broken, and thus that they deride as hypocritical leaders who claim a moral commitment and later change their views. Moreover, they view them as less effective and less worthy of support. Although participants found a moral mind changer especially hypocritical when they disagreed with the new view, the effect persisted even among participants who fully endorsed the new view. We draw these conclusions from analyses and meta-analyses of 15 studies (total N = 5,552), using recent statistical advances to verify the robustness of our findings. In several of our studies, we also test for various possible moderators of these effects; overall we find only 1 promising finding: some evidence that 2 specific justifications for moral mind changes #8212;citing a personally transformative experience, or blaming external circumstances rather than acknowledging opinion change #8212;help moral leaders appear more courageous, but no less hypocritical. Together, our findings demonstrate a lay belief that moral views should be stable over time; they also suggest a downside for leaders in using moral framings.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Journal Reference: Bradford J. Foley, Andrew J. Smye. Carbon Cycling and Habitability of Earth-Sized Stagnant Lid Planets. Astrobiology, 2018; 18 (7): 873 DOI: 10.1089/ast.2017.1695 Link: https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/ast.2017.1695 Abstract Models of thermal evolution, crustal production, and CO2 cycling are used to constrain the prospects for habitability of rocky planets, with Earth-like size and composition, in the stagnant lid regime. Specifically, we determine the conditions under which such planets can maintain rates of CO2 degassing large enough to prevent global surface glaciation but small enough so as not to exceed the upper limit on weathering rates provided by the supply of fresh rock, a situation which would lead to runaway atmospheric CO2 accumulation and an inhospitably hot climate. The models show that stagnant lid planets with initial radiogenic heating rates of 100 #8211;250 TW, and with total CO2 budgets ranging from  #8764;10 #8722;2 to 1 times Earth's estimated CO2 budget, can maintain volcanic outgassing rates suitable for habitability for  #8776;1 #8211;5 Gyr; larger CO2 budgets result in uninhabitably hot climates, while smaller budgets result in global glaciation. High radiogenic heat production rates favor habitability by sustaining volcanism and CO2 outgassing longer. Thus, the results suggest that plate tectonics may not be required for establishing a long-term carbon cycle and maintaining a stable, habitable climate. The model is necessarily highly simplified, as the uncertainties with exoplanet thermal evolution and outgassing are large. Nevertheless, the results provide some first-order guidance for future exoplanet missions, by predicting the age at which habitability becomes unlikely for a stagnant lid planet as a function of initial radiogenic heat budget. This prediction is powerful because both planet heat budget and age can potentially be constrained from stellar observations.</TEXT>

Journal Reference: Noa Zitron-Emanuel, Tzvi Ganel, Food deprivation reduces the susceptibility to size-contrast illusions, Appetite, Volume 128, 2018, Pages 138-144, ISSN 0195-6663, DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2018.06.006. Link: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195666318300011 Abstract: Hunger, caused by mild amount of food deprivation, is an everyday physiological state familiar to us all. Ongoing research has pinpointed the way hunger affects people's physiological functions as well as their attitudes and allocation of attention toward domain-specific, food-related objects. Yet, little is known about the way food deprivation affects basic perceptual abilities. Here, we utilized size-contrast visual illusions commonly associated with food to explore the way deprivation affects relative processing of food size. In two experiments (Nexp1 #8239;= #8239;32 females, mean age: 24.31; Nexpt2 #8239;= #8239;41 females, 40 males, mean age: 23.84), we examined the effect food deprivation has on participants #8217; susceptibility to the Delboeuf illusion, which biases the perceived size of a neutral or of a food-related object when it is placed within the context of another object (e.g., a pizza is perceived as smaller when placed on a larger plate or tray). The results showed that food deprivation reduces the illusory bias for food-related but not for neutral stimuli. Such reduction in the illusory effect indicates reliance on analytic, rather than on relative processing style, for domain-specific stimuli when in the state of hunger.</TEXT>

Link: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195666318300011 Abstract: Hunger, caused by mild amount of food deprivation, is an everyday physiological state familiar to us all. Ongoing research has pinpointed the way hunger affects people's physiological functions as well as their attitudes and allocation of attention toward domain-specific, food-related objects. Yet, little is known about the way food deprivation affects basic perceptual abilities. Here, we utilized size-contrast visual illusions commonly associated with food to explore the way deprivation affects relative processing of food size. In two experiments (Nexp1 #8239;= #8239;32 females, mean age: 24.31; Nexpt2 #8239;= #8239;41 females, 40 males, mean age: 23.84), we examined the effect food deprivation has on participants #8217; susceptibility to the Delboeuf illusion, which biases the perceived size of a neutral or of a food-related object when it is placed within the context of another object (e.g., a pizza is perceived as smaller when placed on a larger plate or tray). The results showed that food deprivation reduces the illusory bias for food-related but not for neutral stimuli. Such reduction in the illusory effect indicates reliance on analytic, rather than on relative processing style, for domain-specific stimuli when in the state of hunger.</TEXT>

As the five years survival rate remains around 5%, the identification of novel pharmacological targets and development of new therapeutic strategies are urgently needed. Here we demonstrate that inhibition of the G protein-coupled receptor GPR55, using genetic and pharmacological approaches, reduces pancreatic cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo and we propose that this may represent a novel strategy to inhibit pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) progression. Specifically, we show that genetic ablation of Gpr55 in the KRASWT/G12D/TP53WT/R172H/Pdx1-Cre+/+ (KPC) mouse model of PDAC significantly prolonged survival. Importantly, KPC mice treated with a combination of the GPR55 antagonist Cannabidiol (CBD) and gemcitabine (GEM, one of the most used drugs to treat PDAC), survived nearly three times longer compared to mice treated with vehicle or GEM alone. Mechanistically, knockdown or pharmacologic inhibition of GPR55 reduced anchorage-dependent and independent growth, cell cycle progression, activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling and protein levels of ribonucleotide reductases in PDAC cells. Consistent with this, genetic ablation of Gpr55 reduced proliferation of tumour cells, MAPK signalling and ribonucleotide reductase M1 levels in KPC mice. Combination of CBD and GEM inhibited tumour cell proliferation in KPC mice and it opposed mechanisms involved in development of resistance to GEM in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we demonstrate that the tumour suppressor p53 regulates GPR55 protein expression through modulation of the microRNA miR34b-3p. Our results demonstrate the important role played by GPR55 downstream of p53 in PDAC progression. Moreover our data indicate that combination of CBD and GEM, both currently approved for medical use, might be tested in clinical trials as a novel promising treatment to improve PDAC patients #8217; outcome.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The post title is a copy and paste from the title and twelfth paragraphs of the linked academic press release here:  gt; Changing your thought patterns is key to overcoming insomnia, according to new psychology research  gt;  #8220;In essence, it appears that learning how to worry less about sleep is helpful in people with insomnia  #8212; and that this may be achieved through either cognitive therapy or mindfulness-based therapy. #8221; Journal reference: Effective Insomnia Treatments: Investigation of Processes in Mindfulness and Cognitive Therapy Christopher William Lee (a1), Melissa J. Ree (a2) and Mei Yin Wong (a3) Behaviour Change, Volume 35, Issue 2 June 2018 , pp. 71-90 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1017/bec.2018.10 Link: https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/behaviour-change/article/effective-insomnia-treatments-investigation-of-processes-in-mindfulness-and-cognitive-therapy/0AF5C54E2DDAED377EF31581701806FE Abstract Understanding the underlying mechanisms of recovery from insomnia is an important goal for improving existing treatments. In a randomised controlled trial, 57 participants with insomnia disorder were given either cognitive therapy (CT) or mindfulness-based therapy (MBT) following 4 sessions of CBT. Each participant was assessed on process measures related to CT and MBT. MBT resulted in improvement on mindfulness process measures and the size of the improvement was significantly greater than achieved in the CT condition. Interestingly, CT and MBT both resulted in significant improvement on the cognitive process measures. Treatment outcome on the primary outcome measure (Insomnia Severity Index) was not predicted by type of treatment but was predicted by posttreatment scores on the cognitive process measures. The results suggest that changes in cognitive processes are especially important in treating insomnia, and that there are different therapeutic modalities through which this can be achieved.</TEXT>

Journal Reference: How Gender Identity and Transgender Status Affect Perceptions of Attractiveness Jessica M. Mao, M. L. Haupert, Eliot R. Smith Social Psychological and Personality Science 2018 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1177/1948550618783716 Link: http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1948550618783716 Abstract Can a perceiver #8217;s belief about a target #8217;s transgender status (distinct from gender nonconforming appearance) affect perceptions of the target #8217;s attractiveness? Cisgender, heterosexual men and women (N = 319) received randomly assigned labels (cisgender cross-gender, transgender man, transgender woman, or nonbinary) paired with 48 cross-sex targets represented by photos and rated the attractiveness and related characteristics of those targets. The gender identity labels had a strong, pervasive effect on ratings of attraction. Nonbinary and especially transgender targets were perceived as less attractive than cisgender targets. The effect was particularly strong for male perceivers, and for women with traditional gender attitudes. Sexual and romantic attraction are not driven solely by sexed appearance; information about gender identity and transgender status also influences these assessments. These results have important implications for theoretical models of sexual orientation and for the dating lives of transgender people.</TEXT>

Journal Reference: Darling, Get Closer to Me: Spatial Proximity Amplifies Interpersonal Liking Show all authors Ji-eun Shin, Eunkook M. Suh, Norman P. Li, Kangyong Eo, Sang Chul Chong, Ming-Hong Tsai Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin 2018 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1177/0146167218784903 Link: http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0146167218784903 Abstract Does close distance increase liking for a social object? In a preliminary sociogram task, an association between proximity and intimacy was found in drawings of self and others. In three experimental studies, male participants consistently preferred female targets who were (actually or appeared to be) close than far from them. Distance was manipulated through various means #8212;sitting distance (Study 2), presenting two facial images separately to each eye by a stereoscopic device (Study 3), or a video clip (Study 4). This effect was stronger among those with deprived social needs and occurred in part because close (vs. far) targets seemed psychologically more accessible to the perceiver. Our findings offer rare experimental evidence for the empirically challenged propinquity effect and provide new insights on how distance shapes inner experience.</TEXT>

Associations of Tipped and Untipped Service Work with Poor Mental Health in a Nationally Representative Cohort of Adolescents Followed into Adulthood. American Journal of Epidemiology, 2018; DOI: 10.1093/aje/kwy123 Link: https://academic.oup.com/aje/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/aje/kwy123/5035689 Abstract Precarious work is concentrated in the service industry in the United States and is a risk factor for poor mental health. Service occupations in which workers receive tips are potentially more precarious due to unstable schedule and income, and lack of benefits. We tested hypotheses that individuals working in tipped service occupations have greater odds of experiencing poor mental health (as indicated by self-reported depression, sleep problems, and/or greater perceived stress) relative to individuals in untipped service and nonservice occupations, using cross-sectional data from wave IV of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health data set (2007 #8211;2008; age range, 24 #8211;33 years). To improve comparability of occupation types, propensity scores were computed as a function of childhood factors, then used to construct a sample of 2,815 women and 2,586 men. In gender-stratified multivariable regression, women in tipped service had greater odds of reporting a depression diagnosis or symptoms relative to women in nonservice work (odds ratio = 1.61; 95% confidence interval: 1.11, 2.34). Associations of similar magnitude for sleep problems and perceived stress were observed among women but were not statistically significant; all associations were close to the null among men. Additional research is necessary to understand the factors that underlie differences in poor mental health in tipped and untipped service versus nonservice workers.</TEXT>

G.,  amp; Bless, H. (2018). Beautiful mess effect: Self #8211;other differences in evaluation of showing vulnerability. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 115(2), 192-205. DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/pspa0000120 Link: http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2018-34832-002 Abstract Confessing romantic feelings, asking for help, or taking responsibility for a mistake constitute just a few examples of situations that require showing one #8217;s vulnerability. Out of fear, many individuals decide against it. To explore whether these fears are reflected in the evaluation of others, we investigate self #8211;other differences in evaluation of showing vulnerability. Drawing on construal level theory, we hypothesize that the mental representations of individuals who find themselves in a vulnerable situation are rather concrete, shifting the focus on the negative aspects of making oneself vulnerable and resulting in a relatively negative evaluation of showing vulnerability. By contrast, when depicting others in a vulnerable situation, individuals are expected to represent it more abstractly, focus more on the positive aspects of showing vulnerability, and, therefore, evaluate it more positively. A total of seven studies demonstrate the predicted self #8211;other differences in the evaluation of showing vulnerability in various situations, such as confessing love, revealing imperfections of one #8217;s body, or asking for help, including evidence on the generalizability of the effect in a real-life situation. Moreover, we report empirical evidence on the crucial role of level of construal in the emergence of the observed self-other differences.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The title of the post is a copy and paste from the title and seventh paragraph of the linked academic press release here :  gt; Bioengineered Lungs Grown in a Lab Successfully Transplanted Into Living Pigs  gt; Within two weeks, the transplanted lungs had already begun to establish the robust networks of blood vessels they need to survive. Journal Reference: Production and transplantation of bioengineered lung into a large-animal model Joan E. Nichols1,*, Saverio La Francesca2, Jean A. Niles1, Stephanie P. Vega3, Lissenya B. Argueta4, Luba Frank5, David C. Christiani6,7, Richard B. Pyles8, Blanca E.

Nichols et al. tackled the challenges of vascular perfusion, recellularization, and engraftment of tissue-engineered lungs in a clinically relevant pig model. Nanoparticle and hydrogel delivery of growth factors promoted cell adhesion to whole decellularized pig lung scaffolds. Autologous cell #8211;seeded bioengineered lungs showed vascular perfusion via collateral circulation within 2 weeks after transplantation. The transplanted bioengineered lungs became aerated and developed native lung-like microbiomes. One pig had no respiratory symptoms when euthanized a full 2 months after transplant. This work represents a considerable advance in the lung tissue engineering field and brings tissue-engineered lungs closer to the realm of clinical possibility. Abstract The inability to produce perfusable microvasculature networks capable of supporting tissue survival and of withstanding physiological pressures without leakage is a fundamental problem facing the field of tissue engineering. Microvasculature is critically important for production of bioengineered lung (BEL), which requires systemic circulation to support tissue survival and coordination of circulatory and respiratory systems to ensure proper gas exchange. To advance our understanding of vascularization after bioengineered organ transplantation, we produced and transplanted BEL without creation of a pulmonary artery anastomosis in a porcine model. A single pneumonectomy, performed 1 month before BEL implantation, provided the source of autologous cells used to bioengineer the organ on an acellular lung scaffold. During 30 days of bioreactor culture, we facilitated systemic vessel development using growth factor #8211;loaded microparticles. We evaluated recipient survival, autograft (BEL) vascular and parenchymal tissue development, graft rejection, and microbiome reestablishment in autografted animals 10 hours, 2 weeks, 1 month, and 2 months after transplant. BEL became well vascularized as early as 2 weeks after transplant, and formation of alveolar tissue was observed in all animals (n = 4). There was no indication of transplant rejection. BEL continued to develop after transplant and did not require addition of exogenous growth factors to drive cell proliferation or lung and vascular tissue development. The sterile BEL was seeded and colonized by the bacterial community of the native lung.</TEXT>

Journal Reference: Vanessa Saalfeld, Zeina Ramadan, Vaughan Bell, Nichola J. Raihani. Experimentally induced social threat increases paranoid thinking. Royal Society Open Science, 2018; 5 (8): 180569 DOI: 10.1098/rsos.180569 Link: http://rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/5/8/180569 Abstract The ability to attribute intentions to others is a hallmark of human social cognition but is altered in paranoia. Paranoia is the most common positive symptom of psychosis but is also present to varying degrees in the general population. Epidemiological models suggest that psychosis risk is associated with low social rank and minority status, but the causal effects of status and group affiliation on paranoid thinking remain unclear. We examined whether relative social status and perceived group affiliation, respectively, affect live paranoid thinking using two large-N (N = 2030), pre-registered experiments. Interacting with someone from a higher social rank or a political out-group led to an increase in paranoid attributions of harmful intent for ambiguous actions. Pre-existing paranoia predicted a general increase in harmful intent attribution, but there was no interaction with either type of social threat: highly paranoid people showed the same magnitude of increase as non-paranoid people, although from a higher baseline. We conclude social threat in the form of low social status and out-group status affects paranoid attributions, but ongoing paranoia represents a lowered threshold for detecting social threat rather than an impaired reactivity to it.</TEXT>

Journal Reference: Constructing  #8220;Experts #8221; Among Peers: Educational Infrastructure, Test Data, and Teachers #8217; Interactions About Teaching James P. Spillane, Matthew Shirrell, Samrachana Adhikari Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis 2018 DOI: https://doi.org/10.3102/0162373718785764 Link: http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3102/0162373718785764 Abstract Teachers #8217; on-the-job interactions with colleagues impact their effectiveness, yet little research has explored whether and how teacher performance predicts these interactions. Drawing on 5 years of social network data from one school district, we explore the relationship between teacher performance and teachers #8217; instructional advice and information interactions. Results demonstrate that higher performing teachers are not more likely to be sought out for advice; instead, higher performing teachers are more likely to seek advice. Although school staff report they can identify the  #8220;best #8221; teachers, they generally do not rely on student test scores, instead relying on more readily accessible indicators of performance. These findings have important implications for policy and practices that seek to promote desired interactions among teachers.</TEXT>

Abstract There is a growing concern that the widespread use of computers, mobile phones and other digital devices before bedtime disrupts our sleep with detrimental effects on our health and cognitive performance.

However, there is little empirical evidence on the causal relationship between technology use near bedtime and sleep. This paper studies the causal effects of access to high-speed Internet on sleep. We first show that playing video games, using PC or smartphones, watching TV or movies are correlated with shorter sleep duration. Second, we exploit historical differences in pre-existing telephone infrastructure that affected the deployment of high-speed Internet across Germany (see Falck et al., 2014) to identify a source of plausibly exogenous variation in access to Broadband. Using this instrumental variable strategy, we find that access to high-speed Internet (DSL) access reduces sleep duration and sleep satisfaction.

BMJ, 2018; k2927 DOI: 10.1136/bmj.k2927 Link: https://www.bmj.com/content/362/bmj.k2927 Abstract Objective To examine the association between alcohol consumption and risk of dementia. Design Prospective cohort study. Setting Civil service departments in London (Whitehall II study). Participants 9087 participants aged 35-55 years at study inception (1985/88). Main outcome measures Incident dementia, identified through linkage to hospital, mental health services, and mortality registers until 2017. Measures of alcohol consumption were the mean from three assessments between 1985/88 and 1991/93 (midlife), categorised as abstinence, 1-14 units/week, and  gt;14 units/week; 17 year trajectories of alcohol consumption based on five assessments of alcohol consumption between 1985/88 and 2002/04; CAGE questionnaire for alcohol dependence assessed in 1991/93; and hospital admission for alcohol related chronic diseases between 1991 and 2017. Results 397 cases of dementia were recorded over a mean follow-up of 23 years. Abstinence in midlife was associated with a higher risk of dementia (hazard ratio 1.47, 95% confidence interval 1.15 to 1.89) compared with consumption of 1-14 units/week. Among those drinking  gt;14 units/week, a 7 unit increase in alcohol consumption was associated with a 17% (95% confidence interval 4% to 32%) increase in risk of dementia. CAGE score  gt;2 (hazard ratio 2.19, 1.29 to 3.71) and alcohol related hospital admission (4.28, 2.72 to 6.73) were also associated with an increased risk of dementia. Alcohol consumption trajectories from midlife to early old age showed long term abstinence (1.74, 1.31 to 2.30), decrease in consumption (1.55, 1.08 to 2.22), and long term consumption  gt;14 units/week (1.40, 1.02 to 1.93) to be associated with a higher risk of dementia compared with long term consumption of 1-14 units/week. Analysis using multistate models suggested that the excess risk of dementia associated with abstinence in midlife was partly explained by cardiometabolic disease over the follow-up as the hazard ratio of dementia in abstainers without cardiometabolic disease was 1.33 (0.88 to 2.02) compared with 1.47 (1.15 to 1.89) in the entire population. Conclusion The risk of dementia was increased in people who abstained from alcohol in midlife or consumed  gt;14 units/week. In several countries, guidelines define thresholds for harmful alcohol consumption much higher than 14 units/week. The present findings encourage the downward revision of such guidelines to promote cognitive health at older ages.</TEXT>

Abstract: Humor is considered a valuable trait when evaluating potential mates, and women demonstrate a preference for men's ability to produce humor. Humor displays as a male mating strategy appear context-dependent, which suggests that women's preferences for certain humor may be contingent on their mating goals. One dimension of humor variability that could approximate men's long- (LTM) or short-term (STM) mating goals is communication of humor that is categorically clean or dirty, respectively, which could influence the humorists' desirability to women. Such displays may differentially signal sexual receptivity. Two studies tasked women with indicating interest in men who generated either clean or dirty humor. Across both studies clean humor producers were preferred when evaluating both the long- and short-term desirability of men, although this preference was larger for LTM evaluations. Study 2 also demonstrated that sociosexually unrestricted women (i.e., those with more permissive sexual attitudes) self-reported greater behavioral attraction toward dirty humorists, a preference mediated by their perceptions of dirty jokes as funnier. Dirty humor production in men and appreciation in women may facilitate respective STM goals.

    <TEXT>The title of the post is a copy and paste from the first and tenth paragraphs of the linked academic press release here :  gt; People do not always share the appreciation they feel for those they care about, but why not? Based on the results of a series of experiments, Amit Kumar and Nicholas Epley of the University of Chicago have concluded that one reason is that we often underestimate the positive consequences of expressing gratitude.  gt; Therefore, while people sending a letter of gratitude are likely preoccupied with finding just the right words to express their feelings (while anxious about coming across as incompetent or awkward), the recipients are often not focused on competence but on warmth and intent of the message that they have received. Journal Reference: Undervaluing Gratitude: Expressers Misunderstand the Consequences of Showing Appreciation Amit Kumar, Nicholas Epley Psychological Science 2018 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1177/0956797618772506 Link: http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797618772506 Abstract Expressing gratitude improves well-being for both expressers and recipients, but we suggest that an egocentric bias may lead expressers to systematically undervalue its positive impact on recipients in a way that could keep people from expressing gratitude more often in everyday life. Participants in three experiments wrote gratitude letters and then predicted how surprised, happy, and awkward recipients would feel. Recipients then reported how receiving an expression of gratitude actually made them feel. Expressers significantly underestimated how surprised recipients would be about why expressers were grateful, overestimated how awkward recipients would feel, and underestimated how positive recipients would feel. Expected awkwardness and mood were both correlated with participants #8217; willingness to express gratitude. Wise decisions are guided by an accurate assessment of the expected value of action. Underestimating the value of prosocial actions, such as expressing gratitude, may keep people from engaging in behavior that would maximize their own #8212;and others #8217; #8212;well-being.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The title of the post is a copy and paste from the title and fourth paragraph of the linked academic press release here :  gt; Eating crickets can be good for your gut, according to new clinical trial  gt; It shows that consuming crickets can help support the growth of beneficial gut bacteria and that eating crickets is not only safe at high doses but may also reduce inflammation in the body. Journal Reference: Valerie J. Stull, Elijah Finer, Rachel S. Bergmans, Hallie P. Febvre, Colin Longhurst, Daniel K. Manter, Jonathan A. Patz, Tiffany L. Weir. Impact of Edible Cricket Consumption on Gut Microbiota in Healthy Adults, a Double-blind, Randomized Crossover Trial. Scientific Reports, 2018; 8 (1) DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-29032-2 Link: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-29032-2 Abstract Edible insects are often considered a nutritious, protein-rich, environmentally sustainable alternative to traditional livestock with growing popularity among North American consumers. While the nutrient composition of several insects is characterized, all potential health impacts have not been evaluated. In addition to high protein levels, crickets contain chitin and other fibers that may influence gut health. In this study, we evaluated the effects of consuming 25 grams/day whole cricket powder on gut microbiota composition, while assessing safety and tolerability. Twenty healthy adults participated in this six-week, double-blind, crossover dietary intervention. Participants were randomized into two study arms and consumed either cricket-containing or control breakfast foods for 14 days, followed by a washout period and assignment to the opposite treatment. Blood and stool samples were collected at baseline and after each treatment period to assess liver function and microbiota changes. Results demonstrate cricket consumption is tolerable and non-toxic at the studied dose. Cricket powder supported growth of the probiotic bacterium, Bifidobacterium animalis, which increased 5.7-fold. Cricket consumption was also associated with reduced plasma TNF- #945;.

Impact of Edible Cricket Consumption on Gut Microbiota in Healthy Adults, a Double-blind, Randomized Crossover Trial.

While the nutrient composition of several insects is characterized, all potential health impacts have not been evaluated. In addition to high protein levels, crickets contain chitin and other fibers that may influence gut health. In this study, we evaluated the effects of consuming 25 grams/day whole cricket powder on gut microbiota composition, while assessing safety and tolerability. Twenty healthy adults participated in this six-week, double-blind, crossover dietary intervention. Participants were randomized into two study arms and consumed either cricket-containing or control breakfast foods for 14 days, followed by a washout period and assignment to the opposite treatment. Blood and stool samples were collected at baseline and after each treatment period to assess liver function and microbiota changes. Results demonstrate cricket consumption is tolerable and non-toxic at the studied dose. Cricket powder supported growth of the probiotic bacterium, Bifidobacterium animalis, which increased 5.7-fold. Cricket consumption was also associated with reduced plasma TNF- #945;.

    <TEXT>The title of the post is a copy and paste from the second and fourth paragraphs of the linked academic press release here :  gt; In the study, which has just been published in the journal Science, they identify and characterize a common decision process that may distinguish followers from leaders: Responsibility aversion, or the unwillingness to make decisions that also affect others.  gt; The scientists tested several common intuitive beliefs, such as the notion that individuals who are less afraid of potential losses or taking risks, or who like being in control, will be more willing to take on responsibility for others. These characteristics, however, did not explain the differing extent of responsibility aversion found in the study participants. Journal Reference: Micah G. Edelson, Rafael Polania, Christian C. Ruff, Ernst Fehr, Todd A. Hare. Computational and neurobiological foundations of leadership decisions. Science, 2018; 361 (6401): eaat0036 DOI: 10.1126/science.aat0036 Link: http://science.sciencemag.org/content/361/6401/eaat0036 Leadership and responsibility Leadership of groups is of paramount importance and pervades almost every aspect of society. Leadership research has rarely used computational modeling or neuroimaging techniques to examine mechanistic or neurobiological underpinnings of leadership choices. Edelson et al. found empirically and theoretically that the choice to lead rests on a metacognitive process (see the Perspective by Fleming and Bang). Individuals who showed less  #8220;responsibility aversion #8221; had higher leadership scores. A computational model combining signal detection theory with prospect theory provided a mechanistic understanding of this preference. Neuroimaging experiments showed how the key theoretical concepts are encoded in the activity and connectivity of a brain network that comprises the medial prefrontal cortex, the superior temporal gyrus, the temporal parietal junction, and the anterior insula. Structured Abstract INTRODUCTION Decisions as diverse as committing soldiers to the battlefield or picking a school for your child share a basic attribute: assuming responsibility for the outcome of others. This responsibility is inherent in the roles of prime ministers and generals, as well as in the more quotidian roles of firm managers, schoolteachers, and parents. Here we identify the underlying behavioral, computational, and neurobiological mechanisms that determine the choice to assume responsibility over others. METHODS We developed a decision paradigm in which an individual can delegate decision-making power about a choice between a risky and a safe option to their group or keep the right to decide: In the  #8220;self #8221; trials, only the individual #8217;s payoff is at stake, whereas in the  #8220;group #8221; trials, each group member #8217;s payoff is affected. We combined models from perceptual and value-based decision-making to es #173;timate each individual #8217;s personal utility for every available action in order to tease apart potential motivations for choosing to  #8220;lead #8221; or  #8220;follow. #8221; We also used brain imaging to examine the neurobiological basis of leadership choices. RESULTS The large majority of the subjects display responsibility aversion (see figure, left panel), that is, their willingness to choose between the risky and the safe option is lower in the group trials relative to the self trials, independent of basic preferences toward risk, losses, ambiguity, social preferences, or intrinsic valuations of decision rights. Furthermore, our findings indicate that responsibility aversion is not associated with the overall frequency of keeping or delegating decision-making power. Rather, responsibility aversion is driven by a second-order cognitive process reflecting an increase in the demand for certainty about what constitutes the best choice when others #8217; welfare is affected. Individuals who are less responsibility averse have higher questionnaire-based and real-life leadership scores. The center panel of the figure shows the correlation between predicted and observed leadership scores in a new, independent sample. Our analyses of the dynamic interactions between brain regions demonstrate the importance of information flow between brain regions involved in computing separate components of the choice to understanding leadership decisions and individual differences in responsibility aversion. DISCUSSION The driving forces behind people #8217;s choices to lead or follow are very important but largely unknown. We identify responsibility aversion as a key determinant of the willingness to lead. Moreover, it is predictive of both survey-based and real-life leadership scores. These results sug #173;gest that many people associate a psychological cost with assuming responsibility for others #8217; outcomes. Individual differences in the perception of, and willingness to bear, responsibility as the price of leadership may determine who will strive toward leadership roles and, moreover, are associated with how well they perform as leaders. Our computational model provides a conceptual framework for the decision to assume responsibility for others #8217; outcomes as well as insights into the cognitive and neural mechanisms driving this choice process. This framework applies to many different leadership types, including authoritarian leaders, who make most decisions themselves, and egalitarian leaders, who frequently seek a group consensus. We believe that such a theoretical foundation is critical for a precise understanding of the nature and consequences of leadership. Abstract Leaders must take responsibility for others and thus affect the well-being of individuals, organizations, and nations. We identify the effects of responsibility on leaders #8217; choices at the behavioral and neurobiological levels and document the widespread existence of responsibility aversion, that is, a reduced willingness to make decisions if the welfare of others is at stake. In mechanistic terms, basic preferences toward risk, loss, and ambiguity do not explain responsibility aversion, which, instead, is driven by a second-order cognitive process reflecting an increased demand for certainty about the best choice when others #8217; welfare is affected. Finally, models estimating levels of information flow between brain regions that process separate choice components provide the first step in understanding the neurobiological basis of individual variability in responsibility aversion and leadership scores.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The post title is a direct copy and paste from the first paragraph of the linked article:  gt; In a recent Nature Sustainability paper, a team of scientists concluded that the Earth can sustain, at most, only seven billion people at subsistence levels of consumption (and this June saw us at 7.6 billion). Achieving "high life satisfaction" for everyone, however, would transgress the Earth's biophysical boundaries, leading to ecological collapse. I note that the linked article does constructively challenge the conclusions of the article I #8217;ve referred to in my post title. For those interested here is the link of the journal reference below, which is full text. Journal reference: A good life for all within planetary boundaries Daniel W. O #8217;Neill, Andrew L.

Using indicators designed to measure a  #8216;safe and just #8217; development space, we quantify the resource use associated with meeting basic human needs, and compare this to downscaled planetary boundaries for over 150 nations. We find that no country meets basic needs for its citizens at a globally sustainable level of resource use. Physical needs such as nutrition, sanitation, access to electricity and the elimination of extreme poverty could likely be met for all people without transgressing planetary boundaries. However, the universal achievement of more qualitative goals (for example, high life satisfaction) would require a level of resource use that is 2 #8211;6 times the sustainable level, based on current relationships. Strategies to improve physical and social provisioning systems, with a focus on sufficiency and equity, have the potential to move nations towards sustainability, but the challenge remains substantial. My basic summary: We can fit up to 7 billion people on earth if we want to give them the basics within current resources (more than that may be problematic). But for a high quality of life for everyone, we would need 2 to 6 times our current resources or we may wreck the planet.</TEXT>

Journal Reference: Benjamin W. Bellet, Payton J. Jones, Richard J. McNally, Trigger warning: Empirical evidence ahead, Journal of Behavior Therapy and Experimental Psychiatry, Volume 61, 2018, Pages 134-141, ISSN 0005-7916, DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbtep.2018.07.002. Link: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0005791618301137 Abstract: Background and objectives Trigger warnings notify people of the distress that written, audiovisual, or other material may evoke, and were initially used to provide for the needs of those with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Since their inception, trigger warnings have become more widely applied throughout contemporary culture, sparking intense controversy in academia and beyond. Some argue that they empower vulnerable individuals by allowing them to psychologically prepare for or avoid disturbing content, whereas others argue that such warnings undermine resilience to stress and increase vulnerability to psychopathology while constraining academic freedom. The objective of our experiment was to investigate the psychological effects of issuing trigger warnings. Methods We randomly assigned online participants to receive (n #8239;= #8239;133) or not receive (n #8239;= #8239;137) trigger warnings prior to reading literary passages that varied in potentially disturbing content. Results Participants in the trigger warning group believed themselves and people in general to be more emotionally vulnerable if they were to experience trauma. Participants receiving warnings reported greater anxiety in response to reading potentially distressing passages, but only if they believed that words can cause harm. Warnings did not affect participants' implicit self-identification as vulnerable, or subsequent anxiety response to less distressing content. Limitations The sample included only non-traumatized participants; the observed effects may differ for a traumatized population. Conclusions Trigger warnings may inadvertently undermine some aspects of emotional resilience. Further research is needed on the generalizability of our findings, especially to collegiate populations and to those with trauma histories.</TEXT>

It is particularly important to quantify patterns for school-age children given their disproportionate role in transmission, but it remains unclear how the structure of such social interactions changes over time. By integrating data collection into a public engagement programme, we examined self-reported contact networks in year 7 groups in four UK secondary schools. We collected data from 460 unique participants across four rounds of data collection conducted between January and June 2015, with 7,315 identifiable contacts reported in total. Although individual-level contacts varied over the study period, we were able to obtain out-of-sample accuracies of more than 90% and F-scores of 0.49 #8211;0.84 when predicting the presence or absence of social contacts between specific individuals across rounds of data collection. Network properties such as clustering and number of communities were broadly consistent within schools between survey rounds, but varied significantly between schools. Networks were assortative according to gender, and to a lesser extent school class, with the estimated clustering coefficient larger among males in all surveyed co-educational schools. Our results demonstrate that it is feasible to collect longitudinal self-reported social contact data from school children and that key properties of these data are consistent between rounds of data collection.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The post title is a direct copy and paste from the first paragraph of the linked article:  gt; In a recent Nature Sustainability paper, a team of scientists concluded that the Earth can sustain, at most, only seven billion people at subsistence levels of consumption (and this June saw us at 7.6 billion). Achieving "high life satisfaction" for everyone, however, would transgress the Earth's biophysical boundaries, leading to ecological collapse. I note that the linked article does constructively challenge the conclusions of the article I #8217;ve referred to in my post title. For those interested here is the link of the journal reference below, which is full text. Journal reference: A good life for all within planetary boundaries Daniel W. O #8217;Neill, Andrew L. Fanning, Julia K. Steinberger Nature Sustainability, volume 1, pages88 #8211;95 (2018) DOI: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41893-018-0021-4 Link: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-018-0021-4 Abstract Humanity faces the challenge of how to achieve a high quality of life for over 7 billion people without destabilizing critical planetary processes. Using indicators designed to measure a  #8216;safe and just #8217; development space, we quantify the resource use associated with meeting basic human needs, and compare this to downscaled planetary boundaries for over 150 nations. We find that no country meets basic needs for its citizens at a globally sustainable level of resource use. Physical needs such as nutrition, sanitation, access to electricity and the elimination of extreme poverty could likely be met for all people without transgressing planetary boundaries. However, the universal achievement of more qualitative goals (for example, high life satisfaction) would require a level of resource use that is 2 #8211;6 times the sustainable level, based on current relationships. Strategies to improve physical and social provisioning systems, with a focus on sufficiency and equity, have the potential to move nations towards sustainability, but the challenge remains substantial. My basic summary: We can fit up to 7 billion people on earth if we want to give them the basics within current resources (more than that may be problematic). But for a high quality of life for everyone, we would need 2 to 6 times our current resources or we may wreck the planet.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The title of the post is a copy and paste from the first, fourth, seventh and eight paragraphs of the linked academic press release here :  gt; Individual differences in the personality trait Openness to Experience are associated with variation in brain structure, according to new neuroimaging research.  gt; Openness to experience #8212;defined as the breadth and depth of a person #8217;s experiential life #8212;is of great interest to creativity researchers because people who score higher on this factor also tend to think and behave more creatively.  gt;  #8220;The key finding from our study was that there was a negative correlation between Openness and cortical thickness in regions of the brain that underlie memory and cognitive control. This is an interesting finding because typically reduced cortical thickness is associated with decreased cognitive function, including lower psychometric measures of intelligence, #8221; Vartanian told PsyPost.  gt;  #8220;We believe that the reason why Openness is associated with reduced cortical thickness is that this condition reduces the person #8217;s ability to filter the contents of thought, thereby facilitating greater immersion in the sensory, cognitive, and emotional information that might otherwise have been filtered out of consciousness. #8221; Journal Reference: Structural correlates of Openness and Intellect: Implications for the contribution of personality to creativity Oshin Vartanian Christopher J. Wertz Ranee A. Flores Erin L. Beatty Human Brain Mapping, Volume 39, Issue 7 Doi: https://doi.org/10.1002/hbm.24054 Link: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hbm.24054 Abstract Openness/Intellect (i.e., openness to experience) is the Big Five personality factor most consistently associated with individual differences in creativity. Recent psychometric evidence has demonstrated that this factor consists of two distinct aspects #8212;Intellect and Openness. Whereas Intellect reflects perceived intelligence and intellectual engagement, Openness reflects engagement with fantasy, perception, and aesthetics. We investigated the extent to which Openness and Intellect are associated with variations in brain structure as measured by cortical thickness, area, and volume (N #8201;= #8201;185). Our results demonstrated that Openness was correlated inversely with cortical thickness and volume in left middle frontal gyrus (BA 6), middle temporal gyrus (MTG, BA 21), and superior temporal gyrus (BA 41), and exclusively with cortical thickness in left inferior parietal lobule (BA 40), right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG, BA 45), and MTG (BA 37). When age and sex were statistically controlled for, the inverse correlations between Openness and cortical thickness remained statistically significant for all regions except left MTG, whereas the correlations involving cortical volume remained statistically significant only for left middle frontal gyrus. There was no statistically significant correlation between Openness and cortical area, and no statistically significant correlation between Intellect and cortical thickness, area, or volume. Our results demonstrate that individual differences in Openness are correlated with variation in brain structure #8212;particularly as indexed by cortical thickness. Given the involvement of the above regions in processes related to memory and cognitive control, we discuss the implications of our findings for the possible contribution of personality to creative cognition.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The title of the post is a copy and paste from the first, fourth, seventh and eight paragraphs of the linked academic press release here :  gt; Individual differences in the personality trait Openness to Experience are associated with variation in brain structure, according to new neuroimaging research.  gt; Openness to experience #8212;defined as the breadth and depth of a person #8217;s experiential life #8212;is of great interest to creativity researchers because people who score higher on this factor also tend to think and behave more creatively.  gt;  #8220;The key finding from our study was that there was a negative correlation between Openness and cortical thickness in regions of the brain that underlie memory and cognitive control. This is an interesting finding because typically reduced cortical thickness is associated with decreased cognitive function, including lower psychometric measures of intelligence, #8221; Vartanian told PsyPost.  gt;  #8220;We believe that the reason why Openness is associated with reduced cortical thickness is that this condition reduces the person #8217;s ability to filter the contents of thought, thereby facilitating greater immersion in the sensory, cognitive, and emotional information that might otherwise have been filtered out of consciousness. #8221; Journal Reference: Structural correlates of Openness and Intellect: Implications for the contribution of personality to creativity Oshin Vartanian Christopher J. Wertz Ranee A. Flores Erin L. Beatty Human Brain Mapping, Volume 39, Issue 7 Doi: https://doi.org/10.1002/hbm.24054 Link: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hbm.24054 Abstract Openness/Intellect (i.e., openness to experience) is the Big Five personality factor most consistently associated with individual differences in creativity. Recent psychometric evidence has demonstrated that this factor consists of two distinct aspects #8212;Intellect and Openness. Whereas Intellect reflects perceived intelligence and intellectual engagement, Openness reflects engagement with fantasy, perception, and aesthetics. We investigated the extent to which Openness and Intellect are associated with variations in brain structure as measured by cortical thickness, area, and volume (N #8201;= #8201;185). Our results demonstrated that Openness was correlated inversely with cortical thickness and volume in left middle frontal gyrus (BA 6), middle temporal gyrus (MTG, BA 21), and superior temporal gyrus (BA 41), and exclusively with cortical thickness in left inferior parietal lobule (BA 40), right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG, BA 45), and MTG (BA 37). When age and sex were statistically controlled for, the inverse correlations between Openness and cortical thickness remained statistically significant for all regions except left MTG, whereas the correlations involving cortical volume remained statistically significant only for left middle frontal gyrus. There was no statistically significant correlation between Openness and cortical area, and no statistically significant correlation between Intellect and cortical thickness, area, or volume. Our results demonstrate that individual differences in Openness are correlated with variation in brain structure #8212;particularly as indexed by cortical thickness. Given the involvement of the above regions in processes related to memory and cognitive control, we discuss the implications of our findings for the possible contribution of personality to creative cognition.</TEXT>

Doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/fam000040 Link: http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2018-09971-001 Abstract Previous studies found important associations between body image, sexual satisfaction, and perceived romantic relationship quality, but mainly focused on one individual #8217;s perceptions rather than both partners. To take the interdependency of romantic partners into account, the present study examined these associations in romantic couples with a dyadic approach. In a cross-sectional design, 151 Dutch heterosexual couples completed an online survey measuring body image, sexual satisfaction, and perceived relationship quality. Hypotheses were tested using the actor #8211;partner interdependence model (APIM) and an APIM extended with a mediator (APIMeM), with couple members #8217; body image as predictors, couple members #8217; sexual satisfaction as mediators, and couple members #8217; relationship quality as outcomes. Results indicated that within individuals, a more positive body image was linked to higher perceived romantic relationship quality through greater sexual satisfaction. No gender differences were found, implying that body image and sexual satisfaction are equally strongly associated with perceived relationship quality in women and men. Results revealed no associations of an individual #8217;s body image and sexual satisfaction with the partner #8217;s perceived relationship quality. These findings implicate that interventions focusing on developing and maintaining a positive body image may be helpful in building on a more satisfying sex life and higher perceived relationship quality.</TEXT>

Schmeichel (2018) Higher trait self-control is associated with less intense visceral states, Self and Identity, DOI: 10.1080/15298868.2018.1495666 Link: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15298868.2018.1495666 ABSTRACT Trait self-control correlates with desirable outcomes including physical and psychological well-being and is thought to facilitate the formation of effective habits. Visceral states, including internal drives that motivate specific behaviors, have been found to undermine self-control. The current study tested the hypothesis that individuals higher in trait self-control experience less intense and a lower likelihood of visceral states and explored possible mediators. We found that trait self-control negatively correlates with responses to one-shot measures of hunger, fatigue, experiencing stress, and experiencing the common cold. Reports of recent sleeping and eating behavior mediated some of these relationships, consistent with the idea that healthful behaviors help individuals higher in trait self-control minimize visceral states. This research supports emerging perspectives on trait self-control #8217;s contributions to positive outcomes.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Journal article: Lourdes S. Martinez, Sharon Hughes, Eric R. Walsh-Buhi  amp; Ming-Hsiang Tsou (2018)  #8220;Okay, We Get It. You Vape #8221;: An Analysis of Geocoded Content, Context, and Sentiment regarding E-Cigarettes on Twitter, Journal of Health Communication, DOI: 10.1080/10810730.2018.1493057 Link: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10810730.2018.1493057 Abstract The current study examined conversations on Twitter related to use and perceptions of e-cigarettes in the United States. We employed the Social Media Analytic and Research Testbed (SMART) dashboard, which was used to identify and download (via a public API) e-cigarette-related geocoded tweets. E-cigarette-related tweets were collected continuously using customized geo-targeted Twitter APIs. A total of 193,051 tweets were collected between October 2015 and February 2016. Of these tweets, a random sample of 973 geocoded tweets were selected and manually coded for information regarding source, context, and message characteristics. Our findings reveal that although over half of tweets were positive, a sizeable portion was negative or neutral. We also found that, among those tweets mentioning a stigma of e-cigarettes, most confirmed that a stigma does exist. Conversely, among tweets mentioning the harmfulness of e-cigarettes, most denied that e-cigarettes were a health hazard. These results suggest that current efforts have left the public with ambiguity regarding the potential dangers of e-cigarettes. Consequently, it is critical to communicate the public health stance on this issue to inform the public and provide counterarguments to the positive sentiments presently dominating conversations about e-cigarettes on social media. The lack of awareness and need to voice a public health position on e-cigarettes represents a vital opportunity to continue winning gains for tobacco control and prevention efforts through health communication interventions targeting e-cigarettes.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Journal article: Lourdes S. Martinez, Sharon Hughes, Eric R. Walsh-Buhi  amp; Ming-Hsiang Tsou (2018)  #8220;Okay, We Get It. You Vape #8221;: An Analysis of Geocoded Content, Context, and Sentiment regarding E-Cigarettes on Twitter, Journal of Health Communication, DOI: 10.1080/10810730.2018.1493057 Link: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10810730.2018.1493057 Abstract The current study examined conversations on Twitter related to use and perceptions of e-cigarettes in the United States. We employed the Social Media Analytic and Research Testbed (SMART) dashboard, which was used to identify and download (via a public API) e-cigarette-related geocoded tweets. E-cigarette-related tweets were collected continuously using customized geo-targeted Twitter APIs. A total of 193,051 tweets were collected between October 2015 and February 2016. Of these tweets, a random sample of 973 geocoded tweets were selected and manually coded for information regarding source, context, and message characteristics. Our findings reveal that although over half of tweets were positive, a sizeable portion was negative or neutral. We also found that, among those tweets mentioning a stigma of e-cigarettes, most confirmed that a stigma does exist. Conversely, among tweets mentioning the harmfulness of e-cigarettes, most denied that e-cigarettes were a health hazard. These results suggest that current efforts have left the public with ambiguity regarding the potential dangers of e-cigarettes. Consequently, it is critical to communicate the public health stance on this issue to inform the public and provide counterarguments to the positive sentiments presently dominating conversations about e-cigarettes on social media. The lack of awareness and need to voice a public health position on e-cigarettes represents a vital opportunity to continue winning gains for tobacco control and prevention efforts through health communication interventions targeting e-cigarettes.</TEXT>

Journal Reference: Neil Garrett, Ana Mar #237;a Gonz #225;lez-Garz #243;n, Lucy Foulkes, Liat Levita, Tali Sharot. Updating Beliefs Under Perceived Threat. The Journal of Neuroscience, 2018; 0716-18 DOI: 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0716-18.2018 Link: http://www.jneurosci.org/content/early/2018/08/06/JNEUROSCI.0716-18.2018 Abstract Humans are better at integrating desirable information into their beliefs than undesirable. This asymmetry poses an evolutionary puzzle, as it can lead to an underestimation of risk and thus failure to take precautionary action. Here, we suggest a mechanism that can speak to this conundrum. In particular, we show that the bias vanishes in response to perceived threat in the environment. We report that an improvement in participants' tendency to incorporate bad news into their beliefs is associated with physiological arousal in response to threat indexed by galvanic skin response and self-reported anxiety. This pattern of results was observed in a controlled laboratory setting (Experiment I), where perceived threat was manipulated, and in firefighters on duty (Experiment II), where it naturally varied. Such flexibility in how individuals integrate information may enhance the likelihood of responding to warnings with caution in environments rife with threat, while maintaining a positivity bias otherwise, a strategy that can increase well-being. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The human tendency to be overly optimistic has mystified scholars and lay people for decades: how could biased beliefs have been selected for over unbiased beliefs? Scholars have suggested that while the optimism bias can lead to negative outcomes, including financial collapse and war, it can also facilitate health and productivity. Here, we demonstrate that a mechanism generating the optimism bias, namely asymmetric information integration, evaporates under threat. Such flexibility could result in enhanced caution in dangerous environments while supporting an optimism bias otherwise, potentially increasing well-being.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The title of the post is a copy and paste from the title and first paragraph of the linked academic press release here :  gt; How kids shape their parents #8217; parenting style  gt; Now a paper in Social Psychological and Personality Science goes further, using the twin approach to reveal how it is mistaken to see the parent-child dynamic as a one-way relationship.  #8220;Given the current evidence  #8230; it is more accurate to conceptualise parenting as a transactional process in which both parents and children exert simultaneous and continuous influence on each other, #8221; write Mona Ayoub at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and her colleagues. Journal Reference: Genetic and Environmental Associations Between Child Personality and Parenting Mona Ayoub, Daniel A. Briley, Andrew Grotzinger, Megan W. Patterson, Laura E. Engelhardt, Jennifer L. Tackett, K. Paige Harden, Elliot M. Tucker-Drob Social Psychological and Personality Science 2018 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1177/1948550618784890 Link: http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1948550618784890 Abstract Parenting is often conceptualized in terms of its effects on offspring. However, children may also play an active role in influencing the parenting they receive. Simple correlations between parenting and child outcomes may be due to parent-to-child causation, child-to-parent causation, or some combination of the two. We use a multirater, genetically informative, large sample (n = 1,411 twin sets) to gain traction on this issue as it relates to parental warmth and stress in the context of child Big Five personality. Considerable variance in parental warmth (27%) and stress (45%) was attributable to child genetic influences on parenting. Incorporating child Big Five personality into the model roughly explained half of this variance. This result is consistent with the hypothesis that parents mold their parenting in response to their child #8217;s personality. Residual heritability of parenting is likely due to child characteristics beyond the Big Five.</TEXT>

Design Prospective cohort design. Participants There were 1958 children aged 7 to 12 years from the Taiwan 2009 National Health Interview Survey who were linked to the 2009 through 2013 claims data from the National Health Insurance system. Methods Multivariable Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate the associations between 3 types of near visual activities in sedentary posture, namely reading ( lt; 0.5, 0.5-0.9,  #8805;1.0 hours per day [h/d]), use of computer, Internet, and games ( lt;0.5, 0.5-0.9,  #8805;1.0 h/d), and  #8220;cram school #8221; attendance ( lt;0.5, 0.5-1.9,  #8805;2.0 h/d), and incident myopia. Main Outcome Measures Prevalent myopia was defined as those who had  #8805;2 ambulatory care claims (International Classification of Diseases code 367.1) in 2008-2009. Incident myopia was defined by those who had at least 2 ambulatory care claims (International Classification of Diseases code 367.1) during the 4-year follow-up period (2010-2013) after excluding prevalent cases. Results Overall, 26.8% of children had myopia at baseline, and 27.7% of those without myopia at baseline developed incident myopia between 2010 and 2013. On average, they spent 0.68 #177;0.86 h/d on computer/Internet use, 0.63 #177;0.67 h/d on reading, and 2.78 #177;3.53 h/d on cram school. The results showed that children attending cram schools  #8805;2 h/d (hazard ratio, 1.31; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-1.68) had a higher risk of incident myopia. The effects of these activities remained similar in sensitivity analyses. Conclusions Cram school attendance for  #8805;2 h/d may increase the risk of children #8217;s incident myopia. This effect may be due to increased near visual activity or reduced time outdoors.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The title of the post is a copy and paste from the third paragraph of the linked academic press release here :  gt; A new study appearing in Ophthalmology, the journal of the American Academy of Ophthalmology, offers further evidence that at least part of the worldwide increase in nearsightedness has to do with near work activities; not just screens but also traditional books. And, that spending time outdoors #8212;especially in early childhood #8212;can slow the progression of nearsightedness.

Design Prospective cohort design. Participants There were 1958 children aged 7 to 12 years from the Taiwan 2009 National Health Interview Survey who were linked to the 2009 through 2013 claims data from the National Health Insurance system. Methods Multivariable Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate the associations between 3 types of near visual activities in sedentary posture, namely reading ( lt; 0.5, 0.5-0.9,  #8805;1.0 hours per day [h/d]), use of computer, Internet, and games ( lt;0.5, 0.5-0.9,  #8805;1.0 h/d), and  #8220;cram school #8221; attendance ( lt;0.5, 0.5-1.9,  #8805;2.0 h/d), and incident myopia.

    <TEXT>Journal Reference: Neil Garrett, Ana Mar #237;a Gonz #225;lez-Garz #243;n, Lucy Foulkes, Liat Levita, Tali Sharot. Updating Beliefs Under Perceived Threat. The Journal of Neuroscience, 2018; 0716-18 DOI: 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0716-18.2018 Link: http://www.jneurosci.org/content/early/2018/08/06/JNEUROSCI.0716-18.2018 Abstract Humans are better at integrating desirable information into their beliefs than undesirable. This asymmetry poses an evolutionary puzzle, as it can lead to an underestimation of risk and thus failure to take precautionary action. Here, we suggest a mechanism that can speak to this conundrum. In particular, we show that the bias vanishes in response to perceived threat in the environment. We report that an improvement in participants' tendency to incorporate bad news into their beliefs is associated with physiological arousal in response to threat indexed by galvanic skin response and self-reported anxiety. This pattern of results was observed in a controlled laboratory setting (Experiment I), where perceived threat was manipulated, and in firefighters on duty (Experiment II), where it naturally varied. Such flexibility in how individuals integrate information may enhance the likelihood of responding to warnings with caution in environments rife with threat, while maintaining a positivity bias otherwise, a strategy that can increase well-being. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The human tendency to be overly optimistic has mystified scholars and lay people for decades: how could biased beliefs have been selected for over unbiased beliefs? Scholars have suggested that while the optimism bias can lead to negative outcomes, including financial collapse and war, it can also facilitate health and productivity. Here, we demonstrate that a mechanism generating the optimism bias, namely asymmetric information integration, evaporates under threat. Such flexibility could result in enhanced caution in dangerous environments while supporting an optimism bias otherwise, potentially increasing well-being.</TEXT>

Journal Reference: Political Socialization, Worry about Crime and Antisocial Behaviour: An Analysis of Age, Period and Cohort Effects Emily Gray Maria Grasso Stephen Farrall Will Jennings Colin Hay The British Journal of Criminology, azy024, DOI: https://doi.org/10.1093/bjc/azy024 Published: 07 August 2018 Link: https://academic.oup.com/bjc/advance-article/doi/10.1093/bjc/azy024/5067283 Abstract Fear of crime occupies a substantial area of research and theorizing in criminology. Yet, it has not been examined within a longitudinal framework of political socialization. Using insights from generational modelling, we explore how political cohorts influence the fear of crime and perceptions of antisocial behaviour. This  #8216;age, period and cohort #8217; (APC) approach recognizes the distinct temporal processes of (1) individual ageing, (2) current contexts and (3) generational membership and is crucial to understanding the origins and shape of social change. We employ repeated cross-sectional data from the British Crime Survey in an APC analysis to explore how worry about crime and perceptions of antisocial behaviour were impacted by the sociopolitical environment in which respondents spent their  #8216;formative years #8217;. Our results underline the theoretical significance of political socialization and the methodological consequence of longitudinal analyses when exploring public perceptions of crime. We find that political socialization can have a distinctive and enduring impression on public perceptions of crime from childhood into middle age.</TEXT>

DOI: https://doi.org/10.1002/ab.21751 Link: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ab.21751 Abstract Alcohol use and abuse (e.g., binge drinking) are among the most reliable causes of aggressive behavior. Conversely, people with aggressive dispositions (e.g., intermittent explosive disorder) are at greater risk for subsequent substance abuse. Yet it remains unknown why aggression might promote subsequent alcohol use. Both aggressive acts and alcohol use are rewarding and linked to greater activity in neural reward circuitry. Through this shared instantiation of reward, aggression may then increase subsequent alcohol consumption. Supporting this mechanistic hypothesis, participants #8217; aggressive behavior directed at someone who had recently rejected them, was associated with more subsequent beer consumption on an ad #8208;lib drinking task. Using functional MRI, both aggressive behavior and beer consumption were associated with greater activity in the bilateral ventral striatum during acts of retaliatory aggression. These results imply that aggression is linked to subsequent alcohol abuse, and that a mechanism underlying this effect is likely to be the activation of the brain's reward circuitry during aggressive acts.</TEXT>

Our ancestors, they explained, lived in small, highly interdependent bands and faced frequent life-threatening reversals.

To incline choice, the pride system must compute for a potential action an anticipated pride intensity that tracks the magnitude of the approval or deference that the action would generate among local audiences. Data from industrial mass societies support this expectation. However, it is presently not known whether those data reflect cultural evolutionary processes or a panhuman adaptation. Experiments conducted in 10 traditional small-scale societies with widely varying cultures and subsistence modes replicate the pattern observed in mass societies.

Abstract Becoming valuable to fellow group members so that one would attract assistance in times of need is a major adaptive problem. To solve it, the individual needs a predictive map of the degree to which others value different acts so that, in choosing how to act, the payoff arising from others #8217; valuation of a potential action (e.g., showing bandmates that one is a skilled forager by pursuing a hard-to-acquire prey item) can be added to the direct payoff of the action (e.g., gaining the nutrients of the prey captured). The pride system seems to incorporate all of the elements necessary to solve this adaptive problem. Importantly, data from western(-ized), educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic (WEIRD) societies indicate close quantitative correspondences between pride and the valuations of audiences. Do those results generalize beyond industrial mass societies? To find out, we conducted an experiment among 567 participants in 10 small-scale societies scattered across Central and South America, Africa, and Asia: (i) Bosaw #225;s Reserve, Nicaragua; (ii) Cotopaxi, Ecuador; (iii) Dr #226;a-Tafilalet, Morocco; (iv) Enugu, Nigeria; (v) Le Morne, Mauritius; (vi) La Gaulette, Mauritius; (vii) Tuva, Russia; (viii) Shaanxi and Henan, China; (ix) farming communities in Japan; and (x) fishing communities in Japan. Despite widely varying languages, cultures, and subsistence modes, pride in each community closely tracked the valuation of audiences locally (mean r = +0.66) and even across communities (mean r = +0.29). This suggests that the pride system not only develops the same functional architecture everywhere but also operates with a substantial degree of universality in its content.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Journal reference: Seeing you in me Preliminary evidence for perceptual overlap between self and close others Sarah Ketay, Lindsey A. Beck, Suzanne Riela, Cristen Bailey, Arthur Aron First Published July 24, 2018 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1177/0265407518788702 Link: http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0265407518788702 Abstract Inclusion of other in the self, a key principle of the self-expansion model, suggests that close others overlap with the self in terms of resources, perspectives, and identities. Research from behavioral, cognitive, and neural domains provides evidence for inclusion of other in the self; the present research extends prior theoretical and empirical work to a new, visual domain by investigating whether inclusion of other in the self applies to facial processing. In two reaction time (RT) experiments, participants viewed static (Study 1) and morphed (Study 2) facial images of themselves, their close friend (i.e., a close other), and a familiar celebrity (i.e., a non-close other). In Study 1, participants showed slower RTs when comparing their own image with their friend #8217;s image than when comparing their own image with a celebrity #8217;s image. In Study 2, participants showed slower RTs when their own image was morphed with their friend #8217;s image than when their own image was morphed with the celebrity #8217;s image. These results suggest that inclusion of close others in the self extends to visual processing. Implications and limitations are discussed.</TEXT>

Journal Reference: Eva Latorre, Roberta Torregrossa, Mark E. Wood, Matthew Whiteman, Lorna W. Harries. Mitochondria-targeted hydrogen sulfide attenuates endothelial senescence by selective induction of splicing factors HNRNPD and SRSF2. Aging, 2018; DOI: 10.18632/aging.101500 Link: http://www.aging-us.com/article/101500/text Abstract Cellular senescence is a key driver of ageing, influenced by age-related changes to the regulation of alternative splicing. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) has similarly been described to influence senescence, but the pathways by which it accomplishes this are unclear. We assessed the effects of the slow release H2S donor Na-GYY4137 (100  #181;g/ml), and three novel mitochondria-targeted H2S donors AP39, AP123 and RT01 (10 ng/ml) on splicing factor expression, cell proliferation, apoptosis, DNA replication, DNA damage, telomere length and senescence-related secretory complex (SASP) expression in senescent primary human endothelial cells. All H2S donors produced up to a 50% drop in senescent cell load assessed at the biochemical and molecular level. Some changes were noted in the composition of senescence-related secretory complex (SASP); IL8 levels increased by 24% but proliferation was not re-established in the culture as a whole. Telomere length, apoptotic index and the extent of DNA damage were unaffected. Differential effects on splicing factor expression were observed depending on the intracellular targeting of the H2S donors. Na-GYY4137 produced a general 1.9  #8211; 3.2-fold upregulation of splicing factor expression, whereas the mitochondria-targeted donors produced a specific 2.5 and 3.1-fold upregulation of SRSF2 and HNRNPD splicing factors only. Knockdown of SRSF2 or HNRNPD genes in treated cells rendered the cells non-responsive to H2S, and increased levels of senescence by up to 25% in untreated cells. Our data suggest that SRSF2 and HNRNPD may be implicated in endothelial cell senescence, and can be targeted by exogenous H2S. These molecules may have potential as moderators of splicing factor expression and senescence phenotypes.</TEXT>

The purpose of this study was to examine college students #8217; dietary choices during alcohol consumption and on the following day by gender and level of alcohol consumption (including none). Methods: Ethnically diverse undergraduates (N = 286; 52% male, 48% female, M age = 19, SD age = 1) at a public university in the Midwest completed an anonymous on-line survey. The survey included Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System nutrition items, items on consumption of "empty calorie foods," and open-ended response items on dietary choices that were coded by a nutritionist. Results: Participants reported differences in the likelihoods of consuming non-nutrient dense foods after drinking alcohol both before sleeping and the next day compared to at other times when they were not consuming alcohol. Conclusion: College students are more likely to eat after drinking alcohol and tend to consume less healthy foods.

Existing electrical and chemical tools cannot offer specific neural modulation while optogenetics has limitations for deep tissue interfaces, which might be overcome by miniaturized optoelectronic devices in the future. Here, a 3D magnetic hyaluronic hydrogel is described that offers noninvasive neuromodulation via magnetomechanical stimulation of primary dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. The hydrogel shares similar biochemical and biophysical properties as the extracellular matrix of spinal cord, facilitating healthy growth of functional neurites and expression of excitatory and inhibitory ion channels. By testing with different neurotoxins, and micropillar substrate deflections with electrophysical recordings, it is found that acute magnetomechanical stimulation induces calcium influx in DRG neurons primarily via endogenous, mechanosensitive TRPV4 and PIEZO2 channels. Next, capitalizing on the receptor adaptation characteristic of DRG neurons, chronic magnetomechanical stimulation is performed and found that it reduces the expression of PIEZO2 channels, which can be useful for modulating pain where mechanosensitive channels are typically overexpressed. A general strategy is thus offered for neuroscientists and material scientists to fabricate 3D magnetic biomaterials tailored to different types of excitable cells for remote magnetomechanical modulation.</TEXT>

Association of IgE-Mediated Allergy With Risk of Complicated Appendicitis in a Pediatric Population. JAMA Pediatrics, 2018; DOI: 10.1001/jamapediatrics.2018.1634 Link: https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/article-abstract/2694800 Key Points Question Do children with IgE-mediated allergy have a lower risk of complicated appendicitis? Findings In this cohort study of 605 children undergoing appendectomy, those with IgE-mediated allergy had a 3 times lower risk of complicated appendicitis compared with those without allergy. Meaning These findings present previously unknown risk factors for complicated appendicitis and shed light on pathogenesis and clinical detection of adverse outcomes. Abstract Importance Childhood appendicitis is commonly complicated by gangrene and perforation, yet the causes of complicated appendicitis and how to avoid it remain unknown. Objective To investigate whether children with IgE-mediated allergy have a lower risk of complicated appendicitis. Design, Setting, and Participants This retrospective cohort study included all consecutive patients younger than 15 years (hereinafter referred to as children) who underwent appendectomy for acute appendicitis at a tertiary pediatric surgery center in Sweden between January 1, 2007, through July 31, 2017. Children were stratified between those with and without IgE-mediated allergies. Main Outcome and Measures Risk of complicated appendicitis with gangrene or perforation, with occurrence of IgE-mediated allergy as an independent variable and adjusted for age, sex, primary health care contacts, seasonal antigenic exposure, allergy medications, appendicolith, and duration of symptoms. Results Of 605 included children (63.0% boys; median age, 10 years; interquartile range, 7-12 years), 102 (16.9%) had IgE-mediated allergy and 503 (83.1%) had no allergy. Complicated appendicitis occurred in 20 children with IgE-mediated allergy (19.6%) compared with 236 with no allergy (46.9%; adjusted odds ratio, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.18-0.59). No significant allergy effect modification by sex, seasonal antigenic exposure, or allergy medication was found. Children with IgE-mediated allergy had a shorter hospital stay (median, 2 days for both groups; interquartile range, 1-2 days vs 1-5 days; P #8201;= #8201;.004). Conclusions and Relevance In this study, children with IgE-mediated allergy had a lower risk of complicated appendicitis. The findings suggest that immunologic disposition modifies the clinical pattern of appendiceal disease. This theory introduces novel opportunities for understanding of the pathogenesis and clinical decision making for one of childhood #8217;s most common surgical emergencies.</TEXT>

Results Of 605 included children (63.0% boys; median age, 10 years; interquartile range, 7-12 years), 102 (16.9%) had IgE-mediated allergy and 503 (83.1%) had no allergy. Complicated appendicitis occurred in 20 children with IgE-mediated allergy (19.6%) compared with 236 with no allergy (46.9%; adjusted odds ratio, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.18-0.59). No significant allergy effect modification by sex, seasonal antigenic exposure, or allergy medication was found. Children with IgE-mediated allergy had a shorter hospital stay (median, 2 days for both groups; interquartile range, 1-2 days vs 1-5 days; P #8201;= #8201;.004). Conclusions and Relevance In this study, children with IgE-mediated allergy had a lower risk of complicated appendicitis. The findings suggest that immunologic disposition modifies the clinical pattern of appendiceal disease. This theory introduces novel opportunities for understanding of the pathogenesis and clinical decision making for one of childhood #8217;s most common surgical emergencies.</TEXT>

The linked article had a been more background information. Journal reference: Yannick Stephan, Angelina R. Sutin, Anna Kornadt, Johan Caudroit, Antonio Terracciano, Higher IQ in adolescence is related to a younger subjective age in later life: Findings from the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study, Intelligence, Volume 69, 2018, Pages 195-199, ISSN 0160-2896, DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intell.2018.06.006. Link: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289617303598 Highlights  #8226; Higher IQ in adolescence was related to a younger subjective age 50 #8239;years later.  #8226; This association was mediated by higher openness to experience.  #8226; Higher intelligence in adolescence is a resource that promotes subjective aging. Abstract: Subjective age predicts consequential outcomes in old age, including risk of hospitalization, dementia, and mortality. Studies investigating the determinants of subjective age have mostly focused on aging-related factors measured in adulthood and old age. Little is known about the extent to which early life factors may contribute to later life subjective age. The present study examined the prospective association between IQ in adolescence and subjective age in later life and tested education, disease burden, adult cognition, and personality traits as potential mediators. Participants (N #8239;= #8239;4494) were drawn from the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study. Data on IQ were obtained in 1957 when participants were in high school. Education, disease burden, cognition, and personality were assessed in 1992 #8211;1993, and subjective age was measured in 2011 at age 71 (SD #8239;= #8239;0.93). Accounting for demographic factors, results revealed that higher IQ in adolescence was associated with a younger subjective age in late life. Bootstrap analysis further showed that this association was mediated by higher openness. The present study suggests that how old or young individuals feel is partly influenced by lifespan developmental processes that may begin with early life cognitive ability.</TEXT>

To date, no empirical work has directly evaluated how young adults weigh these relationships against one another. We conducted a preregistered experiment in which we pitted outcomes for parents against outcomes for friends. Participants (N = 174, ages 18 #8211;30 years) played two runs of the Columbia Card Task #8212;one in which gains benefited a parent and losses were incurred by a friend and another in which the opposite was true. We also tested whether age, relationship quality, and reward type earned for parents and friends (simulated vs. real) acted as moderating influences on parent #8211;friend prioritization. Results showed that individuals were more likely to make decisions that benefited a parent at the expense of a friend. Relationship quality and reward type moderated this effect, whereas age did not.</TEXT>

Journal Reference: Menifield, C. E., Shin, G. and Strother, L. (2018), Do White Law Enforcement Officers Target Minority Suspects?. Public Admin Rev. 2018 doi:10.1111/puar.12956 Link: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/puar.12956 Abstract The debate over possible bias in the use of deadly force has recently been exacerbated by highly publicized killings of African American males around the country. While much research has been conducted examining police behavior, little has been done to investigate the impact of race on police behavior. This article aims to answer this question: are white police officers more likely to use lethal force on minority suspects or people of a specific race? To answer this question, the authors construct a data set of all confirmed uses of lethal force by police officers in the United States in 2014 and 2015. They find that although minority suspects are disproportionately killed by police, white officers appear to be no more likely to use lethal force against minorities than nonwhite officers.</TEXT>

Abstract: Treatment resistant major depressive disorder (TR-MDD) is a severe disease, with very low remission rates.

Animal therapy has been used in patients with psychiatric conditions and the results have been promising. However, there have been no studies in TR-MDD patients with pet adoption. This study assessed the impact of TR-MDD patients adopting a pet. Eighty patients were suggested to adopt a pet, and 33 accepted the challenge. Other 33 patients constituted the control group (did not accept the suggestion of pet adoption and did not already have a pet). All patients maintained their usual pharmacotherapy. All participants were evaluated at baseline, 4, 8 and 12 weeks for depressive symptoms using HAMD17 and GAF. Results show that the pet group had an improvement in HAMD17 and GAF scores as well as higher response and remission rates compared to the control group, where no patient responded or remitted.

    <TEXT>The title of the post is a copy and paste from the title and second paragraph of the linked academic press release here :  gt; Men are still more likely than women to be perceived as leaders, study finds  gt; The study, which was made available online in March ahead of publication in the August print edition of Personnel Psychology, found that, on average, men are more likely than women to emerge as leaders. Journal Reference: Katie L. Badura, Emily Grijalva, Daniel A. Newman, Thomas Taiyi Yan, Gahyun Jeon. Gender and leadership emergence: A meta-analysis and explanatory model. Personnel Psychology, 2018; 71 (3): 335 DOI: 10.1111/peps.12266 Link: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/peps.12266 Abstract Research has shown that men tend to emerge as leaders more frequently than women. However, societal role expectations for both women and leaders have changed in the decades since the last empirical review of the gender gap in leader emergence (Eagly  amp; Karau, 1991). We leverage meta #8208;analytic evidence to demonstrate that the gender gap has decreased over time, but a contemporary gap remains. To understand why this gap in leader emergence occurs, we draw on social role theory to develop a Gender #8208;Agency/Communion #8208;Participation (GAP) Model #8212;an integrative theoretical model that includes both trait and behavioral mechanisms. Specifically, we examine a sequence of effects: from gender to agentic and communal personality traits, from these traits to behavioral participation in group activities, and ultimately from participation to leader emergence. The model is tested using original meta #8208;analyses of the personality and behavioral mechanisms (coding 1,632 effect sizes total). Gender differences in leadership emergence are predominately explained by agentic traits (positive) and communal traits (negative), both directly and through the mechanism of participation in group discussions. In addition, several paths in the theoretical model are moderated by situational contingencies. Our study enhances knowledge of the mechanisms and boundary conditions underlying the gender gap in leader emergence.</TEXT>

Abstract: Atmospheric entry aerodynamic decelerators which also provide thermal protection do not scale well for smaller payloads (e.g. CubeSat) or where the planets atmosphere is significantly less dense than the Earth's (e.g. Mars entry).

Structural dynamic analyses including the trajectory simulation on a CubeSat sized system has shown that the autorotation and deployment form a closed loop which reliably leads to an equilibrium of deployment, while the heat shield is near fully deployed at altitudes higher than 30 #8239;km with tolerable spin rate ( lt;6 rps) and oscillation.

Link: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/30028211/ Abstract Sexual difficulties are common among women and men and are associated with various mental and physical health problems. Although psychological traits are known to impact sexual attitudes and behavior, sexuality- and personality-related traits have not been jointly investigated to assess their relevance for sexual functioning in couples. The aim of this study was to investigate how psychological traits of two partners influence women's and men's sexual function. Data from 964 couples, representative of the adult population in Germany, were analyzed. Sexual function was assessed with the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) and the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF). Sexuality-related traits were measured with the Sexual Excitation/Sexual Inhibition Inventory for Women and Men (SESII-W/M). Personality was measured with self-report and partner-rating versions of the Big Five Inventory (BFI). Sexual excitation was a positive and sexual inhibition was a negative predictor of sexual function in both genders. Women whose partners were sexually inhibited reported lower sexual function. Conscientious individuals reported better sexual function. Women whose partners were more conscientious also had better sexual function. Assessing partner-related factors may be helpful to identify predisposing and maintaining factors of sexual dysfunctions, especially in women.</TEXT>

Only those trajectory groups with weak cognitive control, characterized as  #8220;high-increasing #8221; acting-without thinking and  #8220;high-stable #8221; delay discounting were predictive of a maladaptive risk-taking outcome, namely substance use disorder. Sensation seeking demonstrated a universal peak, but high levels of sensation seeking were not associated with weakness in cognitive control and were unrelated to substance use disorder, controlling for impulsivity. The findings suggest that maladaptive risk-taking characterized by weak cognitive control over reward-driven impulses is a phenomenon limited to only a sub-set of youth.</TEXT>

Journal Reference: Bar-Zeev N, King C, Phiri T, Beard J, Mvula H, Crampin AC, et al. Impact of monovalent rotavirus vaccine on diarrhoea-associated post-neonatal infant mortality in rural communities in Malawi: a population-based birth cohort study. Lancet Glob Health 2018; 6: e1036-44 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S2214-109X(18)30314-0 Link: https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(18)30314-0/fulltext Summary Background Rotavirus is a major contributor to child mortality. The effect of rotavirus vaccine on diarrhoea mortality has been estimated in middle-income but not low-income settings, where mortality is high and vaccine effectiveness in reducing admissions to hospital is lower. Empirical population-based mortality studies have not been done in any setting. Malawi introduced monovalent rotavirus vaccine (RV1) in October, 2012. We aimed to investigate the impact and effectiveness of the RV1 vaccine in reducing diarrhoea-associated mortality in infants aged 10 #8211;51 weeks. Methods In this population-based cohort study, we included infants born between Jan 1, 2012, and June 1, 2015, in Mchinji, Central Malawi and analysed data on those surviving 10 weeks. Individual vaccination status was extracted from caregiver-held records or report at home visits at 4 months and 1 year of age. Survival to 1 year was confirmed at home visit, or cause of death ascertained by verbal autopsy. We assessed impact (1 minus mortality rate ratio following vs before vaccine introduction) using Poisson regression. Among vaccine-eligible infants (born from Sept 17, 2012), we assessed effectiveness (1 minus hazard ratio) using Cox regression. Findings Between Jan 1, 2012, and June 1, 2015, we recruited 48 #8200;672 livebirths in Mchinji, among whom 38 #8200;518 were vaccine-eligible and 37 #8200;570 survived to age 10 weeks. Two-dose versus zero-dose effectiveness analysis included 28 #8200;141 infants, of whom 101 had diarrhoea-associated death before 1 year of age. Diarrhoea-associated mortality declined by 31% (95% CI 1 #8211;52; p=0 #183;04) after RV1 introduction. Effectiveness against diarrhoea-mortality was 34% (95% CI  #8211;28 to 66; p=0 #183;22). Interpretation RV1 was associated with substantial reduction in diarrhoea-associated deaths among infants in this rural sub-Saharan African setting. These data add considerable weight to evidence showing the impact of rotavirus vaccine programmes.</TEXT>

JAMA Network Open, 2018; 1 (4): e181662 DOI: 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2018.1662 Link: https://jamanetworkopen.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?doi=10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2018.1662 Key Points Question What are the prevalence and estimated economic burden of substandard and falsified medicines in low- and middle-income countries? Findings In this systematic review of 265 studies comprising 400 #8239;647 drug samples and meta-analysis of 96 studies comprising 67 #8239;839 drug samples, the prevalence of substandard and falsified medicines in low- and middle-income countries was 13.6% overall (19.1% for antimalarials and 12.4% for antibiotics). Data on the estimated economic impact were limited primarily to market size and ranged widely from $10 billion to $200 billion. Meaning Substandard and falsified medicines are a substantial health and economic problem; a concerted global effort is needed to secure the global supply chain, increase quality control capacity, and improve surveillance to better assess the problem and identify solutions. Abstract Importance Substandard and falsified medicines burden health systems by diverting resources to ineffective or harmful therapies, causing medical complications and prolonging illnesses. However, the prevalence and economic impact of poor-quality medicines is unclear. Objective To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the prevalence and estimated economic burden of substandard and falsified essential medicines in low- and middle-income countries. Data Sources Five databases (PubMed, EconLit, Global Health, Embase, and Scopus) were searched from inception until November 3, 2017. Study Selection Publications were assessed to determine whether they examined medicine quality and the prevalence and/or economic burden of substandard and falsified medicines in low- and middle-income countries. Studies with a sample size of 50 or more were included in the meta-analysis. Data Extraction and Synthesis The study is registered in PROSPERO and reported via the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) reporting guidelines. Study quality was assessed using an adapted Medicine Quality Assessment Reporting Guidelines scoring metric. Multiple reviewers conducted the data extraction and quality assessment independently. Main Outcomes and Measures Prevalence and/or estimated economic impact of substandard and falsified medicines. Results Two hundred sixty-five studies that estimated the prevalence of poor-quality essential medicines in low- and middle-income countries were identified. Among 96 studies that tested 50 samples or more (67 #8239;839 total drug samples), overall prevalence of poor-quality medicines was 13.6% (95% CI, 11.0%-16.3%), with regional prevalence of 18.7% in Africa (95% CI, 12.9%-24.5%) and 13.7% in Asia (95% CI, 8.2%-19.1%). Of studies included in the meta-analysis, 19.1% (95% CI, 15.0%-23.3%) of antimalarials and 12.4% (95% CI, 7.1%-17.7%) of antibiotics were substandard or falsified. Eight approximations of the economic impact, focused primarily on market size, with poor or undisclosed methods in estimation were identified, ranging from $10 billion to $200 billion. Conclusions and Relevance Poor-quality essential medicines are a substantial and understudied problem. Methodological standards for prevalence and rigorous economic studies estimating the burden beyond market size are needed to accurately assess the scope of the issue and inform efforts to address it. Global collaborative efforts are needed to improve supply-chain management, surveillance, and regulatory capacity in low- and middle-income countries to reduce the threat of poor-quality medicines.</TEXT>

Journal Reference: Bar-Zeev N, King C, Phiri T, Beard J, Mvula H, Crampin AC, et al. Impact of monovalent rotavirus vaccine on diarrhoea-associated post-neonatal infant mortality in rural communities in Malawi: a population-based birth cohort study. Lancet Glob Health 2018; 6: e1036-44 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S2214-109X(18)30314-0 Link: https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(18)30314-0/fulltext Summary Background Rotavirus is a major contributor to child mortality. The effect of rotavirus vaccine on diarrhoea mortality has been estimated in middle-income but not low-income settings, where mortality is high and vaccine effectiveness in reducing admissions to hospital is lower. Empirical population-based mortality studies have not been done in any setting. Malawi introduced monovalent rotavirus vaccine (RV1) in October, 2012. We aimed to investigate the impact and effectiveness of the RV1 vaccine in reducing diarrhoea-associated mortality in infants aged 10 #8211;51 weeks. Methods In this population-based cohort study, we included infants born between Jan 1, 2012, and June 1, 2015, in Mchinji, Central Malawi and analysed data on those surviving 10 weeks. Individual vaccination status was extracted from caregiver-held records or report at home visits at 4 months and 1 year of age. Survival to 1 year was confirmed at home visit, or cause of death ascertained by verbal autopsy. We assessed impact (1 minus mortality rate ratio following vs before vaccine introduction) using Poisson regression. Among vaccine-eligible infants (born from Sept 17, 2012), we assessed effectiveness (1 minus hazard ratio) using Cox regression. Findings Between Jan 1, 2012, and June 1, 2015, we recruited 48 #8200;672 livebirths in Mchinji, among whom 38 #8200;518 were vaccine-eligible and 37 #8200;570 survived to age 10 weeks. Two-dose versus zero-dose effectiveness analysis included 28 #8200;141 infants, of whom 101 had diarrhoea-associated death before 1 year of age. Diarrhoea-associated mortality declined by 31% (95% CI 1 #8211;52; p=0 #183;04) after RV1 introduction. Effectiveness against diarrhoea-mortality was 34% (95% CI  #8211;28 to 66; p=0 #183;22). Interpretation RV1 was associated with substantial reduction in diarrhoea-associated deaths among infants in this rural sub-Saharan African setting. These data add considerable weight to evidence showing the impact of rotavirus vaccine programmes.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The title of the post is a copy and paste from the second, fifth and sixth paragraphs of the linked academic press release here :  gt; Red flag laws, also known as gun violence restraining order laws or extreme risk protection order laws (ERPO), institute a legal process with the aim of preventing gun violence perpetrated by those who pose a risk of injury to themselves or others.  gt; In the 10 years following its enactment, Indiana #8217;s law was associated with an estimated 7.5 percent fewer firearm suicides ( #8220;larger than that seen in any comparison state by chance alone, #8221; Kivisto and Phalen wrote). Connecticut #8217;s law was associated with a 1.6 percent reduction prior the Virginia Tech mass shooting in 2007. After the shooting, which precipitated increased enforcement of the law, firearm suicides through 2015 were reduced by an estimated 13.7 percent.  gt; There was also, however, evidence of a replacement effect, where a decrease in firearm-related suicides is accompanied by a rise in suicides by other means. Journal Reference: Effects of Risk-Based Firearm Seizure Laws in Connecticut and Indiana on Suicide Rates, 1981 #8211;2015 Aaron J. Kivisto and Peter Lee Phalen Psychiatric Services 2018 69:8, 855-862 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.ps.201700250 Link: https://ps.psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.ps.201700250 Abstract Objective: This study evaluated whether risk-based firearm seizure laws in Connecticut and Indiana affect suicide rates. Methods: A quasi-experimental design using annual state-level panel data from the 50 states between 1981 and 2015 was used. When analyses controlled for a range of risk factors for population-level suicide rates, the effects of Connecticut and Indiana #8217;s firearm seizure laws on firearm and nonfirearm suicide rates were evaluated by using the synthetic-control methodology and difference-in-place placebo tests. Sensitivity analyses employed regression-based difference-in-differences analyses with randomization inference. Results: Indiana #8217;s firearm seizure law was associated with a 7.5% reduction in firearm suicides in the ten years following its enactment, an effect specific to suicides with firearms and larger than that seen in any comparison state by chance alone. Enactment of Connecticut #8217;s law was associated with a 1.6% reduction in firearm suicides immediately after its passage and a 13.7% reduction in firearm suicides in the post #8211;Virginia Tech period, when enforcement of the law substantially increased. Regression-based sensitivity analyses showed that these findings were robust to alternative specifications. Whereas Indiana demonstrated an aggregate decrease in suicides, Connecticut #8217;s estimated reduction in firearm suicides was offset by increased nonfirearm suicides. Conclusions: Risk-based firearm seizure laws were associated with reduced population-level firearm suicide rates, and evidence for a replacement effect was mixed.</TEXT>

The current paper puts forward an evolutionary theoretical framework, where people stay single for three main reasons, namely the mismatch between ancestral and modern conditions has resulted in several individuals lacking the adaptations necessary for attracting and retaining mates, individuals can increase their fitness by opting out of relationships, and individuals have constraints that prevent them from attracting a mate. The paper attempted to identify the reasons that drive men to be single and to investigate whether they were consistent with the proposed theoretical framework. More specifically, 13,429 responses from a recent Reddit thread were analyzed, and 6794 responses were coded and classified in 43 categories. Among the most frequent reasons that men indicated for being single included poor flirting skills, low self-confidence, poor looks, shyness, low effort, and bad experience from previous relationships.</TEXT>

The association of parental belief was independent of the offspring #8217;s own belief in the importance of religion and other parental risk factors and was statistically significant. Meaning Among various risk factors for suicidal behavior in offspring, parental religious beliefs should not be overlooked. Abstract Importance Previous studies have shown an inverse association between offspring religiosity and suicidal ideation/attempts, but the association of parent religiosity on offspring suicidal ideation/attempts has not been examined. Objective To examine associations of parent and offspring religiosity with suicide ideation and attempts in offspring. Design, Setting, and Participants The study is based on offspring (generation 3) from a 3-generation family study at New York State Psychiatric Institute and Columbia University, in which generations 2 and 3 were defined as being at high risk or low risk for major depressive disorder because of the presence or absence of major depressive disorder in generation 1. The association between suicidal behaviors (ideation/attempts) and parent and offspring religiosity in generation 3 offspring aged 6 to 18 years (214 offspring from 112 nuclear families) was examined. Main Outcomes and Measures Parents #8217; psychiatric diagnoses and suicidal behaviors were assessed with the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia, and offspring were independently assessed using the child version. Two measures of religiosity were assessed: religious importance and religious attendance. Logistic regressions in the framework of generalized estimation equations were performed to analyze offspring suicidal behaviors while adjusting for sibling correlation and offspring age, sex, and familial depression risk status. Results Of 214 offspring, 112 (52.3%) were girls. Offspring religious importance was associated with a lower risk for suicidal behavior in girls (odds ratio [OR], #8201;0.48; 95% CI, 0.33-0.70) but not in boys (OR, #8201;1.15; 95% CI, 0.74-1.80) (religiosity by sex interaction, P #8201;= #8201;.05). Religious attendance was associated with a lower risk for suicidal behavior in girls (OR, #8201;0.64; 95% CI, 0.49-0.84) but not boys (OR, #8201;0.94; 95% CI, 0.69-1.27) (religiosity by sex interaction, P #8201;= #8201;.17). Parent religious importance was associated with a lower risk for offspring suicidal behavior (OR, #8201;0.61; 95% CI, 0.41-0.91) but not parent religious attendance. When parent and offspring religious importance were considered simultaneously, we found a lower risk associated with parental religious importance (OR, #8201;0.61; 95% CI, 0.39-0.96) independent of offspring importance. These associations were independent of parental depression, marital status, and parental suicide ideation. Conclusions and Relevance In this study, parental belief in religious importance was associated with lower risk for suicidal behavior in offspring independent of an offspring #8217;s own belief about religious importance and other known parental factors, such as parental depression, suicidal behavior, and divorce.</TEXT>

We found that while incarcerated offenders showed a high rate of cheating, levels of psychopathic traits did not influence the frequency of dishonesty. Higher psychopathy scores predicted decreased activity in the ACC during dishonest decision-making. Further analysis revealed that the ACC was functionally connected to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and that ACC activity mediated the relationship between psychopathic traits and reduced reaction times for dishonest behavior.

Journal Reference: Han K, Martinez D, Chapman SB, Krawczyk DC. Neural correlates of reduced depressive symptoms following cognitive training for chronic traumatic brain injury. Hum Brain Mapp. 2018;39:2955 #8211;2971. DOI: https://doi.org/10.1002/hbm.24052 Link: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hbm.24052 Abstract Depression is the most frequent comorbid psychiatric condition among individuals with traumatic brain injury (TBI). Yet, little is known about changes in the brain associated with reduced depressive symptoms following rehabilitation for TBI. We identified whether cognitive training alleviates comorbid depressive symptoms in chronic TBI ( gt;6 months post #8208;injury) as a secondary effect. Further, we elucidated neural correlates of alleviated depressive symptoms following cognitive training. A total of seventy #8208;nine individuals with chronic TBI (53 depressed and 26 non #8208;depressed individuals, measured using the Beck Depressive Inventory [BDI]), underwent either strategy #8208; or information #8208;based cognitive training in a small group for 8 weeks. We measured psychological functioning scores, cortical thickness, and resting #8208;state functional connectivity (rsFC) for these individuals before training, immediately post #8208;training, and 3 months post #8208;training. After confirming that changes in BDI scores were independent of training group affiliation, we identified that the depressive #8208;symptoms group showed reductions in BDI scores over time relative to the non #8208;depressed TBI controls (p  lt; .01). Within the depressive #8208;symptoms group, reduced BDI scores was associated with improvements in scores for post #8208;traumatic stress disorder, TBI symptom awareness, and functional status (p  lt; .00625), increases in cortical thickness in four regions within the right prefrontal cortex (pvertex  lt; .01, pcluster lt;.05), and decreases in rsFC with each of these four prefrontal regions (pvertex  lt; .01, pcluster  lt; .0125). Overall, these findings suggest that cognitive training can reduce depressive symptoms in TBI even when the training does not directly target psychiatric symptoms. Importantly, cortical thickness and brain connectivity may offer promising neuroimaging markers of training #8208;induced improvement in mental health status in TBI.</TEXT>

Genome-wide association studies have strongly and repeatedly linked risk for both of these neuropsychiatric diseases to a 100 kb interval in the third intron of the human calcium channel gene CACNA1C. However, the causative mutation is not yet known. We have identified a human-specific tandem repeat in this region that is composed of 30 bp units, often repeated hundreds of times. This large tandem repeat is unstable using standard polymerase chain reaction and bacterial cloning techniques, which may have resulted in its incorrect size in the human reference genome. The large 30-mer repeat region is polymorphic in both size and sequence in human populations. Particular sequence variants of the 30-mer are associated with risk status at several flanking single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the third intron of CACNA1C that have previously been linked to BD and SCZ. The tandem repeat arrays function as enhancers that increase reporter gene expression in a human neural progenitor cell line. Different human arrays vary in the magnitude of enhancer activity, and the 30-mer arrays associated with increased psychiatric disease risk status have decreased enhancer activity. Changes in the structure and sequence of these arrays likely contribute to changes in CACNA1C function during human evolution and may modulate neuropsychiatric disease risk in modern human populations.</TEXT>

Although psychological traits are known to impact sexual attitudes and behavior, sexuality- and personality-related traits have not been jointly investigated to assess their relevance for sexual functioning in couples. The aim of this study was to investigate how psychological traits of two partners influence women #8217;s and men #8217;s sexual function. Data from 964 couples, representative of the adult population in Germany, were analyzed. Sexual function was assessed with the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) and the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF). Sexuality-related traits were measured with the Sexual Excitation/Sexual Inhibition Inventory for Women and Men (SESII-W/M). Personality was measured with self-report and partner-rating versions of the Big Five Inventory (BFI). Sexual excitation was a positive and sexual inhibition was a negative predictor of sexual function in both genders. Women whose partners were sexually inhibited reported lower sexual function. Conscientious individuals reported better sexual function. Women whose partners were more conscientious also had better sexual function. Assessing partner-related factors may be helpful to identify predisposing and maintaining factors of sexual dysfunctions, especially in women.</TEXT>

Burkina Faso is an area with intense malaria transmission and highly pyrethroid-resistant vectors. We assessed the effectiveness of bednets containing permethrin, a pyrethroid, and pyriproxyfen, an insect growth regulator, versus permethrin-only (standard) LLINs against clinical malaria in children younger than 5 years in Banfora, Burkina Faso. Methods In this two-group, step-wedge, cluster-randomised, controlled, superiority trial, standard LLINs were incrementally replaced with LLINs treated with permethrin plus pyriproxyfen (PPF) in 40 rural clusters in Burkina Faso. In each cluster, 50 children (aged 6 months to 5 years) were followed up by passive case detection for clinical malaria. Cross-sectional surveys were done at the start and the end of the transmission seasons in 2014 and 2015. We did monthly collections from indoor light traps to estimate vector densities. Primary endpoints were the incidence of clinical malaria, measured by passive case detection, and the entomological inoculation rate. Analyses were adjusted for clustering and for month and health centre. This trial is registered as ISRCTN21853394. Findings 1980 children were enrolled in the cohort in 2014 and 2157 in 2015. At the end of the study, more than 99% of children slept under a bednet. The incidence of clinical malaria was 2 #183;0 episodes per child-year in the standard LLIN group and 1 #183;5 episodes per child-year in the PPF-treated LLIN group (incidence rate ratio 0 #183;88 [95% CI 0 #183;77 #8211;0 #183;99; p=0 #183;04]). The entomological inoculation rate was 85 (95% CI 63 #8211;108) infective bites per transmission season in the standard LLIN group versus 42 (32 #8211;52) infective bites per transmission season in the PPF-treated LLIN group (rate ratio 0 #183;49, 95% CI 0 #183;32 #8211;0 #183;66; p lt;0 #183;0001). Interpretation PPF-treated LLINs provide greater protection against clinical malaria than do standard LLINs and could be used as an alternative to standard LLINs in areas with intense transmission of Plasmodium falciparum malaria and highly pyrethroid-resistant vectors.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The title of the post is a copy and paste from the first, second and fifth paragraphs of the linked academic press release here :  gt; People in Nordic countries, North America, Australia, and New Zealand have the best spatial navigational abilities, according to a new study led by UCL and the University of East Anglia.  gt; Researchers assessed data from over half a million people in 57 countries who played a specially-designed mobile game, which has been developed to aid understanding into spatial navigation, a key indicator in Alzheimer #8217;s disease.  gt; And men performed better than women, but the gender gap narrowed in countries with greater gender equality, according to the study published today in Current Biology. Journal Reference: Antoine Coutrot, Ricardo Silva, Ed Manley, Will de Cothi, Saber Sami, V #233;ronique D. Bohbot, Jan M. Wiener, Christoph H #246;lscher, Ruth C. Dalton, Michael Hornberger, Hugo J. Spiers. Global Determinants of Navigation Ability. Current Biology, 2018; DOI: 10.1016/j.cub.2018.06.009 Link: https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(18)30771-1 Highlights We designed a mobile video game to test spatial ability in humans We tested more than 2.5 million people from every country in the world Spatial ability of the population of a country is correlated with economic wealth Gender inequality of a country is predictive of gender differences in navigation ability Summary Human spatial ability is modulated by a number of factors, including age [1, 2, 3] and gender [4, 5]. Although a few studies showed that culture influences cognitive strategies [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], the interaction between these factors has never been globally assessed as this requires testing millions of people of all ages across many different countries in the world. Since countries vary in their geographical and cultural properties, we predicted that these variations give rise to an organized spatial distribution of cognition at a planetary-wide scale. To test this hypothesis, we developed a mobile-app-based cognitive task, measuring non-verbal spatial navigation ability in more than 2.5 million people and sampling populations in every nation state. We focused on spatial navigation due to its universal requirement across cultures. Using a clustering approach, we find that navigation ability is clustered into five distinct, yet geographically related, groups of countries. Specifically, the economic wealth of a nation was predictive of the average navigation ability of its inhabitants, and gender inequality was predictive of the size of performance difference between males and females. Thus, cognitive abilities, at least for spatial navigation, are clustered according to economic wealth and gender inequalities globally, which has significant implications for cross-cultural studies and multi-center clinical trials using cognitive testing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Matthew Motta, Timothy Callaghan, Steven Sylvester, Knowing less but presuming more: Dunning-Kruger effects and the endorsement of anti-vaccine policy attitudes, Social Science  amp; Medicine, Volume 211, 2018, Pages 274-281, ISSN 0277-9536, DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2018.06.032. Link: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S027795361830340X Abstract: Objective Although the benefits of vaccines are widely recognized by medical experts, public opinion about vaccination policies is mixed. We analyze public opinion about vaccination policies to assess whether Dunning-Kruger effects can help to explain anti-vaccination policy attitudes. Rationale People low in autism awareness  #8211; that is, the knowledge of basic facts and dismissal of misinformation about autism  #8211; should be the most likely to think that they are better informed than medical experts about the causes of autism (a Dunning-Kruger effect). This  #8220;overconfidence #8221; should be associated with decreased support for mandatory vaccination policies and skepticism about the role that medical professionals play in the policymaking process. Method In an original survey of U.S. adults (N #8239;= #8239;1310), we modeled self-reported overconfidence as a function of responses to a knowledge test about the causes of autism, and the endorsement of misinformation about a link between vaccines and autism. We then modeled anti-vaccination policy support and attitudes toward the role that experts play in the policymaking process as a function of overconfidence and the autism awareness indicators while controlling for potential confounding factors. Results More than a third of respondents in our sample thought that they knew as much or more than doctors (36%) and scientists (34%) about the causes of autism. Our analysis indicates that this overconfidence is highest among those with low levels of knowledge about the causes of autism and those with high levels of misinformation endorsement. Further, our results suggest that this overconfidence is associated with opposition to mandatory vaccination policy. Overconfidence is also associated with increased support for the role that non-experts (e.g., celebrities) play in the policymaking process.

Sy, Hung Fu Tseng Pediatrics Aug 2018, e20180120; DOI: 10.1542/peds.2018-0120 Link: http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2018/08/09/peds.2018-0120 Abstract BACKGROUND: Increasing vaccination of pregnant women makes it important to assess safety events potentially linked to prenatal vaccination. This study investigates the association between prenatal tetanus, diphtheria, acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccination and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) risk in offspring. METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study of mother-child pairs with deliveries January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2014 at Kaiser Permanente Southern California hospitals. Maternal Tdap vaccination from pregnancy start to delivery date was obtained from electronic medical records. A diagnosis of ASD was obtained by using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth and Tenth Revision codes. Children were managed from birth to first ASD diagnosis, end of membership, or end of follow-up (June 30, 2017). Cox proportional hazards models estimated the unadjusted and adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for the association between maternal Tdap vaccination and ASD, with inverse probability of treatment weighting to adjust for confounding. RESULTS: Women vaccinated were more likely to be Asian American or Pacific Islander, be nulliparous, have a higher education, receive influenza vaccination prenatally, and give birth at term. ASD was diagnosed in 1341 (1.6%) children, and the incidence rate was 3.78 per 1000 person years in the Tdap exposed and 4.05 per 1000 person years in the unexposed group (HR: 0.98, 95% confidence interval: 0.88 #8211;1.09). The inverse probability of treatment weighting #8211;adjusted analyses revealed that prenatal Tdap vaccination was not associated with an increased ASD risk (HR: 0.85, 95% confidence interval: 0.77 #8211;0.95). CONCLUSIONS: Prenatal Tdap vaccination was not associated with an increased ASD risk. We support recommendations to vaccinate pregnant women to protect infants, who are at highest risk of death after pertussis infection.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The title of the post is a copy and paste from the first paragraph of the linked academic press release here :  gt; The use of benzodiazepines and related drugs (Z drugs) is associated with a modestly increased risk of Alzheimer #8217;s disease, according to a recent study from the University of Eastern Finland. Journal Reference: The risk of Alzheimer's disease associated with benzodiazepines and related drugs: A nested case-control study. Vesa Tapiainen, Heidi Taipale, Antti Tanskanen, Jari Tiihonen, Sirpa Hartikainen, Anna-Maija Tolppanen. Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica. 2018;138(2):91-100. doi: https://doi.org/10.1111/acps.12909. Link: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/acps.12909 Abstract Objective To assess the association between benzodiazepine and related drug (BZDR) use and risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) with cumulative consumption and duration of use based models. Method A nationwide nested case #8211;control study of all Finnish community #8208;dwelling persons who received clinically verified AD diagnosis in 2005 #8211;2011 (N = 70 719) and their matched controls (N = 282 862). AD diagnosis was based on DSM #8208;IV and NINCDS #8208;ADRDA criteria. BZDR purchases were extracted from the Prescription Register since 1995. The association between BZDR use and AD was assessed using conditional logistic regression with 5 #8208;year lag time between exposure and outcome. Results Benzodiazepine and related drug use was associated with modestly increased risk of AD (adjusted OR 1.06, 95% CI 1.04 #8211;1.08). A dose #8211;response relationship was observed with both cumulative consumption and duration. Adjustment for other psychotropics removed the cumulative dose #8211;response relationship by attenuating the ORs in the highest dose category. Conclusion Benzodiazepine and related drug use in general was associated with modestly increased risk of AD. No major differences were observed between different subcategories of BZDRs (i.e. benzodiazepines, Z drugs, short #8208;/medium #8208;acting or long #8208;acting BZDRs). As dose #8211;response relationship abolished after adjustment for other psychotropics, it is possible that the association may partially be due to antidepressants and/or antipsychotics, or concomitant use of these medications.</TEXT>

Journal Reference: Rose L. Szabady, Christopher Louissaint, Anneke Lubben, Bailu Xie, Shaun Reeksting, Christine Tuohy, Zachary Demma, Sage E. Foley, Christina S. Faherty, Alejandro Llanos-Chea, Andrew J. Olive, Randall J. Mrsny, Beth A. McCormick. Intestinal P-glycoprotein exports endocannabinoids to prevent inflammation and maintain homeostasis. Journal of Clinical Investigation, 2018; DOI: 10.1172/JCI96817 Link: https://www.jci.org/articles/view/96817 Abstract Neutrophil influx into the intestinal lumen is a critical response to infectious agents, but is also associated with severe intestinal damage observed in idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease. The chemoattractant hepoxilin A3, an eicosanoid secreted from intestinal epithelial cells by the apically restricted efflux pump multidrug resistance protein 2 (MRP2), mediates this neutrophil influx. Information about a possible counterbalance pathway that could signal the lack of or resolution of an apical inflammatory signal, however, has yet to be described. We now report a system with such hallmarks. Specifically, we identify endocannabinoids as the first known endogenous substrates of the apically restricted multidrug resistance transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and reveal a mechanism, which we believe is novel, for endocannabinoid secretion into the intestinal lumen. Knockdown or inhibition of P-gp reduced luminal secretion levels of N-acyl ethanolamine #8211;type endocannabinoids, which correlated with increased neutrophil transmigration in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, loss of CB2, the peripheral cannabinoid receptor, led to increased pathology and neutrophil influx in models of acute intestinal inflammation. These results define a key role for epithelial cells in balancing the constitutive secretion of antiinflammatory lipids with the stimulated secretion of proinflammatory lipids via surface efflux pumps in order to control neutrophil infiltration into the intestinal lumen and maintain homeostasis in the healthy intestine.</TEXT>

Journal Reference: Rachel R. Romeo, Joshua Segaran, Julia A. Leonard, Sydney T. Robinson, Martin R. West, Allyson P. Mackey, Anastasia Yendiki, Meredith L. Rowe, John D. E. Gabrieli. Language Exposure Relates to Structural Neural Connectivity in Childhood. The Journal of Neuroscience, 2018; 0484-18 DOI: 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0484-18.2018 Link: http://www.jneurosci.org/content/early/2018/08/13/JNEUROSCI.0484-18.2018 Abstract Neuroscience research has elucidated broad relationships between socioeconomic status (SES) and young children's brain structure, but there is little mechanistic knowledge about specific environmental factors that are associated with specific variation in brain structure. One environmental factor, early language exposure, predicts children's linguistic and cognitive skills and later academic achievement, but how language exposure relates to neuroanatomy is unknown. By measuring the real-world language exposure of young children (ages 4-6 years, 27 male/13 female), we confirmed the preregistered hypothesis that greater adult-child conversational experience, independent of SES and the sheer amount of adult speech, is related to stronger, more coherent white matter connectivity in the left arcuate and superior longitudinal fasciculi on average, and specifically near their anterior termination at Broca's area in left inferior frontal cortex. Fractional anisotropy of significant tract sub-regions mediated the relationship between conversational turns and children's language skills and indicated a neuroanatomical mechanism underlying the SES  #8220;language gap. #8221; Post-hoc whole-brain analyses revealed that language exposure was not related to any other white matter tracts, indicating the specificity of this relationship. Results suggest that the development of dorsal language tracts is environmentally influenced, specifically by early, dialogic interaction. Furthermore, these findings raise the possibility that early intervention programs aiming to ameliorate disadvantages in development due to family SES may focus on increasing children's conversational exposure in order to capitalize on the early neural plasticity underlying cognitive development. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Over the last decade, cognitive neuroscience has highlighted the detrimental impact of disadvantaged backgrounds on young children's brain structure. However, to intervene effectively, we must know which proximal aspects of the environmental aspects are most strongly related to neural development. The present study finds that young children's real-world language exposure, and specifically the amount of adult-child conversation, correlates with the strength of connectivity in the left hemisphere white matter pathway connecting two canonical language regions, independent of SES and the sheer volume of adult speech. These findings suggest that early intervention programs aiming to close the achievement gap may focus on increasing children's conversational exposure in order to capitalize on the early neural plasticity underlying cognitive development.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Journal reference: How role jugglers maintain relationships at home and at work: A gender comparison. ten Brummelhuis, Lieke L.,Greenhaus, Jeffrey H. Journal of Applied Psychology, Jul 23 , 2018, doi: 10.1037/apl0000340 Link: http://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fapl0000340 Abstract: We examined how demands and resources in a role relate to the quality of relationships in another role. In Study 1, 26 cohabiting dual-earner couples reported on five consecutive days about their work demands and work resources, emotional support they provided to the spouse, and relationship quality among family members. Dyadic data analysis revealed that husbands #8217; work demands were negatively related to family relationship quality through reduced emotional support provided to their wives. Wives #8217; work resources were positively related family relationship quality through enhanced emotional support provided to their husbands. In Study 2, we explored whether the same gender pattern existed in the home-to-work direction. Sixty-four coworker dyads reported on five days about their home demands and resources, emotional support provided to their coworker, and relationship quality among team members. For male employees, home demands were negatively related to team relationship quality through reduced emotional support they provided to their coworker. For female employees, home resources were positively related to team relationship quality through enhanced emotional support they provided to their coworker. The findings suggest that relative to men, women prevent role demands from reducing the support they provide in another role and use role resources to enhance the support they provide in another role, thereby strengthening relationship quality in that role.</TEXT>

Climatic and socioeconomic controls of future coastal flood risk in Europe.

We present a comprehensive analysis of future coastal flood risk (CFR) for Europe that separates the impacts of global warming and socioeconomic development. In the absence of further investments in coastal adaptation, the present expected annual damage (EAD) of  #8364;1.25 #8201;billion is projected to increase by two to three orders of magnitude by the end of the century, ranging between 93 and  #8364;961 #8201;billion. The current expected annual number of people exposed (EAPE) to coastal flooding of 102,000 is projected to reach 1.52 #8211;3.65 #8201;million by the end of the century. Climate change is the main driver of the future rise in coastal flood losses, with the importance of coastward migration, urbanization and rising asset values rapidly declining with time. To keep future coastal flood losses constant relative to the size of the economy, flood defence structures need to be installed or reinforced to withstand increases in ESLs that range from 0.5 to 2.5 m.</TEXT>

Abstract Background Transport mode choice has been associated with different health risks and benefits depending on which transport mode is used. We aimed to evaluate the association between different transport modes use and several health and social contact measures. Methods We based our analyses on the Physical Activity through Sustainable Transport Approaches (PASTA) longitudinal study, conducted over a period of two years in seven European cities. 8802 participants finished the baseline questionnaire, and 3567 answered the final questionnaire. Participants were 18 #8239;years of age or older (16 #8239;years of age or older in Zurich) and lived, worked and/or studied in one of the case-study cities. Associations between transport mode use and health/social contact measures were estimated using mixed-effects logistic regression models, linear regression models, and logistic regression models according to the data available. All the associations were assessed with single and multiple transport mode models. All models were adjusted for potential confounders. Results In multiple transport mode models, bicycle use was associated with good self-perceived health [OR (CI 95%) #8239;= #8239;1.07 (1.05, 1.08)], all the mental health measures [perceived stress: coef (CI 95%) #8239;= #8239; #8722;0.016 ( #8722;0.028,  #8722;0.004); mental health: coef (CI 95%) #8239;= #8239;0.11 (0.05, 0.18); vitality: coef (CI 95%) #8239;= #8239;0.14 (0.07, 0.22)], and with fewer feelings of loneliness [coef (CI 95%) #8239;= #8239; #8722;0.03 ( #8722;0.05,  #8722;0.01)]. Walking was associated with good self-perceived health [OR (CI 95%) #8239;= #8239;1.02 (1.00, 1.03)], higher vitality [coef (CI 95%) #8239;= #8239;0.14 (0.05, 0.23)], and more frequent contact with friends/family [OR (CI 95%) #8239;= #8239;1.03 (1.00, 1.05)]. Car use was associated with fewer feelings of loneliness [coef (CI 95%) #8239;= #8239; #8722;0.04 ( #8722;0.06,  #8722;0.02)]. The results for e-bike and public transport use were non-significant, and the results for motorbike use were inconclusive.

Compensation of hospital executives, especially at major nonprofit medical centers, and the  #8220;wage gap #8221; with physicians and clinical staff has been highlighted in the national news.

Methods We identified chief executive officer (CEO) compensation and chief financial officer (CFO) compensation at 22 major US nonprofit medical centers, which were selected from the US News  amp; World Report 2016-2017 Hospital Honor Roll list and four health systems with notable orthopaedic departments, using publicly available Internal Revenue Service 990 forms for the years 2005, 2010, and 2015. Trends in executive compensation over time were assessed using Pearson product-moment correlation tests. As institution-specific compensation data is not available, national mean compensation of orthopaedic surgeons, pediatricians, and registered nurses was used as a surrogate. We chose orthopaedic surgeons and pediatricians for analysis because they represent the two ends of the physician-compensation spectrum. US healthcare industry worker numbers and wages from 2005 to 2015 were obtained from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and used to calculate the national cost of healthcare wages. Healthcare utilization trends were assessed using data from the Agency for Healthcare Quality and Research, the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, and the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey. All data were adjusted for inflation based on 2015 Consumer Price Index. Results From 2005 to 2015, the mean major nonprofit medical center CEO compensation increased from USD 1.6  #177; 0.9 million to USD 3.1  #177; 1.7 million, or a 93% increase (R2 = 0.112; p = 0.009). The wage gap increased from 3:1 to 5:1 with orthopaedic surgeons, from 7:1 to 12:1 with pediatricians, and from 23:1 to 44:1 with registered nurses. We saw a similar wage-gap trend in CFO compensation. From 2005 to 2015, mean healthcare worker wages increased 8%. Management worker wages increased 14%, nonclinical worker wages increased 7%, and physician salaries increased 10%. The number of healthcare workers rose 20%, from 13 million to 15 million. Management workers accounted for 3% of this growth, nonclinical workers accounted for 27%, and physicians accounted for 5% of the growth. From 2005 to 2015, the national cost-burden of healthcare worker wages grew from USD 663 billion to USD 865 billion (a 30% increase). Nonclinical workers accounted for 27% of this growth, management workers accounted for 7%, and physicians accounted for 18%. In 2015, there were 10 nonclinical workers for every one physician. The cost of healthcare worker wages accounted for 27% of the growth in national healthcare expenditures. From 2005 to 2015, the number of inpatient stays decreased from 38 million to 36 million (a 5% decrease), the number of physician office visits increased from 964 million to 991 million (a 3% increase), and the number of emergency department visits increased from 115 million to 137 million (a 19% increase). Conclusions There is a fast-rising wage gap between the top executives of major nonprofit centers and physicians that reflects the substantial, and growing, cost of nonclinical worker wages to the US healthcare system. However, there does not appear to be a proportionate increase in healthcare utilization. These findings suggest a growing, substantial burden of nonclinical tasks in healthcare. Methods to reduce nonclinical work in healthcare may result in important cost-savings.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Journal Reference: Christoph Will, Kilin Shi, Sven Schellenberger, Tobias Steigleder, Fabian Michler, Jonas Fuchs, Robert Weigel, Christoph Ostgathe, Alexander Koelpin. Radar-Based Heart Sound Detection. Scientific Reports, 2018; 8 (1) DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-29984-5 Link: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-29984-5 Abstract This paper introduces heart sound detection by radar systems, which enables touch-free and continuous monitoring of heart sounds. The proposed measurement principle entails two enhancements in modern vital sign monitoring. First, common touch-based auscultation with a phonocardiograph can be simplified by using biomedical radar systems. Second, detecting heart sounds offers a further feasibility in radar-based heartbeat monitoring. To analyse the performance of the proposed measurement principle, 9930 seconds of eleven persons-under-tests #8217; vital signs were acquired and stored in a database using multiple, synchronised sensors: a continuous wave radar system, a phonocardiograph (PCG), an electrocardiograph (ECG), and a temperature-based respiration sensor. A hidden semi-Markov model is utilised to detect the heart sounds in the phonocardiograph and radar data and additionally, an advanced template matching (ATM) algorithm is used for state-of-the-art radar-based heartbeat detection. The feasibility of the proposed measurement principle is shown by a morphology analysis between the data acquired by radar and PCG for the dominant heart sounds S1 and S2: The correlation is 82.97 #8201; #177; #8201;11.15% for 5274 used occurrences of S1 and 80.72 #8201; #177; #8201;12.16% for 5277 used occurrences of S2. The performance of the proposed detection method is evaluated by comparing the F-scores for radar and PCG-based heart sound detection with ECG as reference: Achieving an F1 value of 92.22 #8201; #177; #8201;2.07%, the radar system approximates the score of 94.15 #8201; #177; #8201;1.61% for the PCG. The accuracy regarding the detection timing of heartbeat occurrences is analysed by means of the root-mean-square error: In comparison to the ATM algorithm (144.9 ms) and the PCG-based variant (59.4 ms), the proposed method has the lowest error value (44.2 ms). Based on these results, utilising the detected heart sounds considerably improves radar-based heartbeat monitoring, while the achieved performance is also competitive to phonocardiography.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The title of the post is a copy and paste from the first, second and seventh paragraphs of the linked academic press release here :  gt; In 1988, the German psychologist and his colleagues published research that appeared to show that if your mouth is forced into a smile, you become a bit happier, and if it #8217;s forced into a frown, you become a bit sadder.  gt; This basic idea, that our facial expressions can feed back into our psychological state and behavior, goes back at least as far as Darwin and William James, but  #8220;facial feedback #8221;, as it is known, had never been demonstrated in such an elegant and rigorous-seeming manner.  gt; In other words, it could be that facial feedback is real, but if you feel like you #8217;re being observed, the effect is stymied. Journal reference: Noah, T., Schul, Y.,  amp; Mayo, R. (2018). When both the original study and its failed replication are correct: Feeling observed eliminates the facial-feedback effect. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 114(5), 657-664 Doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/pspa0000121 Link: http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2018-16714-001 Abstract This article suggests a theoretically driven explanation for a replication failure of one of the basic findings in psychology: the facial-feedback effect. According to the facial-feedback hypothesis, the facial activity associated with particular emotional expressions can influence people #8217;s affective experiences. Recently, a replication attempt of this effect in 17 laboratories around the world failed to find any support for the effect. We hypothesize that the reason for the failure of replication is that the replication protocol deviated from that of the original experiment in a critical factor. In all of the replication studies, participants were alerted that they would be monitored by a video camera, whereas the participants in the original study were not monitored, observed, or recorded. Previous findings indicate that feeling monitored or observed reduces reliance on internal cues in making judgments. Therefore, we hypothesize that recording the participants in the replication experiments reduced their reliance on the facial-feedback. To test the hypothesis, we replicated the facial-feedback experiment in 2 conditions: one with a video-camera and one without it. The results revealed a significant facial-feedback effect in the absence of a camera, which was eliminated in the camera #8217;s presence. These findings suggest that minute differences in the experimental protocol might lead to theoretically meaningful changes in the outcomes. In our view, the theoretical and methodological approach advocated by our study changes failed replications from being the  #8220;end of the road #8221; regarding entire fields of study into a new road for growth regarding our understanding of human nature.</TEXT>

Restoration of vision after de novo genesis of rod photoreceptors in mammalian retinas. Nature, 2018; DOI: 10.1038/s41586-018-0425-3 Link: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0425-3 Abstract In zebrafish, M #252;ller glia (MG) are a source of retinal stem cells that can replenish damaged retinal neurons and restore vision1. In mammals, however, MG do not spontaneously re-enter the cell cycle to generate a population of stem or progenitor cells that differentiate into retinal neurons. Nevertheless, the regenerative machinery may exist in the mammalian retina, as retinal injury can stimulate MG proliferation followed by limited neurogenesis2,3,4,5,6,7. Therefore, there is still a fundamental question regarding whether MG-derived regeneration can be exploited to restore vision in mammalian retinas. Gene transfer of  #946;-catenin stimulates MG proliferation in the absence of injury in mouse retinas8. Here we report that following gene transfer of  #946;-catenin, cell-cycle-reactivated MG can be reprogrammed to generate rod photoreceptors by subsequent gene transfer of transcription factors essential for rod cell fate specification and determination. MG-derived rods restored visual responses in Gnat1rd17Gnat2cpfl3 double mutant mice, a model of congenital blindness9,10, throughout the visual pathway from the retina to the primary visual cortex. Together, our results provide evidence of vision restoration after de novo MG-derived genesis of rod photoreceptors in mammalian retinas.</TEXT>

Cellular senescence, leading to tissue dysfunction, may contribute to these consequences of aging, but whether senescence can directly drive age-related pathology and be therapeutically targeted is still unclear. Here we demonstrate that transplanting relatively small numbers of senescent cells into young mice is sufficient to cause persistent physical dysfunction, as well as to spread cellular senescence to host tissues. Transplanting even fewer senescent cells had the same effect in older recipients and was accompanied by reduced survival, indicating the potency of senescent cells in shortening health- and lifespan. The senolytic cocktail, dasatinib plus quercetin, which causes selective elimination of senescent cells, decreased the number of naturally occurring senescent cells and their secretion of frailty-related proinflammatory cytokines in explants of human adipose tissue. Moreover, intermittent oral administration of senolytics to both senescent cell #8211;transplanted young mice and naturally aged mice alleviated physical dysfunction and increased post-treatment survival by 36% while reducing mortality hazard to 65%. Our study provides proof-of-concept evidence that senescent cells can cause physical dysfunction and decreased survival even in young mice, while senolytics can enhance remaining health- and lifespan in old mice.</TEXT>

Methods To investigate increased gut permeability (a  #8220;leaky gut #8221;) as one potential mechanistic pathway from marital distress and depression to heightened inflammation, this secondary analysis of a double-blind, randomized crossover study examined serial assessments of two endotoxin biomarkers, LPS-binding protein (LBP) and soluble CD14 (sCD14), as well as C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF- #945;) during two separate 9.5 #8239;h visits.

Additionally, the combination of more hostile marital interactions with a mood disorder history was associated with higher LBP/sCD14 ratios. Higher LBP and LBP/sCD14 were associated with greater CRP production; for example, only 21% of low LBP participants (lowest quartile) had average CRP across the day  gt; 3, compared to 79% of those in the highest quartile.

Journal Reference: Weyandt, L.L.; White, T.L.; Gudmundsdottir, B.G.; Nitenson, A.Z.; Rathkey, E.S.; De Leon, K.A.; Bjorn, S.A.

DOI: https://doi.org/10.3390/pharmacy6030058 Link: http://www.mdpi.com/2226-4787/6/3/58 Abstract Prescription stimulant medications are considered a safe and long-term effective treatment for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Studies support that stimulants enhance attention, memory, self-regulation and executive function in individuals with ADHD. Recent research, however, has found that many college students without ADHD report misusing prescription stimulants, primarily to enhance their cognitive abilities. This practice raises the question whether stimulants actually enhance cognitive functioning in college students without ADHD. We investigated the effects of mixed-salts amphetamine (i.e., Adderall, 30 mg) on cognitive, autonomic and emotional functioning in a pilot sample of healthy college students without ADHD (n = 13), using a double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subjects design. The present study was the first to explore cognitive effects in conjunction with mood, autonomic effects, and self-perceptions of cognitive enhancement. Results revealed that Adderall had minimal, but mixed, effects on cognitive processes relevant to neurocognitive enhancement (small effects), and substantial effects on autonomic responses, subjective drug experiences, and positive states of activated emotion (large effects). Overall, the present findings indicate dissociation between the effects of Adderall on activation and neurocognition, and more importantly, contrary to common belief, Adderall had little impact on neurocognitive performance in healthy college students. Given the pilot design of the study and small sample size these findings should be interpreted cautiously. The results have implications for future studies and the education of healthy college students and adults who commonly use Adderall to enhance neurocognition.</TEXT>

Link: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306453018300246)l Abstract: Testosterone and cortisol have both been implicated in human parenting behavior. We investigated the relations between observed quality of caregiving during parent-child interactions and pre- and postnatal testosterone and cortisol levels, in both mothers (N #8239;= #8239;88) and fathers (N #8239;= #8239;57). Testosterone and cortisol were measured before and after interaction with an infant simulator (prenatal) and with their own child (postnatal) to index basal levels as well as steroid reactivity to the interaction. Our findings are that in fathers, interactions between cortisol and testosterone are related to quality of caregiving both pre- and postnatally. Prenatally there was a stronger negative relation between T and quality of caregiving in fathers with lower cortisol levels, and postnatally there was a stronger negative relation between cortisol and quality of caregiving in fathers high in testosterone levels. Furthermore, prenatal cortisol levels were related to paternal quality of caregiving during interaction with their own child. In mothers, no associations between quality of caregiving and our endocrine measures were observed. We interpret our findings in the context of hyperreactive physiological responses observed in parents at risk for insensitive caregiving, and in light of the dual-hormone hypothesis. The current findings contribute to the growing literature on the endocrine antecedents of human caregiving behavior.</TEXT>

Journal reference: Prior Arrest, Substance Use, Mental Disorder, and Intent-Specific Firearm Injury Brianna M. Mills, PhDcorrespondenceEmail the author PhD Brianna M. Mills, Paula S. Nurius, PhD, MSW, MA, Ross L. Matsueda, PhD, Frederick P. Rivara, MD, MPH, Ali Rowhani-Rahbar, MD, MPH, PhD American Journal of Preventive Medicine 2018 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amepre.2018.04.041 Link: https://www.ajpmonline.org/article/S0749-3797(18)31829-4/fulltext Abstract: Introduction Substance use, mental disorders, and arrest are markers of increased firearm injury risk. It is unclear how these markers vary by intent. Examining these interrelated factors together can clarify their associations with assault-related, self-inflicted, unintentional, and legal intervention firearm injuries, informing intent-specific interventions. Methods In 2017 #8211;2018, 2-year diagnosis and arrest histories of intent-specific firearm injury cases were compared with those of unintentionally injured motor vehicle collision passenger controls. Fatal and nonfatal firearm and motor vehicle collision injury records in Seattle (2010 #8211;2014) were linked to statewide hospitalization and arrest records. Multinomial logistic regression models compared odds of prior arrest, substance use, and mental disorder diagnoses among intent-specific firearm injury cases relative to controls, adjusting for age, race, and gender. Results A total of 763 cases and 335 controls were identified. Unintentional and self-inflicted cases did not differ significantly from controls in arrest history. Legal intervention cases resembled assault-related cases in their arrest history, and self-inflicted cases in their hospitalization history. The legal intervention cases were more likely than controls to have a prior felony arrest (OR=7.72, 95% CI=2.63, 20.97), and diagnoses involving alcohol (OR=4.06, 95% CI=1.04, 15.84); cannabis (OR=11.00, 95% CI=1.01, 119.36); depression/anxiety (OR=7.22, 95% CI=1.89, 27.67); psychosis (OR=6.99, 95% CI=1.35, 36.24); or conduct disorder (OR=22.01, 95% CI=1.44, 335.93). Conclusions Individuals with intent-specific firearm injuries have distinct patterns of prior substance use, mental disorder, and arrest. Many injuries occur after a series of encounters with institutions meant to help individuals during crises that can fail to provide longer-term solutions.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Journal reference: Atomic iron and titanium in the atmosphere of the exoplanet KELT-9b H. Jens Hoeijmakers, David Ehrenreich, [ #8230;]Luca Di Fabrizio Nature (2018) DOI: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-018-0401-y Link: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0401-y Abstract To constrain the formation history of an exoplanet, we need to know its chemical composition1,2,3. With an equilibrium temperature of about 4,050 #8201;kelvin4, the exoplanet KELT-9b (also known as HD 195689b) is an archetype of the class of ultrahot Jupiters that straddle the transition between stars and gas-giant exoplanets and are therefore useful for studying atmospheric chemistry. At these high temperatures, iron and several other transition metals are not sequestered in molecules or cloud particles and exist solely in their atomic forms5. However, despite being the most abundant transition metal in nature, iron has not hitherto been detected directly in an exoplanet because it is highly refractory. The high temperatures of KELT-9b imply that its atmosphere is a tightly constrained chemical system that is expected to be nearly in chemical equilibrium5 and cloud-free6,7, and it has been predicted that spectral lines of iron should be detectable in the visible range of wavelengths5. Here we report observations of neutral and singly ionized atomic iron (Fe and Fe+) and singly ionized atomic titanium (Ti+) in the atmosphere of KELT-9b. We identify these species using cross-correlation analysis8 of high-resolution spectra obtained as the exoplanet passed in front of its host star. Similar detections of metals in other ultrahot Jupiters will provide constraints for planetary formation theories.</TEXT>

To date, few studies have investigated prenatal exposure to toxins and risk of autism by using maternal biomarkers of exposure. Persistent organic pollutants are lipophilic halogenated organic compounds and include the insecticide dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), as well as its metabolite p,p #8242;-dichlorodiphenyl dichloroethylene (p,p #8242;-DDE), and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). The objective of this study was to test whether elevated maternal levels of persistent organic pollutants are associated with autism among offspring. Method: The investigation was derived from the Finnish Prenatal Study of Autism, a national birth cohort study based on a nested case-control design. Cases of autism among children born between 1987 and 2005 were ascertained by national registry linkages. In cases of childhood autism and matched control subjects (778 matched case-control pairs), maternal serum specimens from early pregnancy were assayed for levels of p,p #8242;-DDE and total levels of PCBs. Results: The odds of autism among offspring were significantly increased with maternal p,p #8242;-DDE levels that were in the highest 75th percentile, with adjustment for maternal age, parity, and history of psychiatric disorders (odds ratio=1.32, 95% CI=1.02, 1.71). The odds of autism with intellectual disability were increased by greater than twofold with maternal p,p #8242;-DDE levels above this threshold (odds ratio=2.21, 95% CI=1.32, 3.69). There was no association between total levels of maternal PCBs and autism. Conclusions: These findings provide the first biomarker-based evidence that maternal exposure to insecticides is associated with autism among offspring. Although further research is necessary to replicate this finding, this study has implications for the prevention of autism and may provide a better understanding of its pathogenesis.</TEXT>

The odds of autism with intellectual disability were increased by greater than twofold with maternal p,p #8242;-DDE levels above this threshold (odds ratio=2.21, 95% CI=1.32, 3.69). There was no association between total levels of maternal PCBs and autism. Conclusions: These findings provide the first biomarker-based evidence that maternal exposure to insecticides is associated with autism among offspring. Although further research is necessary to replicate this finding, this study has implications for the prevention of autism and may provide a better understanding of its pathogenesis.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The title of the post is a copy and paste from the first paragraph of the linked academic press release here :  gt; In a series of studies, social psychologists show that educational tracking - grouping students based on their achievement levels - encourages evaluators to artificially create social class inequalities. Three studies reveal that evaluators consider a lower track more suitable for a low socioeconomic status (SES) pupil and a higher track more suitable for a high-SES pupil, even when school achievement was identical. The results appear in the journal Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, published by the Society for Personality and Social Psychology. Journal Reference: Anatolia Batruch, Fr #233;d #233;rique Autin, Fabienne Bataillard, Fabrizio Butera. School Selection and the Social Class Divide: How Tracking Contributes to the Reproduction of Inequalities. Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 2018; 014616721879180 DOI: 10.1177/0146167218791804 Link: http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0146167218791804 Abstract Selection practices in education, such as tracking, may represent a structural obstacle that contributes to the social class achievement gap. We hypothesized that school #8217;s function of selection leads evaluators to reproduce social inequalities in tracking decisions, even when performance is equal. In two studies, participants (students playing the role of teachers, N = 99, or preservice and in-service teachers, N = 70) decided which school track was suitable for a pupil whose socioeconomic status (SES) was manipulated. Although pupils #8217; achievement was identical, participants considered a lower track more suitable for lower SES than higher SES pupils, and the higher track more suitable for higher SES than lower SES pupils. A third study (N = 160) revealed that when the selection function of school was salient, rather than its educational function, the gap in tracking between social classes was larger. The selection function of tracking appears to encourage evaluators to artificially create social class inequalities.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Preprint reference: Evidence for Superconductivity at Ambient Temperature and Pressure in Nanostructures Dev Kumar Thapa, Anshu Pandey (Submitted on 23 Jul 2018)  gt; Despite being a low temperature phenomenon till date, superconductivity has found numerous applications in diverse fields of medicine, science and engineering. The great scientific interest in the phenomenon as well as its practical utility has motivated extensive efforts to discover and understand new superconductors. We report the observation of superconductivity at ambient temperature and pressure conditions in films and pellets of a nanostructured material that is composed of silver particles embedded into a gold matrix. Specifically, we observe that upon cooling below 236 K at ambient pressures, the resistance of sample films drops below 10-4 Ohm, being limited by instrument sensitivity. Further, below the transition temperature, samples become strongly diamagnetic, with volume susceptibilities as low as -0.056. We further describe methods to tune the transition to temperatures higher than room temperature.
