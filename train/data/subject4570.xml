    <TITLE>FYI Swing Left is a scam</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-05-05 22:23:00</DATE>
    <TEXT>There's [a link](https://www.reddit.com/r/esist/comments/69eda3/700000_raised_to_unseat_republicans_who_voted_for/) on the front page right now bragging about Swing Left raising several hundred thousand to fight AHCA supporters. Don't donate to their "District Nominee Funds". It's a variation of a well-known scam, mostly seen on the right, but increasingly among Democratic-aligned groups, to come up with PACs and committees with generic names like "End Citizens United" or ["National Pro-Life Committee"](http://www.liveaction.org/news/new-phone-scam-targets-pro-lifers-with-fake-donation-request/). These groups are supposedly created to do electoral work and/or advocacy, but the scam is designed to funnel massive amounts of money back to the scammers. Here's a [great Politico writeup](http://www.politico.com/story/2016/08/donald-trump-fundraiser-hawes-227486 ) of how a scam PAC duped Trump supporters out of millions of dollars. Here's how the scam works: 1. File FEC paperwork to create a PAC or other type of committee 2. Buy or rent an email list of online donors, and send start sending these people emails about how they need to fight back against X issue RIGHT NOW by donating $10, which will be triple-matched, and #resist. Raise hundreds of thousands, or sometimes millions of dollars this way. 3. Now, you're sitting on a bunch of money that you were supposed to use for electoral purposes, and you need to launder it to yourself. First, pay yourself and your friends a six-figure salary out of PAC funds for the hard, hard work of running the PAC (i.e. drafting the email blast) 3a. Then, set up a fundraising consulting company that you own, and pay yourself a few million dollars for "fundraising consulting". 3b. Usually, at this point, you've laundered all the money. But sometimes, you duped donors [so successfully that there's money left over, and you're being scrutinized.](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/end-citizens-united-pac-campaign-finance-reform_us_570e5308e4b0ffa5937da409). So, set up a media buying firm. Take 10 minutes on Windows Movie Maker to make a bunch of trashy, ineffective ads with stock footage. Then, start running ads on cable, or hell, even Youtube. Make sure to take a 15% agency commission and a few hundred grand for media production costs. Oh, and since you're a Super PAC, you're paying twice what the candidates are paying for the same TV time. **Swing Left** Like I said, Swing Left is a variant of this scam. They've set up a bunch of ["District Nominee funds"](https://swingleft.org/district-funds) and they take [10% of your donation amount](https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/swing-AL-02-left), unless you email them specifically and ask that the 10% go directly to the candidate too. This "email us to change the allocation" thing is odd, since ActBlue allows committees to set up pages that split donations between multiple entities (such as between a candidate and a PAC). But they know most people won't bother emailing, which is why they've set it up that way. Swing Left is hoping that they raise several million dollars over the next couple of years, and they can pay themselves six or even seven figure salaries out of their 10% cut. What's their add-value for that 10%, which will inevitably total millions of dollars? That they create ActBlue fundraising pages. That's literally just it. They spent 1 minute each setting up an ActBlue page for each swing congressional district, and they have a pretty website. That's not worth siphoning millions of dollars from House candidates next cycle. Between propping up grifters like Louise Mensch, and sending money to scam groups like Swing Left... Democrats are dangerously close to fucking this up.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>lol jk. They want to give insurance companies ~$1400 per person to reduce their premiums by 14%. This is surely what Americans have been clamoring for all along. Still tens of millions of uninsured, still nothing to address long-term growth in out-of-pocket costs, still shit https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/healthcare/news/2017/06/29/435208/bipartisan-legislation-lower-premiums-stabilize-insurance-markets/ Edit: I'm fucking dying here, folks. It turns out the Senate Republican bill already includes a reinsurance fund for insurers which is....$15 billion for each of the next 2 years- which is *exactly* the same as the CAP proposal. Horseshoe theory confirmed. Pack it up, everyone, we're done here. Mitch McConnell and CAP came to the same healthcare proposal independently. https://twitter.com/sahilkapur/status/880441260670103553</TEXT>

    <TEXT>yeah that's the thing. these guys have broadly ideological left sympathies but when a real Democrat^TM comes along they'll tell everyone to rally behind them. that's why you'll never see these guys criticizing Obama for not halting bank foreclosures or trying to cut social security with john boehner, or hrc for the network of bajillionaire donors she cultivated and for giving no real shit about the poor. When Obama does deportations just ignore it. When Trump does them he's an inhumane monster who must be resisted. something something personality cult</TEXT>

You've made the hard choice between what was right, and what was easy, and you should feel really proud of yourself for that. What they're hoping is that this social pressure will force you to fall in line quickly,because they can't keep this up forever. So, it's important to stay strong and true to your beliefs. Also, know that you aren't alone and there are groups of many people who can probably sympathize with your situation, both in person and online \(look into JVP and IfNotNow\) because this is a pretty common cleavage between the older generation and the younger generation</TEXT>

There really isn't a single issue in her questionnaire where you see liberal hand-wringing.

    <TEXT>They are paid too much, even though that's not exactly what she said, and even though she's walked that back. So are NYC cops. Cuomo has made a nice corrupt deal with the TWU and LIUNA that spikes transit costs for the working class while developers and a handful of union members rake it in. The base pay rate for LIUNA 147 is $111 per hour, which quadruples to more than **$400 per hour** during weekend overtime, which, in practice, is when a lot of the work happens. That money mostly comes from fare increases on poor people. NYC's transit system is \*\*absolutely\*\* an example of the means of production extracting massive rents from the vast majority of working families to benefit a select group of crony capitalists and politically connected people who happen to be in labor. **Bottom line: When one class of laborer can't even scrape together $15 an hour, and another class of mostly white, male, politically connected worker is making $400+ an hour off the backs of regressive taxes on those  lt;$15/hr workers, that itself is a source of social inequality** [https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/28/nyregion/new-york-subway-construction-costs.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/28/nyregion/new-york-subway-construction-costs.html)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Of course she's "using" DSA for its ground game in NYC. There's literally no other benefit to being endorsed by NYC DSA. It's the same reason why Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez joined DSA at the same time she asked for the endorsement. To quote David Duhalde, as materialists, we need to remember the important question not if a politician genuinely adopts our beliefs (ultimately, only they know the sincerity) but what social forces push them to and why. There's no other candidate who has been out there shouting that ICE is a terrorist organization, who is even broaching the subject of reparations, etc. etc. If she wins, it's a huge win for the left.</TEXT>

That is to say, leftists candidates are not always going to be able to count on the support of labor leaders in their primaries (as Bernie Sanders found out the hard way!)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Posted this elsewhere, but looking at how she started, it seems clear to me that she's not out for the office first. Why? She ran a protest candidacy in 2014 in a campaign even she knew she couldn't win, to highlight issues that matter. And did surprisingly well, and realized that she might have an actual future in politics. Seems like that's all that is happening here. Clearly, she's a true believer. You don't endorse Crowley's challenger, or go up against Cuomo, if you aren't. Anyone who was really intent on getting into elected office would be sucking up to all these people all the time. The fact that she hasn't done so, that she hasn't quieted her stances on public corruption or closing the LLC loophole or any of these other issues is a huge positive asset.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>2014 was obviously a protest candidacy that everyone knew she would lose. The fact that she got a third of the vote with having no money and no institutional support was impressive. In 2016, she ran two points ahead of the top of the ticket, while most challengers ran behind the ticket (as is typical). I think this is the right race because of her focus on public corruption specifically- lot of work to be done here now that Preet is no longer around</TEXT>

    <TEXT>On the other hand, the benefit of this, from a materialist perspective, is that if you want to see more material gains for working people and more power for the left, the best offices to win are executive positions. Electing AOC was great, but until we elect 20 or 200 more of her, the center still holds. Cuomo has shown the enormous power that the executive branch wields in NY (and this is structural, not Cuomo specific - NY has executive budgeting, for example). Nixon alone can do quite a lot of good things for 20 million people.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>AOC joined DSA when she sought their endorsement. \ gt; She has enough money to just finance and hire her own people I mean, Cuomo has $30 million and labor leadership behind him. She has financed and hired some of her own people, but it won't be enough. \ gt; but it's basically exchanging labor for nothing in return (not even a little accountability) I mean, the exchange is massive gains for working people versus Cuomo. And probably DSA picks up some new members. And if she wins, DSA probably picks up a lot of new members. \ gt; this will force a ton of people who don't even like her to campaign for her. Uh, what DSA meetings have you been to where people are forced to campaign for candidates they don't like? This complaint in particular seems very unrealistic</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Also, she: 1. Was the first-ever national director of the Sunlight Foundation, the top anti-corruption civil society organization at the time (she made it hat) 2. Has done seminal work in the history of corruption and the law in the United States, to the point where her work was cited in the dissent to the Citizens United case in the Supreme Court 3. Has been a co-plaintiff and key lawyer in CREW's anti-corruption lawsuits against Trump - a legal strategy that has been recently vindicated by the courts, by the way Moreover, just look at the way she's funding her campaign. All small individual donors, no anonymous LLCs and no real estate money. In a state where LLCs can write six figure checks to political candidates, it takes quite a bit of willpower to abstain from that to maintain your prosecutorial independence. She's done so, and she's the only candidate in the race doing so. She's serious about fighting corruption, even if that puts her at a political disadvantage. That kind of integrity is golden, especially in the swamp of Albany.</TEXT>
