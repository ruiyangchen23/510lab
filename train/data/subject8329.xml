    <TITLE>ELI5: How do bits and bytes turn into a calculator?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2015-03-18 02:09:30</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've seen other posts that start discussing programming languages and whatnot; I understand this, but I'm confused on the simplest level. I chose a calculator because that's simpler than a computer, though I could well have chosen the microcontroller on a microwave, or a hundred other things we use daily. What exactly is a digital firing of zeroes and ones? How do we control this to do what we want, like represent the number 8 on a calculator or respond when we click a button? Thanks!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Looking for a liberal church</TITLE>
    <DATE>2015-10-12 09:55:07</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hey Edmonton! I moved here recently and I'm looking for a liberal, open-minded church. Back home after years of searching I found a church that really invites debate and challenges traditional church thinking, that embraces people of all sexual orientations, evokes an amazing community atmosphere, and always leaves me thinking deeply about social and religious issues. I am Christian, but I actually know several atheists who attend the church religiously because of the fresh perspective it provides and the awesome discussions it provokes. Now that I'll be in Edmonton for a while, I'm searching for a church that's at least close to that. I know united churches are supposed to be more liberal-leaning, but I tried one of the united churches here and it was...interesting. The congregation was like all over 70 and they sang Jesus loves me and the pastor sounded spiritual/hippie like - which is totally cool if you're into that, I'm just looking for a more structured/intellectual take. Maybe it was just that particular church. I know it's a lot to match up to, and reddit you aren't known for being religious. But you are known for being liberal. So if any of you go to church, tell me about :) Thanks! Edit: Thanks for all the responses guys - that's super helpful and I will definitely check a few of these out!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm posting this because I really believe Sanders best embodies the virtues of Christ - as someone with an honest message, who sticks up for the least of these and has acted with consistent integrity for decades. I think Jim here, an evangelical Christian pastor, [really makes a strong case for voting for Sanders from a Christian perspective](https://www.reddit.com/r/SandersForPresident/comments/3l4khz/transcript_of_biblical_argument_for_bernie_by_jim/). I know you will not all agree, and I invite you to dialogue in the comments. If you feel compelled to Bernie Sanders and what he stands for, I encourage to join us at r/ChristiansforSanders. I think for those of you looking from a Christian perspective, who are interested in Sanders, it's important to have a community of support and dialogue.</TEXT>

And yet, most folks would think of Trump as charismatic and I can't think of someone more opposite in style or appearance. We could take the dictionary definition - "exercising a compelling charm that inspires devotion in others" - but then Sanders certainly has a charm to him, and definitely inspires devotion, but most don't consider him charismatic. So what, to you, makes a politician charismatic?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>What do you think of these interesting demographic trends in the GW Battleground General Election poll? Some atypical results on both sides (see comments for details)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-05-01 22:30:21</DATE>
    <TEXT>This poll provides a wealth of statistics on how demograpraphics on viewpoints affect candidate polling. The poll compares each candidate in a one on one matchup, and [on page 135](https://mediarelations.gwu.edu/sites/mediarelations.gwu.edu/files/GWBattlegroundPoll58-crosstabs.pdf) we see Clinton vs Trump. What I found fascinating is that Clinton actually leads Trump 45 to 36 in Texas, while Trump leads Clinton 46 to 45 in the rest of the country (that is, all states that are not Texas, New York, California, or Florida. Clinton holds a solid 51 to 38 lead in the swing state of Florida. Of course the sample size is small for individual states (56 for Florida and 63 for Texas) so we should take those trends with a grain of salt, but it's interesting nonetheless. Thoughts on this or other trends in the survey?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Philippines election discussion thread - Duterte wins</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-05-10 00:45:55</DATE>
    <TEXT>Populist candidate Rodrigo Duterte, hailed as the Filipino Donald Trump, has [just won the presidency](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-36244456) in the Philippines. He has promised to crack down hard on drug traffickers - saying things like they better get lots of coffins ready - and has made many controversial/misogynist statements. His supporters claim he is not bound to the immoral establishment that have ruled the country for so many years, and hail his positive attitude towards the LGBT community and environmental protection. However, he has been very abrupt with critics and taken a my way or the highway attitude with foreign leaders. The vice presidency race (they get separately elected) is equally interesting, with Maria Robredo neck and neck with Ferdinand Marcos Jr. If that last name sounds familiar, it is because he is son to the late Philippines dictator. What do you think this election means for the Philippines and for the rest of the world? Do you think Duterte's election will lead to much needed reforms, devolve into corruption, or prove ineffective? Will the election impact other election campaigns?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>With polls showing a close race and the vote exactly two weeks away, there's been lots of talk about the economic repercussions of a Brexit. But opinions on Britain leaving the EU are correlated strongly to political affiliation and location. Those in Scotland and Northern Ireland mostly oppose a Brexit, while those in England are more likely than the rest to support it. Despits David Cameron's campaigning against Brexit, most Conservatives support leaving the EU, while most Labours want to stay in. What effect would an in or out vote have on each party's support, and on the Scottish independence movement or other political movements within the UK?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>ELI5: Why have church attendance rates spiked amongst Generation Z (having more than doubled from Millennials at the same age)?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-06-25 22:45:16</DATE>
    <TEXT>A 2016 U.S. study found that church attendance during young adulthood was 41% among Generation Z, compared with 18 percent for Millennials at the same ages. Gen Z is usually considered those born in the mid 1990s onwards, whereas millennials are those born from the early to mid 80s to the mid 90s. I apologize for the paywall but [this](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/dap.30174/abstract) is the study I'm referencing. As a millennials myself, I always thought all signs pointed to church rates declining and atheism on the rise amongst young people, and I'm surprised and very curious about this trend. I understand this is an American study and part of the trend might have to do with changing demographics but I wonder if someone can provide more insight into the underlying causes of this shift.</TEXT>

How is Eagle viewed amongst the British people and Labour party members, and does she pose a real threat to Corbyn in the impending leadership contest?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Seeing Obama's recent visit to Canada and the strong friendship, or "bromance" as the media puts it, between Trudeau and Obama, I was wondering what other historical examples exist of two leaders being very friendly on a personal basis. I know examples of the opposite - JFK and Diefenbaker couldn't stand each other, for instance, but what other country leaders either at present or in the past have been known to get along really well?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Trump has received a lot of attention for his recent campaign comments regarding the second amendment. What will be the implications for his campaign?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-08-10 01:19:19</DATE>
    <TEXT>Trump received a lot of backlash for his statements regarding the Khan family and this hurt him a lot in the polls, with some Republican party members coming out against him. Yesterday, Trump sought to take a different turn with a measured speech on economic policy. However, today that attention has once again turned away from Trump's policy after he made the following statement: ["Hillary wants to abolish -- essentially abolish the Second Amendment. By the way, if she gets to pick, if she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do, folks. Although the Second Amendment people, maybe there is, I don't know. But I tell you what, that will be a horrible day, if Hillary gets to put her judges in, right now we're tied."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sSUpKqMScw) [Trump responded to these statements](http://news.nationalpost.com/news/world/donald-trump-just-suggested-that-second-amendment-people-could-deal-with-hillary-clinton) deriding the "dishonest media" in the following statement:  gt; #8220;It #8217;s called the power of unification  #8212; 2nd Amendment people have amazing spirit and are tremendously unified, which gives them great political power, #8221; it said.  #8220;And this year, they will be voting in record numbers, and it won #8217;t be for Hillary Clinton, it will be for Donald Trump. #8221; Already, Senator Chris Murphy has labelled this an "assassination threat" - is the he right to label it so? Will the fallout to this statement be similar to the fallout from the Khan comments? What do you make of Trump's reaction? Further, does Donald Trump have a point regarding second amendment people voting for him in record numbers?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>What caused the polling/data operations in Rust Belt states to be so inaccurate?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-11-09 19:36:39</DATE>
    <TEXT>In Wisconsin, for instance, neither campaign's data pointed to a Trump victory, or even to Wisconsin being a swing state. The final RCP average was Clinton + 6.5. The same could be said to a lesser extent for Michigan and Pennsylvania. Even rust belt states expected to go red like Ohio and Indiana went much redder than polls would show - Clinton campaigned hard in Ohio with a celebrity studded lineup, and while the final polls had Trump + 2.2, he won Ohio by 8.6. In Indiana Trump won by 19.3 against an average of 10.7. Same for Iowa (Trump won +9.4 vs 3.0 polls). Across the board Trump massively outperformed all available data in the Rust Belt. What went wrong? How did both internal campaign data and professional pollsters fail to capture this shift? Were their likely voter screens faulty? Or is there some other underlying issue in polling the rust belt? How can pollsters do a better job in future elections?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Someone posted before me asking whether democrats should abandon the idea of gun control, but I thought this question might provide better focus to the discussion. I'll start with the disclaimer that I'm Canadian, so it's difficult for me to understand American gun culture, and I think a lot of Canadians look at the proliferation of guns in the United States with much consternation. But I won't presume to understand either side of the argument, and maybe I can learn from you. 1. Do you think gun violence rates are too high and that it is a serious societal issue that must be addressed 2. Is gun control the best solution to reduce gun violence? And if so, what is the best method of gun control? Is there a solution the both democrats and republicans could get behind? 3. What are the best alternate strategies for reducing gun violence in the short term and in the long term? Do you think any of these strategies would be more effective than gun control? Should these strategies replace or work together with gun control?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>What will result from the "Penelopegate" scandal surrounding French Presidential cadidate Francois Fillon?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-03-05 22:27:01</DATE>
    <TEXT>Ever since winning the French Republican primary, Francois Fillon has been mired in conflict regarding government money used to pay his wife Penelope who he claims he hired as an assistant in his political duties. Initially favored to win the presidency, he has fallen in polls of late, and as a formal legal investigation has begun into the legitimacy of the work offered to his wife, he has faced increasing decension within his own party. Yesterday Penelope spoke to the media saying the work she did was legitimate and earlier today Fillon held a large rally to demonstrate the support still behind his campaign. Tomorrow, the Republican party will meet to decide a way forward. Alain Juppe, who lost resoundingly to Fillon in a primary upset, has said he is willing to replace Fillon as the republican candidate, and recent polls have shown he could have a strong shot at winning the presidency, but he faces opposition in his party - notably from ex-president Sarkozy - and some feel he is not right-wing enough to lead their party. Do the republican leaders have a legitimate case for removing Fillon and would they? Do you think Fillon will resign of his own accord? Is their any basis to Fillon's claim that this is a political smear? Could Fillon possibly recover from this scandal if he continues his campaign? And if not Juppe, would anyone else be able to replace Fillon as a candidate? Edit: Juppe [just announced](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39177681) he will not replace Fillon:  gt; Mr Juppe, like Mr Fillon a former prime minister, did not hold back against any of the leading candidates on Monday. But he reserved his angriest comments for Mr Fillon, whose talk of a plot, and criticism of judges and the media, "has led him into a dead-end". "What a waste," he said.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Park, elected South Korea's first female Prime Minister in 2013, is the daughter of former president Park Chung-hee, and served four terms in parliament before acceding to the presidency. Her presidency was rather [moderately received](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Park_Geun-hye#/media/File:Park_Geun-hye_Presidential_Approval_Rating.svg) until a scandal that ended up ended up leading to her impeachment and bring her approvals down to under 4%. The scandal involved Park's confidante Choi Soon-sil, said due have extorted money from the state and played a hidden hand in state affairs. She has often been compared to Rasputin, and some believe she was the person really in charge of government during Park's tenure. [From BBC](http://www.cnn.com/2017/03/09/asia/south-korea-president-park-constitutional-court/index.html?adkey=bn):  gt;Local media and opposition parties have accused Choi of abusing her relationship with the president to force companies to donate millions of dollars to foundations she runs. She denies all charges against her. Today, South Korea's Constitutional Court unanimously upheld the National Assembly 234 to 56 vote to impeach Park. What will this mean for the country and international politics going forward? Will this lead to more power for the opposition? Will this lead to easing of ties with North Korea and China?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>At a press conference today Trump stated 'I now have responsibility' when it comes to Syria and the chemical attack against Syrian civilians "crossed a lot of lines for me". What will this mean in terms of American involvement in the Syrian War and in geopolitics in the region?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-04-05 20:56:37</DATE>
    <TEXT>-Assad continues to adamantly refuse his regime's involvement in these attacks, although they consisted of chemical weapons dropped from the air and independent agencies do not believe either ISIS or rebel forces have air capabilities. -Trump claimed the world is a mess, he inherited a mess, and he's going to fix it -Trump declared  #8220;My attitude toward Syria and Assad has changed very much, #8221; Trump said Wednesday, saying the latest attack  #8220;had a big impact on me. #8221; -Russia received sharp criticism at the UN for the chemical weapons attack Do Trump's words mean more than just rhetoric, and what would acting on his now "increased responsibility" look like? **Edit: Recent update:** "President Donald Trump has told some members of Congress that he is considering military action in Syria in retaliation for this week's chemical attack" ... "The source said the President had not firmly decided to go ahead with it but said he was discussing possible actions with Defense Secretary James Mattis. Trump is relying on the judgment of Mattis, according to the source." Graham and Mccain suggest the U.S. should "lead an international coalition to ground Assad #8217;s air force. #8221; **Edit 2:** Asked directly whether Assad should leave power, the president said,  #8220;I think what happened in Syria is a disgrace to humanity. He #8217;s there and I guess he #8217;s running things, so something should happen. #8221; **Edit 3:** Defense Secretary James Mattis will brief President Donald Trump on Thursday at Mar-a-Lago on military options against Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad's regime. Mattis is expected to present Trump with a range of options, including: - Grounding all Syrian aircraft - Strikes against their air defenses - Standoff strikes - Targeted strikes against those responsible for the chemical attack in Idlib. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said the conditions of Assad's ouster would be determined through the international political process. "The process by which Assad would leave is something that I think requires an international community effort, both to first defeat ISIS within Syria, to stabilize the Syrian country, to avoid further civil war, and then to work collectively with our partners around the world through a political process that would lead to Assad leaving," Tillerson told reporters on Thursday.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>The National Security Council has provided Trump a several options to the North Korea question, including killing Kim Jong-Un and placing nukes in South Korea. Which of the presented options do you think would be most effective and what do you expect Trump will do?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-04-07 23:24:22</DATE>
    <TEXT>Options include: - Nukes in South Korea:  gt;"We have 20 years of diplomacy and sanctions under our belt that has failed to stop the North Korean program," one senior intelligence official involved in the review told NBC News. "I'm not advocating pre-emptive war, nor do I think that the deployment of nuclear weapons buys more for us than it costs," but he stressed that the U.S. was dealing with a "war today" situation. But...  gt;"I don't think that [deploying nuclear weapons] is a good idea. I think that it will only inflame the view from Pyongyang," retired Adm. James Stavridis told NBC News. "I don't see any upside to it because the idea that we would use a nuclear weapon even against North Korea is highly unlikely." - Kill Kim Jong-Un: Adopting such an objective has huge downsides, said Lippert, who also served as an assistant defense secretary under President Barack Obama.  gt;"Discussions of regime change and decapitation...tend to cause the Chinese great pause of concern and tends to have them move in the opposite direction we would like them to move in terms of pressure," he said. - Covert action infiltrating U.S. and South Korean special forces into North Korea to sabotage or take out key infrastructure  #8212; for instance, blowing up bridges to block the movement of mobile missiles. The CIA, which would oversee such operations, told NBC News it could offer "no guidance" on this option. But Stavridis said that he felt it was the "best strategy" should the U.S. be forced to take military action. He described such action as: "some combination of special forces with South Korea and cyber." The Trump White House, through the National Security Council, asked for blue sky options in early February, a senior official told NBC on background. "Think big," the official said that the agencies were instructed. Many proposales have already been abandoned, but on the military side, sources say, the three options with the highest impact still constitute the next steps. So which option is best, can you think of something better, and what's Trump gonna do?

    <TEXT>Marijuana legalization was one of the cornerstones of Trudeau's platform, and he insists legalization and regulation by the government will curtail organized crime. Will Canada's legalization push prompt other countries around the world to do the same? Will more American states continue this trend?

    <TEXT>Yeah it's tough to say. If the outcome is really clear cut, it's definitely harder to spin things on either side, but I think there's a good chance the investigation will leave some ambiguity (as a random example say Flynn directly promised to cut Russian sanctions, but we can't prove that Trump knew about this; the Dems could argue against Trump's judgment and question how he couldn't have known, and the Reps could argue that Trump was blindsided by Flynn whom he subsequently fired.)</TEXT>

Hannity, however, continued to peddle the discredited conspiracy theory on his Twitter account. That's pretty awful.

    <TEXT>It will almost certainly go past a third round. Bernier will likely get high 20s - low 30s (according to polls). The first people to get knocked out (probably Obhrai, Peterson, Saxton, etc) get less than 1% in the polls, thus Bernier won't get much closer to 50 in those first rounds. Scheer might be more of a consensus candidate, but I reckon Bernier will be ahead enough (ahead 31 to 17 in [latest poll](http://ipolitics.ca/2017/05/25/bernier-has-85-per-cent-chance-of-winning-conservative-leadership-final-mainstreet-poll/)) to make him still the favourite. Certainly not everyone would choose Scheer over Bernier, and some would just leave a blank ballot after their number 1 choice.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Charisma was a problem too - try to think back to the last PM that got elected PM as the least charismatic candidate. With the exception of Jo Clark, who was in office for less than a year, you have to go back at least 50 years. Harper won against two candidates less charismatic than himself (Dion and Iggy), and lost to the more charismatic candidate. UYou can see the same trend in the states - the more charismatic candidate has won every election since FDR. nfortunately, charisma matters just as much as policy in politics.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think that's unfair to Wikipedia - Wikipedia has a pretty vigorous standard for properly sourced material and a reputation for neutrality. In fact it's been as accurate as Brittanica since 2005 ([according to Nature](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/4530930.stm)) and even gets cited in [court cases](https://blogs.wsj.com/law/2012/04/23/which-federal-appeals-court-cites-wikipedia-most/?KEYWORDS=wikipedia). I know anyone can write anything on Wikipedia and sometimes pages will get vandalized, but every change gets double checked by a host of established editors and that kind of thing gets taken down real fast.</TEXT>

The FI spoke often about how they were dissatisfied with the EU and want to renegotiate their relationship with them.

It's not that the cheapest telecom is private; it's that all telecom is private (with the exception of Sasktel, as far as I know), but the cheap ones are either nonexistant or subpar and unable to compete. Edit: Wind was apparently bought out by Shaw. Thanks u/Whipstock. I think this reinforces my point.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Bloc Quebecois Surge! Ah I've been in ukpolitics too much lately. Surprised to see the greens so high; from the [data](http://www.nanosresearch.com/data) that seems mostly from B.C. - I'm guessing they got a boost from the provincial greens. It'll be interesting to see if the greens can turn some of their provincial momentum on Vancouver Island into federal votes - would be huge for the green's future to get more than one seat - I imagine this could seriously hamper the NDP though who usually dominate the island, and vote splitting could give the Liberals some of those seats. Could be an interesting side narrative next election.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Iran, Saudi Arabia, arms deals, Yemen, disbanding relations with Qatar, the Syrian Civil War, sunni vs shi'a islam, funding of ISIS and terrorist groups, Russian involvment; how do these all fit together and who wants what?

    <DATE>2017-06-06 18:11:51</DATE>
    <TEXT>Making sense of the tangled web of alliances and proxy wars feels daunting, even as someone who follows global affairs daily and tries to keep up with world events - in fact perhaps that makes things more confusing as you can easily get lost in the trees and lose understanding of the underlying narrative. I've heard some call the Syrian War a proxy war between Iran and Saudi Arabia - does this assessment hold any water, and how does Assad's regime play into this? Some claim that Western countries shouldn't be selling arms to Saudi Arabia because they turn around and sell those weapons to terrorists. Is that true? And what's Qatar got to do with it? And what's the War in Yemen got to do with any of this? Russia seems to have clear alliances with Syria and wants to wield influence in the region but where do they stand on the Saudi/Iran divide? What is the best way for Western countries to navigate this?</TEXT>

Not to mention the Labour party being far from cohesive behind Corbyn. I doubt the next Tory campaign will be as disastrous, but with Conservatives likely to take the fall from any negative Brexit repercussions and the next Labour campaign likely to be much more supportive of Corbyn (many Labour MPs that had been vocal opposed to Corbyn went on air last night saying they were very wrong about him), I think Labour still has a good shot at winning the next election.</TEXT>

A further 13% name someone else incorrectly when asked who leads the Ontario Liberals (most commonly Justin Trudeau, but a few also named Hazel McCallion). Also, those figures show pretty clear dislike for cap and trade, with only 18-34 year olds being slightly more in favour.

Nate Silver gave Trump a 25% chance of winning just before the election. The only big polling error came from rust belt states where Trump voters were underrepresented.</TEXT>

The final poll average from RCP [was Trump +4.8](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/ga/georgia_trump_vs_clinton-5741.html) and the result was Trump +5.1. That's pretty damn close.  gt;Do you not remember MSNBC and CNN saying Trump has "no path to 270" while pushing polls that say Hillary is winning Florida, Ohio, North Carolina and PA in huge blowouts? My comment was all about how the media misportrayed things. The average polls were close to the result; the media misreported it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Reading beyond the headline, the main argument of the article is:  gt;The beneficiaries of the right-wing decline have variously been politicians on the left (such as Austria #8217;s Van der Bellen2), the center-left (such as France #8217;s Emmanuel Macron) and the center-right (such as Germany #8217;s Angela Merkel, whose Christian Democratic Union has rebounded in polls). But there #8217;s been another pattern in who gains or loses support: The warmer a candidate #8217;s relationship with Trump, the worse he or she has tended to do.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; Designing an appropriate regulatory system for cannabis edibles is a complex undertaking and there are unique potential health risks and harms that need to be carefully understood before the development and coming into force of these regulations. For this reason, the Government of Canada will need to take an appropriate amount of time to develop, and implement regulations that will result in safe edible products eventually coming to market.  gt;Once regulatory oversight for these products - such as measures to protect public health and safety, standardized serving sizes and potency, child-resistant packaging requirements, and standardized health warnings - has been developed and put in place, it is the intention of the Government to allow edibles to be sold. That sounds reasonable. Do it slow and get it right.</TEXT>

You can think "us" is a better word here, but we shouldn't change the anthem we've been brought up with.

    <TEXT>That's not where I was going with this comment. I meant two threads can come to vastly different conclusions on the same story depending on who reads and comments. I love the idea of an online community where folks with many different viewpoints can discuss the issues of the day together, but unfortunately since likeminded people tend to gravitate to the same threads, those threads show a homogenous viewpoint that is unrepresentative of the whole population. You might support my argument if I give r/politics as an example. Articles and comments get upvoted there depending on how anti-Trump or anti-Republican they are, regardless of the substance of those arguments. There's no discussion of real political issues. The big political story today is about North Korea's missile launch, but you'd have no idea from reading r/politics because that story is not anti-Trump (nor is it pro Trump, but that's the point - only anti-Trump/Republican stuff gets upvoted in the echo chamber)</TEXT>

The point of my comment was to show that two threads discussing exactly the same thing can come to wildly different conclusions because people gravitate to threads with redditors who express opinions they agree with. If there's one thing people on the right and left both agree with (according to polls) it's that we're more divided than ever.

    <TEXT>That's interesting. I thought Singh actually did the same as Angus, to an even greater degree. His answer to most questions was 'we need to come together and make a plan', 'we need to end poverty', and other vagueries. I'd actually rank Singh lower than Angus on this debate because when he didn't speak vaguely, he was aggressively attacking his opponents in a hostile way (i.e. Guy you don't care about poverty). I don't mind being corrected though. How did you find Singh more substantive?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Just so we're clear because there seems to be much confusion here: McCain voted yes on proceeding: to begin debate on a variety of bills. He has not said voted for any bill itself as is. He still might, but he hasn't yet. Edit: I'm not trying to support McCain here, and his voting record may suggest he will end up voting with leadership despite his rhetoric. I also would prefer they have a real bill with bipartisan support before opening debate on it. But I want to avoid misinformation (because there way too much misleading information in today's bubbles) and stick to the facts. So far he voted to continue debate, and has not voted to pass a healthcare bill.</TEXT>

So most of the more moderate Republicans likely opposed leadership more than their Trump score would avail.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>The Senate narrowly failed to pass an Obamacare repeal bill this morning. What does this mean for the future of this congress and the Republican Party?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-07-28 09:00:02</DATE>
    <TEXT>Today, the "skinny repeal" - widely seen as the healthcare bill most expected to pass in the senate - failed 51-49, with the votes of three Republican senators - Collins, Murkowski, and (dramatically) John McCain. Does this signify the end of Obamacare repeal? Will Republicans, who control the majority in the house and the senate, move on to tax reform and other issues? What does this mean for midterm elections in 2018? Will anyone heed McCain and Schumer's words on bipartisanship? Additionally, Trump just tweeted  gt;3 Republicans and 48 Democrats let the American people down. As I said from the beginning, let ObamaCare implode, then deal. Watch! Could he actively work to sabotage Obamacare? Is there a politically viable path for Republicans and Dems to come together and stabilize the current Obamacare? One last question: The process of crafting this bill was widely derided by both Democrats and Republicans. Republicans from McCain to Johnson to Paul criticized McConnell and Republican leadership for the secretive way the bill was put together. McConnell apparently didn't even know where all his Senators would fall up to the last minute - as seen by the fact that VP Mike Pence was flown in and stood around the senate for about an hour as it became obvious that he did not in fact have the votes. Does McConnell failure to get this passed jeopardize his leadership - and is there anyone who would have the support of Republicans to replace him as majority leader? (Some commentators suggested Cruz was jockeying for the spot given his words on CNN afterwards, but previous comments from other senators (Graham, Franken, etc) suggests he doesn't have many friends in the senate).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The most concerning thing to me is North Korea. Congress can stymie him on much of his domestic agenda, but he has a lot of unilateral power over foreign policy. Clearly, he didn't care what the healthcare bill did because he said he'd sign *anything* congress passed. He just wanted a win. If he sees nothing else going his way, he could decide to take drastic measures with North Korea to try and get that win. So far most of his troubles have been self-inflicted and he hasn't faced a real external threat. North Korea could be that threat, and he could fire off nukes with the click of a button. Not that I *think* he'll do that, but I worry.</TEXT>

He hasn't been able to get any 'wins' through congress, and his biggest moment of positive feedback thus far has been the Syria strike. Starting a patriotic war with North Korea might be what he sees as the best way to get a win without congress. And he has unilateral power over the nukes.

    <TEXT>They aren't exactly cutting Trump loose. They're trying to support Trump and fight the Republican establishment - look at the recent campaigns against McMaster, Ryan  amp; co. for instance. Trump largely validates this, which ironically weakens his power (you can't get much done - at least legislatively - without the establishment). They're effectively sowing (or exploiting) a rift in the Republican party, thereby incapacitating them. They're also pushing against the mainstream (read:establishment) media and promoting TrumpTv - \#fake and \#trumptv are two of the [leading hashtags](http://dashboard.securingdemocracy.org) at the moment.</TEXT>

Despite popular belief, polling [was actually quite accurate](http://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/campaign/315145-one-last-look-2016-polls-actually-got-a-lot-right) in the 2016 election though some state polls were off especially in the rust belt. Unfortunately [there wasn't much](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statewide_opinion_polling_for_the_United_States_presidential_election,_2016#Alabama) polling in Alabama for comparison and nothing after September. But for the Alabama senate race, there's a [slew of polls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_special_election_in_Alabama,_2017#Polling) that all show Moore with a lead well outside the margin of error so I'd be quite surprised if he did not get the most votes on the first ballot.

    <TITLE>Historically, how accurately have pundits/political analysts accurately predicted changing presidential voting patterns - like New York, Vermont and California turning solidly blue or West Virginia turning solidly red in the 90s?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-09-11 18:45:42</DATE>
    <TEXT>Analysts today often discuss Virginia and the Sun Belt (especially Texas, the Carolinas, Georgia, Arizona, Nevada) becoming more Democratic and the Rust Belt (Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, Iowa, Wisconsin. Not so much New York and Illinois) becoming Republican, and substantiate this with underlying demographic trends (the white working class in the Rust Belt trends red, the growing number of Hispanics in the Sun Belt trends blue). Have analysts made similar predictions about changing voting patterns in the past, and how accurate have they been? New York for instance, was always a swing state. Did analysts accurately predict its turning blue? Vermont used to be solidly R, and California leaned R. West Virginia used to be solidly D. Did they predict this? I imagine passing the Civil Rights Acts in the 60s made losing the "solid South" foreseeable but were other political realignments well-predicted?</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; Scheer is the leader of the official opposition, and it's his job to sow doubt and generate debate on whatever the government does. This is what I dislike about politics, especially opposition party politics. Generating debate is healthy and necessary. Sowing doubt about every policy taken by the other team is toxic and fosters today's divided partisan environment. Far too often partisans focus on sowing doubt rather than generating debate and looking for a positive compromise.</TEXT>

Midterm years tend to go against the party in power, especially if the president is unpopular (and yes, Trump has [higher disapproval than approval in Arizona](https://www.google.ca/amp/amp.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2017/08/22/new_poll_shows_most_arizona_voters_don_t_approve_of_trump_presidency.html).)

    <TITLE>What checks and balances exist for the Supreme Court?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-10-09 02:06:44</DATE>
    <TEXT>My understanding of the US system of checks and balances is the three co-equal branches are expected to act as continual counterbalances to each other, and no one branch rules over the rest. However, SCOTUS appointments are lifelong. What would prevent, for instance, the appointed judges from making an unconstitutional decision? What if a judge becomes mentally insane or otherwise incapacitated, but refuses to step down? What would prevent the senate and president from appointing SCOTUS' that act in a completely partisan manner, and serve to rubber stamp a party's agenda rather than actually applying the constitutional law. Say, for instance, the senate became filled with Roy Moore types that wish to apply the law in ways that are currently deemed unconstitutional. What would prevent them from electing justices that will do their bidding for the next 30 years, rather than apply the law according to a generally accepted interpretation of the constitution?</TEXT>

Enthusiasm, yes, due to Trump's low approval, and Democrats being the opposition party. Republicans are retiring more rapidly and Dems are recruiting lots of candidates, plus Dems are doing really well on generic ballots. I think most Virginia polls underestimated Democratic enthusiasm in their likely voter models.</TEXT>

The could lose 1 of their current seats if they win 3 of Arizona (possibly 2 seats there), Nevada, Tennessee, Texas. Or retain all their seats and win 2.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi all, In a small group and we brought up the following two interesting questions. These are questions I've certainly pondered before but have always struggled to find a satisfying answer. Maybe this community has some ideas on it! 1. Why is God jealous? The Old Testament often talks about this jealous God that wants you to put him before anything and everything; give him your unrapt attention, devote every moment of your life to. Why is he so demanding? How does this square with the ever-patient, alltruistic, sacrificing God we see elsewhere? 2. Why did God make us? What was the point? If he's completely self-sufficient and complete, he wouldn't gain anything from making us right?</TEXT>

I don't think there's anything wrong with this analogy and while there are clearly problems with politicians behaving badly, some word policing and sensitivity goes overboard (like the Conservative MP, taking a picture with two others, quipping 'this is not my idea of a threesome' - maybe off-colour, but damn, I don't think it's healthy to police every little joke that might offend someone).

    <TEXT>Honestly, big "L" Liberal parties fall in such variant places on the left-right spectrum everywhere. Like the [Quebec Liberal Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quebec_Liberal_Party) is centre-right, as are the BC libs and [Nova Scotia libs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nova_Scotia_Liberal_Party). The federal party, and the [Ontario libs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario_Liberal_Party) are centre-left. In the UK, the [lib-dems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Democrats_(UK) are centrist, while the [Australian Liberals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Party_of_Australia) are right to centre-right, and the [Filipino Liberal Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Party_(Philippines) is centre-left. The definition of Liberalism is quite broad - and today is often a muddle of classical and modern understandings of the term. As the [wiki article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism_by_country) on international Liberalism notes "All liberal parties emphasise (sic) individual rights, but they differ in their opinion on an active role for the state."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Haha thanks; I was trying to figure the out what the victory was. There's also this:  gt;Turmel ran for the board of the National Capital Freenet after the previous board reduced the number of seats from 7 to 5. He came 6th, and argues he was cheated out of the only election he ever won. Guy can't catch a break!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>1. Voting intention polls are *not* the same as approval polls. Just because you like someone, doesn't mean you'll vote for them. The latest nanos has the Liberals at 40 to 30 for Conservatives and 17.5 for NDP. 2. That's from October 12th, although we don't have many recent approval polls - latest is from Nov 9 (we have lots of recent voting intention polls, many showing October as a low point) 3. With the approval polls we *do* have, u/brunes is mistaken here. The [current aggregate](http://www.cbc.ca/news2/interactives/leadermeter/index.html) has Trudeau at 49.1 approve to 40.3 dissaprove.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well, the Liberals won. They're up by 5% with 95% of votes counted so it's mathematically impossible for them to lose. Everyone will have their own read on this. On the one hand, it's rare for the incumbent party to gain seats in byelections, so Liberals have much to be optimistic about. On the other hand, Hogg was a very good candidate, and I'm sure that helped. I think it's always better to look at the aggregate of byelections before assessing any trends.</TEXT>

For those that said I wasn't genuine with my questions that's on you. I woke up this morning feeling like I really needed to understand the other side instead of shutting them out. Honestly, hate was filling my heart I wanted to break free from feeling like I had to vote for one side or I wouldn't be a christian anymore. For future elections I will be doing much more research into each candidate. Also a lot of you brought up things about Democrats that I had no clue about and will be looking into further. Lots of you provided good reading material and I bookmarked it all. So far I have read every comment in my inbox which has been a ton but I have things to do today. So I am going to step aside. Thanks and God bless! To me it sounds like OP just never actually understood the other side, and used this platform to seek out that understanding. Honestly what needs to happen to heal the divisions of partisan politics.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Edit: Trump's approval is quite likely better with those who stayed home than those who voted, but it has decreased, even in Alabama. Regardless, everything depends on the electorate that shows up, and the Democrat-leaning electorate could be just as motivated in 2020. Those commenting on this are overlooking the fact that Trump's approval/disapproval was even in the Alabama exit polls. Yeah, Roy Moore helped a lot, but Trump's standing in Alabama had already significantly declined since election day, and those who dislike Trump were more motivated to get out and vote. Much will depend on what electorate shows up to vote in 2020, and ya'll are too confident in your predictions of what that electorate will look like.</TEXT>

Vegas is the only new expansion team to have a positive goal differential for instance - and they have a significant one (0.7/game) at that. Before Vegas, no team in the NHL, NBA, or MLB ever had a win percentage above 43.8; Vegas has 72.6. We knew Vegas was very good, but it's mindblowing to quantify how much they blow away the competition.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Automatically? 10 years. But Trump can declassify anything [at will](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/15/us/politics/trump-classified-secrets.html)  gt; #8220;The classification system is not based on a law, #8221; said Steven Aftergood, a government secrecy specialist with the Federation of American Scientists.  #8220;It is an expression of presidential authority, and that means that the president and his designees decide what is classified, and they have the essentially unlimited authority to declassify at will. When Trump divulged classified information to the Russians in their oval office meeting, for instance, he did so immediately, without any time gap. I'm not here to argue whether that was wise, but it *was* perfectly [within his authority](http://dailycaller.com/2017/05/15/trump-can-declassify-intelligence-as-president-but-giving-it-to-the-russians-is-a-first/)  gt;Executive Order 12356, signed by former President Ronald Reagan in 1982, gave the authority to the official who originally classified information to declassify it. Former President Barack Obama followed up that order with E.O. 13526 in 2009, which adjusted some of the earlier order #8217;s provisions.  gt; #8220;The official who authorized the original classification, if that official is still serving in the same position and has original classification authority; (2) the originator #8217;s current successor in function, if that individual has original classification authority; (3) a supervisory official of either the originator or his or her successor in function, if the supervisory official has original classification authority; or (4) officials delegated declassification authority in writing by the agency head or the senior agency official of the originating agency, #8221; according to the order.  gt;The president is the ultimate authority over the intelligence agencies that classify material, meaning Trump can choose to declassify material if he so chooses. So there really isn't a time frame on declassficiation, if the president chooses to do so. He could \#releasethememo immediately if he so chose.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;This is one isolated Tim Horton' s franchise owner  gt;A staff memo written by a couple of Tim Hortons franchise owners in Whitby, Ont. In the interest of accuracy I'll nitpick to say this was a couple franchises, not one - though your point stands that these franchises shouldn't be taken to represent all of Tim Horton's. Tim Horton's certainly has a branding/messaging issue, and I think a lot of Canadians have stopped identifying with them as part of their Canadian identity and as [*the* place to go for coffee](http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/the-results-are-in-tim-hortons-is-no-longer-canadas-favourite-coffee-shop/) (to which I agree - their coffee kinda sucks). Hopefully most Ontarians don't take this memo (or antipathy towards the memo) into consideration when actually voting, though it plays well into Wynne's messaging around minimum wage and corporations being out of touch.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The thing to keep in mind with that score though is many of those votes are to approve or reject cabinet ministers or political appointments, which is not necessarily a left-right thing. Democrats teamed together to vote down Betsy Devos, for instance, more for lack of qualification than policy stances, whereas Republicans mostly voted for her (give her a chance). This was the case with many of these appointments, and skews the Trumpscore in a fairly partisan manner. So I think it's fairly useful in showing how Liberally someone is compared to the rest of their own party, but Manchin and Collins, for instance, are probably closer to each other than their scores show.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Are you arguing all morality is relative? In which case how do we set a baseline moral standard in the first place? If by standard of reciprocity you mean we can't hold fetuses morally responsible for anything, therefore we can't grant them personhood, couldn't you argue the same for a neonate (who is wholly dependent on the parent for daily living and has little agency over their decisions). Anyway this line of reasoning sidesteps why many pro-lifers oppose abortion (and I'm not going to take a stance here, I just want to flesh out the argument) - they believe in souls, and that every conception bestows a soul unto the newly created person. I understand you disagree with this kind of dualism, but I think turning this into ad hominems by calling those who believe in this moronic damages our political discourse.</TEXT>

Wasn't like that with previous presidents (obviously America is our biggest ally and their decisions are hugely impactful around the world, so any big decisions American presidents made got a fair bit of press) but Trump is a ... unique president, and so all the abnormal things that he does gets constant play in the media here.</TEXT>

Obama The less charismatic presidents seem to have lower estimation, at least in academic rankings: Nixon Ford Carter HW wasn't so charismatic, but he's usually considered a middling president. I agree with you that we place too much focus on charisma, but disagree - at least in American history - that the list of particularly charismatic presidents (if you broaden that to characters we can include folks like MLK) ain't a good list.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Store-bought broccoli sprouts - an effective method for sulforaphane intake?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-02-05 23:05:06</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hey guys, lots of folks here talk about growing their own broccoli sprouts (especially since sulphoraphane tablets seem unstable), but has anyone tried buying store bought sprouts? For instance, I can get them [at a local store here in Canada](https://www.saveonfoods.com/pd/Eatmore/Organic-Broccoli-Sprouts/60-g/062603110012/). Would freezing these and putting some of in my smoothie in the morning be an effective way to get bioavailable, stable sulforaphane? How much should I eat/day? Edit: Many comments here refer to growing your own sprouts. I know it's not so hard, but I still prefer not having to store it, wash it every day, and make sure I harvest at the right time to avoid bacteria. I was hoping morevover to know whether getting the sprouts from the store would work just as well, and if there'd be less risk of bacteria than growing on my own. Seems at least [they're cognizant](http://eatmoresprouts.com/contact-us/faq/) (the store I'm buying from) of the importance of fresh products and avoiding mould, etc.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm sure that'd be cheaper in the longrun, but frankly I don't want the hassle of monitoring them and making sure they don't go bad/knowing when to pick them etc. Looking for something as efficient as possible that actually works. I'd invest in sulforaphane tablets for instance, if not for the stability/bioavailability concerns E: A word</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I appreciate the advice, the problem is keeping track of it every day - sometimes I'll forget - getting the mason jars and finding a place to store them in my house etc. If I go away for a couple days it's a hassle, whereas with broccoli sprouts in the freezer it's no issue. Also remember when to harvest and worrying about E Coli etc. For me personally, convenience factor is worth more than paying a few bucks a week for store-bought broccoli sprouts.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Man the comments on that article are patently bullshit. I've heard more and more media outlets and podcasts referencing 538 over the past two years - so I think they've only become more relevant, and 538 was the only poll aggregator that gave Trump a decent chance (~30%) of winning and they ran articles before election night speaking about how Trump has a better shot than the media gives him credit for. Whatever happens with 538, I hope they continue to operate under their own agency and not fall into the media echo chamber. I'll definitely miss Harry's banter though.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Margin of error is very high because the subsamples are small. Nanos uses a 4-week rolling average of 1,000 people. Of those thousand, 250 are interviewed every week. Only a fraction of those 250 are 30-39 year olds (~3 million people are 30-39 - maybe 1/8 of the voting population). So the weekly subsample is like 30 people and it's normal to get wild fluctuations when the sample size is so small.</TEXT>

Got me wondering if Italian is only 12% different from Latin, do Italians have an easier time just picking up a Latin text, even if they haven't formally studied Latin?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't think there's any real personal risk in buying it. I've always gotten moda delivered directly to my door. If your package gets seized at customs, you lose the money you spent but that's about it. I've never heard of anyone actually getting into legal trouble or trouble with the RCMP from importing and it's not illegal to possess it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No, I used to reship with amforward (buying from modafinilexpress) but you it's a hassle to reship and choosing the wrong shipping company (i.e. Fedex, UPS) leads to customs seizure. BtcNootropics ships directly to my door, so buying from them I don't have to worry about reshipers.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Edit ([according to CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/05/europe/italy-elections-intl/index.html)): The five star leader said they are "absolute winners of the election," before adding that the party was "open to talks with other parties" to form a government. Everything hinges on with whom/whether ~~MI5~~ M5S forms a coalition. The hot take is this spells doom for Europe, though I think that's far from determined while ~~MI5~~ M5S plays kingmaker - seems they've been [all over the map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Star_Movement#European_integration) with regards to Europe, though their leader most recently stated "European Union is the Five Star Movement's home". Until ~~MI5~~ M5S actually decides on a coalition partner, the only certainty is uncertainty. And they may not - which could lead to political gridlock and, I assume, another election.</TEXT>
