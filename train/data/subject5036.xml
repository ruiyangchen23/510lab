    <TEXT>I asked this under the wrong subreddit earlier. Just curious what other people's imagination says. So what is a technological advancement, that you have dreamt of or spontaneously thought of that you would think had been thought of by now?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>IRS Employees of Reddit, what are "Red Flags" when reviewing people's tax forms that can proceed to being audited?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2013-02-12 03:44:44</DATE>
    <TEXT>What are "Red Flags" when reviewing people's tax forms that can initiate an audit? What are guidelines that you follow, or specific things that you look for when going through tax forms? Does the IRS actually review every tax form? EDIT: holy cow! Didn't think this post would get this much attention! Thanks to everyone! EDIT2: I am an honest tax payer, I have payed my taxes already. I am just wondering because I am in the US Military and I only make about 29K a year and I was audited last year and didn't receive a penny from my STATE taxes (NY) and I also never heard back from the IRS. EDIT3: thank you all for your very interesting responses! I have learned so much! EDIT4: I Love You Guys! Edit 5: so far we have learned to not write anything in the section that says "do not write here", don't make $20,000 deductions for "snacks" (thank you Robin Williams) and if you don't own a business or make less than $57,000, DO YOUR OWN DAMN TAXES. Thank you all for your great inputs! I'm still reading along. Edit 6: I created this post because I know people out there, like me, who have tons of questions. I hope you can all find an answer here. Thank you all for your responses! Edit 7: THANK YOU TO EVERYONE WHO CONTRIBUTED TO THIS POST! PAY YOUR TAXES! I hope you all have a wonderful year! TIL-allot. Thanks REDDIT! :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I just got promoted thanks to you guys and a great Q amp;A thread I had this past weekend. I'm interested in strictly oval nascar series and trucks, nascar national and indycar series as well. What is the participation like in these series and/or should I stick with something else? I see the team racing trucks in D class and I've watched the videos on it, but I'm still confused. Do I HAVE to do driver swaps in the team racing trucks or can I just create a team and race in this series like I would in any other series by myself? What is the difference? Again Reddit, thank you guys so much. This subreddit is awesome!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>What /u/noahplow said. I've played outfield my whole life and transferred to SS last year and first base. Made a few E's in the first half of the year last year, but one thing that really helped me out was getting as low and close to the ground as possible. Now I'm 6'7" and that's kinda tough to do, but I just go with a Albert Pujols-esque type of crouch when I'm on the field. The lower you are to the ground, the easier it will be to react and judge those sharp grounders coming your way. Didn't make a single error after I started doing that. Now I'm the starting 3B and SS for 3 of the 4 teams I'm in for this upcoming season. The snow can not melt fast enough here in Boston!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>1. Stay as low to the ground as possible, I always have a really low "Albert pujols-esque" crouch at first, makes it real easy to catch every hop. 2. Pay attention! Even if the ball gets hit into the outfield, that doesn't necessarily mean you're out of the play. I have a cannon, and when I play CO-ED I play LC, if I feel like I can throw a runner out at 1B I'm coming your way! I knocked some teeth out of my first baseman last year. I got the ball, saw the guy was speed-walking to first and BAM! She never saw it coming even though I had done it numerous times in the past. I have no sympathy for runners, if you don't run, you're getting shot!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have both. I bought a playstation for GT and the XBO for Forza. I have a PC for iracing (anyone else do iracing in this sub?) You will be slightly disappointed with GT6 coming from Forza IMO. It just gets old real quick. Compared to Sims like Assetto Corsa and Iracing. I dabble between all of them and I probably have the most miles in GT6 since the day it came out, but it just got old quick for me. Now, am I disappointed in GT6? No. I love the franchise and have always been a fan and you can damn well be very sure to expect me to get the PS4 when the next one comes out, but, with that being said. It gets old quick. Edit- Id say go for it. It's still fun. Just got old for me real quick, but that's just me, man. It's worth it.</TEXT>

Im just saying, it wasn't banned when he took them, so *technically* speaking, yes, it is okay, I guess. I understand your point of view, but I guarantee you that there are things that people take right now to get an edge that are not banned yet, but will be in the future and it's the same cycle over and over again. I'm not condoning it. I'm just saying it wasn't banned at that point in time because the issue had not been brought up.

    <TEXT>Well, I worked on the Marine side in NC, but the prowler was one of those jets that these pilots fly and think they're in an airshow with some of the G's they try to pull. It's like trying to drive a mini-van like its an F1 Ferrari. These jets go out on a 1 hour flight and come back with an average of 56 hours worth of discrepancies. All the systems are outdated, it hasn't really done its job since desert storm, and it's just and old dying breed. Only thing they are good for on the battlefield is a good old fashioned "show of force" because they are so damn loud and slow. I can tell you they barely do their job because those antennas go bad 4 out of every 5 flights and the jet just becomes useless mid flight. Sorry for my rant. I just don't miss working on these things. They're cool and all, but it hardly ever works when it's needed most.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I bought it from one of the admins on the Facebook page, it's an awesome bat, you really don't feel the ball fly off when hit so it's kinda weird because the sound makes it feel like you're hitting mush balls but it carries further than ALMOST any other bat that I've owned, I've never seen a bat with as much flex as the insane. There were only 500 of the originals made if I recall correctly, but they just made another 500 that should be out late June last I heard. Look for the /r/slowpitch Facebook page and ask for MR Bonin. He's the Demarini rep that I bought those two from. I would also recommend the demarini aftermath (only reason I have not bought a second one is because it hasn't broken yet but I hit piss rockets with that bat) I originally bought my first insane and it was stolen after a mixed nighttime bp session that we did during the pre season. Guess the bat was just that hot! I had literally taken it out of the wrapper before that BP.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For those giving the PTSD excuses as to why kids shouldn't want to be in the military, that's bullshit. Everyone joins the military for their own reasons. I'm a Marine on my 8th year, a recruiter at that, and I've seen every reason out there for why these kids want to join the service. If you want to go infantry because you just watched American Sniper and thought it was cool, you're an idiot, but at the same time, I always ask my applicants that WANT infantry why, it's always a different excuse. Not because some dumb kid saw a baseball player wearing a cammo shirt. Some kids do it for the money because they grew up in a poor family, some do it for the benefits, some do it to get out of the streets because they live in a shitty neighborhood, some do it for the education and some do it because they a fucking crazy. I've seen it all, but they all know what they are getting themselves into now a days. It's not like it's not on the news every day. /rant over. Sorry.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The food was great! I was in Bagram twice and got to try some of the national food out there and it was awesome! Just make sure you don't eat the pepper! Also, they are genuinely good people, you gotta think, some of them do bad things in our eyes, but that's just their culture. They don't grow up watching tv, they don't have tvs or radios so they grow up on the same customs that their parents and great grandparents grew up on, so some of them might have a bad image against us because all they think is that we invaded them, they have no clue what's going on. Yeah, they might be a bit different than us, for instance, I don't believe that someone should be stoned to death. It's crazy! But that's their culture. I'm Dominican, and I came from a poor family and now I am very well off, but when I look back at some of the things my family did when I was growing up, I would never agree to any of that stuff now. Because I grew up on those customs. Edit- back to the food, if you ever get a chance to try afghan food, try to sweet nan, it's basically sweet bread. Amazing!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Head on over to /r/slowpitch and people post videos all the time about critiques and pointers, if you go on Facebook and look up the /r/slowpitch shenanigans page you will see all kinds of helpful things on the page that will help you out. It's definitely not too hard to learn, just go to the batting cages and hit the ball as hard as you can! I feel that it is better to learn the hand-eye coordination first so that you can at least make contact with the pitch, worry about mechanics later on when you are a more solid player. I came from a baseball background so it was a bit different for me, took me about 5 years to adjust to the game as I was playing on and off. Good luck and don't give up on yourself. Just go out there and have fun!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm not a road racing guy. So respectively my SR in rookies was like a 1.20 or something and just stuck to ovals where I'm good at. Now, I don't remember purchasing Mazda speedway aka Laguna seca. But I grew up playing on that track on gran turismo and I just happened to look at the schedule one Saturday and noticed the mx5 cup on that track. I couldn't resist! I love that track so much, it's almost like it taught me how to be a road racer. I can finally race without getting 12x-16x because of all the off-tracks. Best track ever!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>And the guy in third place thought it would be a great idea and push me (the leader) in the bumper as soon as the pace car took off. Now, I always go on green. This IDIOT turned me into the second place car which then caused for a huge road block at the drop of the green flag and wrecked EVERY SINGLE CAR in the race. It was amazing. I have never seen such a thing before. There were 25+ cars on the lead lap. Everyone was wrecked. How bad was everyone wrecked? Well I had 8 total minutes of REQUIRED repairs and still only went 2 laps down. I took the replays for the protests, but I just don't know how to post them on here. I might have to record them via potato. Anyone else have similar experiences?</TEXT>

I started 27th and by lap 11 I was in 3rd and then took the lead around lap 25 and just ran away. Until of course the next caution when THAT happened. You wouldn't happen to have a video of the thing would you? I was going to report the guy, but now the heat blew over and I'm no longer pissed.

I just never cared for road racing, in fact my first ten or so races I had been disqualified with 17X's here and there. So I gave up on road a year ago when I started. Managed to get up to B in ovals and have averaged a few wins here and there. But I sat down last week and concentrated on road because the damn skippy looks so much fun! And managed to bring my SR up from a measly 1.25 to a promotion a few minutes ago on a few races a month. That's an accomplishment for me, sir. Funny thing is though, I still have trouble wiping it seems like...  #3232;_ #3232;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah it is very frustrating.. I know of a few guys who might come in mind actually that MIGHT be doing something like this. In quite a few of the truck races I have done there have been some guys that just pull away from the field and get themselves 10 second leads and such. While I'm over here in 2nd just chewing up the tires trying to stay ahead of 3rd. Now, I don't see it as a problem, some guys are just naturally gifted like that. BUT, when these guys don't PIT after 20-something laps of wear on their tires and still manage to pull away like that? There's no freakin way! Especially when these guys can keep running "qualifying" lap times over and over until the last laps. That's just questionable to me. I remember studying one guy's lap times after a race and then I checked what the track record was and he was barely just missing the track record almost every lap. I never thought anything of it until this came up. E- spelling</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey don't sweat it man, I had a 1500 irating last week with a 1.24 SR on road and now I have a 2.59 SR with an laughable irating of about 800. I'm a D class road guy. Oval racing is definitely my strength. I have YET to finish a road race with less than a 4X, but I'd rather finish last than just quitting out. At least it will help the SR if you just cruise around. So take it easy, worry about it once you get to A. I see plenty of guys in A class that have horrible iratings. As long as you race safely, it will climb with experience.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hello everyone! I just purchased a DK2, so like the title says, I can't get it to work at all. I have a constant orange light even though the runtime service doesn't tell me there are any issues. I only get a "blue" light during startup on my laptop and then once it fully runs up it goes to orange. If I hit the "test world"(forgot what it actually says) button on the runtime it shows up on the desktop but not on the HMD. Can anyone help?</TEXT>

    <DATE>2015-10-04 21:22:03</DATE>
    <TEXT>I feel like Iracing could do som improvements with the dynamic track system, at least on the visual aspect of things. I have yet to really notice any difference, there have been times when racing ovals where I've had to search for a better line which was not something I was used to before this update, but one huge thing I Noticed is that the track had no rubber before the race started and by lap 14 it already had a pretty noticeable difference and a pretty solid black line around the turns. Just not something I have noticed in Iracing even after a few 200 lap races this week at Dover. Thoughts? This is not a rant, by the way, just an observation. There is always room for improvement.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If I didn't use the oculus rift, I would totally say that's messed up what he did, but unfortunately it is still your fault. Although in my opinion, what he was doing is borderline blocking (I don't disagree with you on this, either) this is the type of prick who would do this and then get mad at you on the radio because you had no room to be there. But at the same time, it enrages me that people can do these things and just think they are going to keep getting away with it like he did the first time. People like him have no regards for safety. Now, I use the Oculus rift, and let me tell you how much harder it is to race with that thing, I have to give it up to real world drivers, in a position like this in real world, these drivers down have the FOV mirror to help, and it's definitely not there in the oculus so it makes it 10 times more difficult to know if someone is on your side and coming up real quick as well because you have to rely on the AI spotter to tell you "left side" or "clear" but you don't have that mirror to see if someone is already peeking in there and give them room. That's my opinion in the matter. Don't get me wrong, watching this video makes my blood boil because that is rookie level shit that he did there. Took me back to those days. Whether it's right or wrong, it's racing etiquette and common curtesy (at least it should be) unfortunately shit like this happens.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm sorry but I just can't do that. I just left the Marine Corps after 8 years and went into corporate America and I have this "team leader" who I'm now supposed to report to, a month older than me and absolutely NO LEADERSHIP qualities at all. She doesn't train, doesn't teach, gives me an attitude when I ask a question that I can't find the answer to on Google, she's disrespectful, has no tact and most importantly, doesn't supervise. Apparently she is a team leader because everyone else quit before I got there and she's the one that's been there the longest. 2 whole years. I know that there are people in here who have gone through what I am going through now, I went from being a respected Marine, in charge of an office and a great team, to now being under someone who's leadership capabilities are worse than a 17 year old private in the military. I tried being nice, we've changed a lot of things around since I got there for that very reason. But I have to admit, I have a huge ego, I am very competitive and I am money motivated. There are going to be some feelings hurt when I am more experienced in what I'm selling here. I can't wait to be in charge of her!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is totally legal on Restarts people. Restarts and restarts only though. In the video, he is double file, meaning thats the start of the race as in Iracing Indy you only start single file. if you read 2-4 or 2-3 ( I cant correctly remember which one) it says you cant pass anyone before the start finnish line on the start of the race. So yes, your move is Illegal AT THE START OF THE RACE* but you can do it on any other restarts. Edit- /u/-Semaj- got it.</TEXT>

Not saying that they aren't working hard enough, I'm just saying that statement is not exactly true. Most of everyone stayed an extra hour or so, but that parking lot was empty last night besides the two cars I normally would see when I drove by. I work in the same area.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I am not sure, I don't have a Twitter account so I'm not as up to date as everyone else is on the progress. That's about the same time I drove by last night and their lot seemed to be pretty empty so it makes sense. You would actually be surprised how many developers they have there. For as big as their market is, there is only a handful of developers working there which I think they could do with another two or so. They are a very small shop. With that being said though, these developers aren't cheap. They average $45-90 an hour depending on their specific technical skillets and experience.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I know I'm late, but I wanted to contribute anyway since I just remembered this. I'm telling this for a friend of mine who doesn't have Reddit. A few years ago he was on a road trip from New York to South Carolina. Somewhere in Virginia he decided to stop at a sports bar with my other friend who was a implanting him. He had one beer and some food and they were on their way. At this point it was about 11pm at night and they were back on the highway. Shortly after taking off he came up behind a line green Honda Civic which seemed to be driving erratically. Surely enough, a few minutes later the Honda hit the back of a motorcyclist at about 70mph and flung the rider right in front of my friends car and my friend ran right over the guy and killed him immediately. The Honda took off and was never caught, my friend was given a DUI (or OUI) I can't remember which and was charged for involuntary manslaughter because he had alcohol in his system when it happened. He blew a .02. He lost his license for a year, I never bring up the story or ever ask him questions about it because I know it was a very traumatic experience for him.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You fucking minorities are the most racist people I've ever met. And yet you're the first ones to cry "racism" blah blah blah. Im a minority myself and I don't have a problem with law enforcement, you know why? Because I FUCKING FOLLOW THE RULES. Dumbass, I'm sick and tired of people like you. I was born and raised in a foreign country, I'm a Hispanic male, never had an issue with the law, I lived in the hood or ghetto, whatever the F you want to call it, got shitty grades just like any other stupid high school minority in my area and did stupid things just like stupid kids do growing up. Did I ever get assaulted by a police officer? Hell no! You know why? Because I listened to them and respected them. You fucking people are so entitled. The world owes you nothing! One minority gets shot and it outrage! Why was he breaking the law in the first place? Fucking scum! Edit- another thing, you know why you don't see enough black or Hispanic police officers? Because they don't take the test, therefore they don't make it to the academy and ultimately don't become police officers. People want to cry about why there are so many white cops everywhere, well shit, why don't minorities start taking the damn test then? Last I checked, there is nothing written anywhere that stated a black man can't be a police officer. So why don't more black people and Hispanics become police officers? Answer that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm pretty sure you can get a DUI for less than a .08, some people have different tolerance levels, someone might have one beer and only blow a .05 and feel a bit tipsy because of it if the person doesn't drink much. It's still considered driving while impaired or a DWI. So many terminologies I don't remember which one exactly he was given.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm sorry about my previous reply. I didn't mean to curse, it's just that I see that reaction way too often amongst the people I call my friends, and these guys all follow the law, so in my personal opinion I feel that if you follow the law, there should be no reason to think of law enforcement that way. I understand that there are rogue cops out there, I have been in situations where I was red hot furious because a cop had been an asshole to me for no damn reason, heck it makes me mad just honking about it, but you know what? I don't hate all of them for it. I've grown up wanting to be in law enforcement my whole life, and I want to be an officer so that I can give people a reason to smile or a second opinion. So I apologize for that comment, as I was reading it, I was picturing some stupid people that I used to know.</TEXT>

Does that mean that if I bet 400 on the underdog, I would only make $100? Or if I bet $700 on the favorite, I would only make $100 if they win?

    <TEXT>I wouldn't say rarest, because a lot of people in the military get to experience it, but when I was in Afghanistan, I had an F-15 take off and literally fly about 15 feet above my head on full afterburner. The heat was intense! He was taking off and once the wheels went up, he stayed pretty low to the ground until he got to the end of the runway, which is where I happened to be running past at that point on a dirt path just past the end of it. It was pretty damn awesome, and loud.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I just left a job because of the environment. From experience, bigger environments tend to have higher turnover and less morale. The reason being, at least in my experience, you don't feel like you contribute much to the overall purpose of the company. I guess it was just my line of work, but I have worked in both small teams 4-5 people in an office, and we got along great and definitely felt like we could contribute (mostly because we HAD to) and as I stated, I worked in a very large environment with hundreds of people in the office. I did not like the larger environment, it definitely sucked the life out of me and it just felt like everyone was always trying to screw someone else over all the time. I had 5 offers two weeks ago and took 10k less for the smaller, more collaborative, team oriented environment. Because after 6 months, if you are not happy enough with your current role, you will be looking for another role again. I would go with what will keep you happy in the long term. Sure, money is always great, but happiness is greater IMO.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Funny thing, I always tend to be fairly quiet on comms, besides a good luck guys and that's about it. I never qualify because I find it more fun this way to drive through the pack. There is always this one guy in my truck races who always happens to end up in the same split as me and talks so much crap and complains about everyone else. It's so damn annoying. I've raced probably 25 total official races in the same split with this guy and so many people dislike him. 60% of the time he ends up wrecked out of the race (which he blames on everyone else but himself of course) and the other 40% he qualifies up front and finishes mid field. Just sad. I've never seen someone brag more about their skills and never get a win. He has his butt buddies too sometimes that just clog up the comms and go back and forth non stop all race long. GET A TEAMSPEAK AND SHUT UP! There is nothing I hate more than people constantly talking, especially when a yellow flag flies and I can't update the field on when to slow down for the pace car.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm not so sure I'm against this. I honestly like the close racing, I think it's more intense that way. Now don't light your torches and sharpen you pitchforks yet, guys. I think NASCAR has done some great things on the recent years, and has attracted a new fan base. Let's face it, it was definitely not the most popular sport in recent years, or even close to it. I was a die hard Mark Martin fan back in the day, then I stopped watching NASCAR because it honestly got boring to me around the time Mark left Roush Racing. If it wasn't for the chase format and now this, I don't think I would be watching it again. And a lot of you die hard fans might say "well heck, I'm never going to watch NASCAR again" but do you really mean that? I highly doubt it, guys. I'm being honest here, I was almost scared to even post this because I figured I would set down voted to oblivion with all the hate going around, but then I remembered, it's just fake internet points. My point is, NASCAR has been losing a lot of fans these past few years, and you may not notice but people like myself, that are from big cities, not the country can definitely tell. You just don't run into fans like you used to back in the day anymore and all this drama and craziness going on these past few months around the sport, that's what attracted me back. I may not be the majority, but heck I know I'm not the only one. I'm sure more people will become a fan of the sport than the amount that "leaves" if that is the case. Just my opinion. TL;DR- NASCAR is losing fans and needs to shake thing up. All the drama and the new formats should hopefully attract a broader fanbase.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was a military recruiter just fairly recently. It's amazing to hear the stories that those army guys get away with telling kids. I get it, not all of them are this way, but holy shit, I know more crooked army recruiters than I know good ones. I'm not going to say we were saints either, but the dumbest thing we ever do is allow a kid to go to MEPS with a potentially disqualifying factor and letting them know what the outcome is if they disclose that information. I never told anyone to lie at MEPS, but we definitely endured that the kid knows what will happen if they tell the truth. I even walked in on an army recruiter in the middle of a "speech" before a high school asvab, just as he was talking about how MY branch was paid less than any other branch and this guy was an E-7! Couldn't believe it. All I had to say to those kids was, YOU HAVE A SMARTPHONE AT YOUR HANDS. IF A RECRUITER TELLS YOU SOMETHING, YOU JUST GOOGLE IT. It's amazing the things they get away with telling kids, any recruiter that thinks it's a good idea to straight up lie to a kid is fucking stupid and will always come back to bite you in the ass.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You can, but even if your interview goes great, this may still lead the Hiring Managers to pass on you because if you are leaving for more money (and I get it, you're under-payed) what is to say that you wouldn't leave your next position in less than a year for more money again? In the Hiring Manager's eyes, they want someone who they know will benefit the company and will not be someone who they devote their time to training, and getting them up to speed only for that person to leave the company a few months later for a better paying position. Like some of the good comments on this thread, you can always say you are looking for a better environment, or an opportunity to enhance your skills. Or you can say you're looking for professional development and more opportunities. That would sound better than, "I'm looking for higher salary" -although you are being honest, sometimes you might get a pass even if you're a perfect fit for the position. Good luck on your search!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A lot of good comments on here except that one jackass. You should notify your new employer of the non compete policy. Normally, if you're staying within the same field and within 50 miles, they will even send you a copy of all the paperwork you signed. I recently received one from my former employer and they even sent it to my new employer and CC'd my CEO. Thankfully, I work in a small company (with less than 25 employees) within the staffing world so this thing happens all the time. It's just scare tactics and every single person that I currently work for has received one with only one guy being sued over it, legal battles over a year and then they just dropped the case because they saw that he wasn't backing down. If you want to avoid the legal issues, don't be like my coworker and reply with a hand written that says "kiss my ass, respectfully, coworker" TL;DR it's just scare tactics Edit- autocorrect</TEXT>

I honestly had no idea who she was at the time, but I pretended like I did. We exchanged phone numbers and she kissed me, and we talked for a few months.

    <TEXT>Some games are different than others, for example, if you run Crisis 2 on full graphics you'll average 20-35 fps MORE on DX9 than you would in DX11. But that's crisis, there are a few videos on YouTube that show this example. Luckily, Iracing will give everyone the option for running both. The ISR video is not the best example of this as they only show the relevant features of DX11, which I am VERY excited about. Speaking of which, do you know if we will finally be able to use the oculus rift in DX11?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well, at least you don't get booted because your name is Spanish. I'm probably the whitest Hispanic I know. Spent 8 years in the Marines and a US citizen and I still manage to get booted out of hosted sessions because my name is not Bob or bill or tom. It hurts sometimes. There are leagues that I've tried to join, but have been pending for ever, yet my good friends that have applied to these leagues have managed to get in successfully with lower irating and license class. I don't think there is anyone on Iracing that could say I've ever done anything bad to them. It's just the nature of it I guess, but yeah, like OP said, it is quite frustrating getting kicked for no reason. Even if you're a safe and good driver.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As a Hispanic, I'm still a fan of the sport. Me boycotting NASCAR for this is just silly. I get it, there's some racism that goes around, heck I got weird looks when I went to Charlotte a few years ago and someone overheard me speaking Spanish to my dad. People get way too butt hurt over everything now a days. We just want to protest everything. Well shit, if you don't like the way something is, then change your ways and do something about it instead of protesting and rioting. After reading over what I just wrote, I don't really know what I said here. But I do agree with you OP, it's not right and they're not making it any better for us minorities to enjoy the sport knowing what the public opinion is. It doesn't mean I am going to boycott NASCAR though.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey guys, I've had issues with my G27 in the past and I've taken it apart and have put it together thanks to some YouTube videos and it has worked fine ever since. I have come across another problem recently and I can't seem to fix it. No matter how many times I calibrate the wheel on the profiler and in Iracing, it still ends up doing the same thing. Issue- Iracing shows my wheel turning well over 180 #176; even if I'm only turning it about 90 #176; or so and it won't calibrate properly. So when I race, I only have to turn it slightly for it to do a huge turn on the sim itself. If I do a physical 90 #176; turn on the wheel itself, Iracing does a 180 #176;+ turn on there and will not calibrate properly. TLDR: the wheel won't calibrate properly and it's turning at a higher radius in the sim than I am physically turning it. You guys always come through for me, hoping you can do it again!</TEXT>

Again, it is ASA certified but the argument was from every team on the league against us.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Everyone has good points here, I am by no means an experts in giving any advice, but I'm sure as hell good at giving my opinion. Honestly if you're going to be working at a place where you dislike, how long will it be before you find yourself looking through indeed, monster, careerbuilder, LinkedIn or any other job finding site to look for a better opportunity? I had a great job last year but it was just killing me, they even paid me a 20k bonus to get me in there when I was initially hired. That should have been the first red flag for me. The fact that they were willing to give me such a big bonus to have me on their payroll should have definitely been a red flag. Although I took it because it was way higher than what I was making before. Long story short, it took me two weeks before I had started looking for new opportunities. Such a horrible environment. They paid me my bonus and someone reached out to me on LinkedIn about 5 months in and I never looked back. Took 20k less of a salary for a change of environment. Scenery is still basically the same, but they environment is way different. I love it here. Environment is a huge thing for me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As a former military recruiter, that just goes to show you how poor out education system actually is. My recruitment office was right across from one of the most populated high schools in the state, had [almost] the entire 11th and 12th grade classes take the ASVAB and only about 10% of both classes got above a 50 on the combined math an English portions. The other 90% were a 49 and below, with a significant amount of students below the military minimum of a 31 AFQT score. The baffling part of this is that this test has basically been unchanged for years, I remember it being quite easy when I took it well over 10 years ago. And now I have only seen homeschooled and private school kids get over a 95. Yes, you still have the rare 1's and 2's that go to good public schools that will score well, but either way, there is no reason that you can pass a state test to graduate high school, and NOT be able to pass the ASVAB.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's awesome news, to be honest. I used to watch NASCAR several years ago and stopped watching it when Mark Martin left Roush Racing. It just got boring. The new chase format and all of the drama at the end of last season is what brought me back, Haas' introduction to F1 also brought me into the F1 world this year. It would be awesome to see him get a good run at the Glen! PS- I know probably everyone will disagree with me on the whole nascar chase format. From what it looks like, it seemed to be a very unpopular move with the current fans. But in my opinion, it worked. Because I don't miss a single race now.</TEXT>

It's at the point where every party is basically involved because nobody is held accountable. It's just sad and a disgrace. I lived there for ten years before I came to the states, I served as a US Marine here, did my time, busted my ass and worked myself into upper middle class and have not looked back. No desire of ever going back there. It's like everyone there complains about everything but do nothing about it to fix the situation because "nothing is going to change". The mindset of the whole country is basically "sit around and wait for handouts" and "wait for the road to pave itself"</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Everyone makes a good point as to why not to shorten them and as to why shorten them. I honestly think they should either shorten them to 3 hours, or maybe even start counting all of them in kilometers. I live in an area where not many people grow up being nascar fans and the biggest gripe everyone has about nascar is that "it's too long". This is what I really like about Formula1 is that I can wake up two hours before Sunday morning softball and catch almost the entire race before I have to step out of the house. Two hours would get me just over half way in the average nascar race. I love NASCAR, I do, but I wouldn't be opposed to having a kilometer instead of a 500 miler. We don't have to change the names, just the length of the races between miles and kilometers. What are your thoughts on this?</TEXT>

Although /r/Iracing can be a bit of a cult, I think you will always find people in different subs that will say one sim is better than the other. This even includes the forza and granturimo subs as well. As for me, the best experience I have ever had was Iracing with the oculus rift. Nothing comes close to that unless you're out on a real track, though. And that could be said for any sim or racing game.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As a recruiter who specifically works with financial institutions, I would certainly go with the second offer. By all means, the finance sector is great, and you can get paid a lot of money for having expertise in several different lines of businesses, but the financial institutions are based on the stock market. Well, all businesses are in some way shape or form, BUT I mean heavily based on it. So if for some reason China does something bad one day, this can totally affect your job. This happens a lot with bigger companies as well, your firm didn't do so well last quarter? No bonus for you! Numbers are declining? Start working on your resume! This is merely the one of the CONs of working for financial institutions, a good friend of mine, which I happened to place at a financial institution is a data analyst working with heavy SQL and he loves it there, but after 4 years, he is still making the amount of money he was before. The only thing keeping him there is the great work/life balance. 40 to 50 hours a week, and you can work from home up to two days a week? Oh yes! This is just my opinion from personal experience, OP. Proceed as you will! And best of luck.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's very interesting, well as for the first role, it's a niche role, meaning people with your experience will be hard to come by, therefore also hard to get rid of you if you're doing all the right things, along with that, it will be a bit tougher to find a job like that if you all of a sudden are let go or want to get up and have a change of scenery. As for the second role, account executive types of roles tend to give a big potential to make a lot of money, this of course depends on how hard you work, obviously. Although there are many different types of account executives, the only types I am familiar with deal with sales or business development and if that's the case, get ready to be very numbers driven, meeting goals, deadlines and other types of little things that are scrutinized if you're not meeting your goals. Again, this is my opinion, I would certainly have to look at the job descriptions to get a better feel for what exactly they expect you to be doing. But I hope whatever you chose, works out for you!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Totally off topic, but I wanted to let you know just in case. Make sure you contact your previous insurance and make sure they did not send a notice to your DMV to revoke your plates. I've seen this happen WAY TOO OFTEN. This means that you can drive by any police car and you can get pulled over for having what's called an "insurance lapse" and get your car towed away. none of this can happen, of course, if you cancelled your former insurance AFTER your new policy was in place.

    <TEXT>Your comment just doesn't make any sense. There's nothing that can happen in that intersection to make it the cops fault. If you have a stop sign, you stop. It's THAT type of statement from people like you who always seem to find something wrong with Law Enforcement officials. So what are you implying? Are you implying that if he wasn't a cop he wouldn't have been at fault for the woman running the stop sign? I didn't call you any names. It just irks me when people have that type of mentality.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A lot of great comments on here, but another thing I'd like to add, you have to race the track, not the cars around you. If you find yourself burning through your tires faster than the guys around you, it's because you're worrying too much about them. Drive like they weren't there and find the best racing line for you. I don't have as many wins as you, but I used to average a top 3 finish in almost every race once i started doing this. After a while you start to see that on longer runs, those guys will start coming back to you. Good luck bud!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have not been on for the past week, but everything was fine until I got in today and downloaded the most recent update that iRacing had delivered. With all this being said, I jumped in to a quick pickup cup session to get a quick race in and there was quite the amount of stuttering going on. Not only this, but it also looked like the cabin inside the truck was filled with smoke. I did mention it to iRacing support, and also suggested adding smoke inside the cabin when there's a fire while I was at it, because it do look pretty damn cool. Anyone else having these stuttering issues with their DK2? Or any other VR headsets after the update?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I am on the same boat right now, bud. In my last 20something races, I have yet to finish in the top 5 more than once. It all comes with consistency and how often you are out there actually racing. If you are like me and don't get much time on the track until you find yourself with an hour of spare time, then the only practice you get is the practice session before the race and maybe a YouTube video real quick to see the track layout and braking points and hope that you can memorize them by the time your qual run starts. What I've realized is that, if you're not out there constantly putting laps in, you are not going to be as consistent. Another thing is, don't worry about trying to keep up with the guys ahead of you or try to keep those other guys behind you, just race your line and worry about you. I was so worried about being fast that I tried to pace myself off the guys in front of me and I just always ended up spinning out or running into a wall or crashing into someone because I had a lapse of concentration and missed a braking point and ran into a guy. (Shit happens) in the past two months, I've lost my oval A and Road C licenses, and have gotten them both back within a week. So I just ask myself, how come I can manage to race clean and stay on track when I'm attempting to get my license back? I don't know  #129300;, but that's the one thing I always end up saying to myself when I wreck out in Every. Single. Race... trust me, bud, you're not the only one on hard times. Just worry about finishing in one piece instead of on the podium at first. Best of luck!</TEXT>

We currently use the Corcoran jump boots for the academy and have the option of wearing those in my department, but I'd rather leave those nice and shiny for parades and special events. (As suggested by one of our instructors) I have seen some of the guys wearing the Under Armor ones and trying to break those in during DT training, but Amazon doesn't show very great reviews on them. Any suggestions for a great work/shoes? If it means anything, I'm a size 14 in Men's. (US)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hahah that's too funny! I once had my dog poop on my foot while I was in the middle of the brickyard 400. I was so immersed in the race (running too five, too.. which rarely happens with me anymore) and I didn't hear him crying because he needed to go out! About ten minutes later, a weird smell caught my attention, I looked around and sure enough, as I moved my foot, there it was! I wasn't even mad.. funny story about that race, though. With about 20 laps to go, I was leading the race after a caution and during the restart, the guy in 3rd place got a jump on me and literally tried to push me, ended up turning me into the second place car and causing a 30+ car pileup at the start finish line, he was the only one that got away, about 25 people left the race after that. Will never forget that race.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm late to the party and I haven't read any of the advice you got from everyone else but I'll give you my story. For the past year, I was in a nice and comfy office job with a wonderful penthouse view of the city making around 70k base salary and about 80k on commission (I'd like to think I was really good at my sales job, but really I got a lucky and made a ton of money with the right opportunity) with all that being said, I was unhappy. After spending 8 years in the Marines, I couldn't keep myself in an office job, I felt locked up and caged in. It felt like I was in the "Groundhog Day" movie. I was literally waking up every day to do the same thing over and over again and expecting different results all the time. Just not my cup of tea. I needed unpredictability and a job that I could be proud of myself and be a part of a team again. So I jumped ship and found the right opportunity that I love, got a call back and took it on the spot. Now I make 50k base with no commission and I couldn't be happier. TL;DR- Went from making close to $160k to $50k and couldn't be happier. It doesn't matter how much money you make if you're in an unhappy situation, you can only go so long without happiness and being miserable before you break. You have to love what you are doing, or at least like it in some way. If you wake up every morning looking forward to going to work, that's when you know you're in the right job. Best of luck!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi all! I've had three or four front page posts in my reddit history, most recently the "thanks Obama" that was the highest rated one on /r/pics for a while (not sure if it still is), but my post Karma on my account hasn't moved over 14k for several years now. Can someone help?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>to be honest, I still dont really fully know, I just noticed that it wasnt adding up because I had several people PM me throughout the past week about it, but apparently its not 1:1.. I guess if you get enough karma, you are eligible for certain Reddit benefits (the only one of which I know of so far is access to the /r/eliteclub subreddit.. which seems to be like a ghost town anyway!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It amazes me that people complain about the "militarization" of police departments, but when shit goes downhill (and it goes downhill fast) everyone cheers when swat rolls up in the armored truck. I mean seriously, these are federal funds, if these departments don't use them, they lose them. Every department has annual funds from the feds that they receive, it's part of how your local department keeps running with up-to-date gear to keep officers current and the public safe. As much as people like to say "I pay your salary" well, without federal funds, you'd really have something to complain about when it came to paying taxes. As for the unmarked vehicles that you have been seeing, I personally believe it is merely a coincidence. There hasn't been a "spike" or anything in unmarked patrols or anything like that and departments don't do such things to "deter" would-be criminals. In most cases, specifically in the bigger departments like MSP, BPD, Quincy and even Transit Police, once you get to a specific rank or specialty, like sergeant or detective, to name a few, you get a unmarked cruiser. This doesn't always happen, but like I said, it's mostly in the bigger departments. It has nothing to do with "let's catch more people off guard so we can put more people in jail" I hope this helps.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So wait, if you were forced to work overtime, like what some of these departments do to their officers, wouldn't you want to get paid for your overtime work? Also, most overtime pay comes from the companies that support whatever events needs the overtime/detailed officers. So it's not like there's a huge giant fund just for overtime.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes, the fund is necessary for a police department to run properly. This money is spent on specific things like Kevlar vests, squad cars, training, weapons and overtime that police departments need to enable officers to do their job. Why do you need overtime as part of the funds? A perfect example is an event like Sail Boston. If by any chance you got the opportunity to get out and see the event throughout the weekend, you would have noticed the large police presence throughout the city. Now I don't know about you, but I'd rather have a large police presence in an event like that (which attracted well over 3 Million people) than to have no police presence at all. Unfortunately for you, not every citizen out there it out worrying about your best interests and if there is a large police presence in a crowded area, you better believe certain individuals will at least think twice before any wrong doing, and that includes major incidents as well. Police don't write tickets just to make their department revenue. It all goes to the state. The reason why you get a ticket and the price is set at a specific value is due to the general statutes. Certain companies that are involved in public safety also receive revenue this way which they are paid through "surcharges" via citations. It's a way to partially offset some of the cost of public safety. For example, off a $150 fine, $100 of that will be a surcharge that goes to state funds. The legislators use that money for things like education, domestic violence advocacy and conservation projects and general up-keep of the city streets and public ways. Your tax dollars pay for way more than just a "revenue generator", also police officers pay taxes too. I hope that explains a little better.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>See I just recently made the switch from Comcast to FiOS. Cable and internet, actually and to be honest, I made a mistake. The modem I received from Verizon was very weak, although a CAT5 wired connection is super fast through FiOS, unfortunately their wifi is not the best, or as good as they advertise it to be. The Comcast router I was using would give me a full strength signal through the whole house, while Verizon's modem would give me 3-4 bars of signal strength through most of the house unless I was sitting in the same room. Unfortunately for me, I made the switch back to Comcast. As much as I hated it before.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I did donuts for a couple of minutes one time until I hit 0% and got two flat tires as well. I kinda wish they added it as part of the damage model in regular races so that I could have something else to complain about after each race. Seriously though, how cool would that be? Is there any racing sim that accurately depicts that right now? Edit- switched "game" to "sim"</TEXT>

    <TEXT>People always ask me about my great starts, It's fantastic. Let me tell you about my great starts. I do very well with great starts. I love my great starts. No one loves great starts more than me, BELIEVE ME. My great starts love me. We're going to have so many great starts you are going to get sick of great starts. The my great starts just got 10 seconds faster. I have the best great starts. Ok, on a serious note, everyone here has made pretty good points, but one difference I make is that instead of hammering the gas all the way, I keep it at about 15-20% gas while holding the clutch and then full throttle when the lights go green. (Instead of red-lining, you'll be on yellow and shouldn't spin the wheels coming off the line) I haven't had a single race since I started doing this, in which I haven't gained at least two spots before the first corner. This, accompanied by a great reaction time, has gotten me several spots in the past. Just pray that you don't shoot through the middle if someone doesn't get going in time and you happen to run into someone else avoiding them. Try that! Best of luck!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Bro, there is absolutely no arguing with you, it seems. OBP is way more important than AVG. How is a walk not as good as a hit?! You get on base with a hit, great! Not every day that you get a hit, hell, even the best in the bugs are lucky to make it past a 6 game hit streak without luck, but if you can manage to walk as often as this guy does, it is equally important, if not even more important than getting base hits, either way, you're getting on base and providing the team an opportunity to get a run. A large majority of Judge's homers have been solo's, which explains why he has over 40HRs and less than 100rbis not too many guys getting on base ahead of him, this is why walks are important.</TEXT>

It really says a lot about a hitter, you can have a shitty average and a high OBP, I'll still take that as long as you're supporting the team. As for the advanced metrics, you have me beat there.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I believe an IROC series would be more popular than the other classic series. Thoughts?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-09-13 04:38:43</DATE>
    <TEXT>They would only have to add ONE car, The Pontiac Firebird Trans Am IROC (preferably the one they were running in 2006). It would be a fixed setup race, just like it was for the real guys, they wouldnt need to add any new tracks because they ran on current NASCAR oval circuits and it would be a great step in C class to go towards after Street Stocks. In my opinion. What do you guys think? Can we make this happen? http://www.gettyimages.com/event/crown-royal-iroc-series-race-february-17-2006-75128318?et=D6P5lTXcRDhBbFToyIjZKg amp;referrer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gettyimages.co.uk%2Fevent%2Fcrown-royal-iroc-series-race-february-17-2006-75128318#racing-action-during-the-2006-crown-royal-iroc-race-at-the-daytona-picture-id81604336</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In my opinion, the basic setup packages that these cars had was built so that not one car could run away on its own, kinda like what NASCAR TRIED to do with the COT, but this actually worked well and made for amazing racing. With these type of cars, you could hammer the gas all the way around the ovals in which they raced in. To be honest, it would basically be the carb cup that we have now, but in several different tracks and different cars. I think it would be a great addition, again, just my personal opinion.</TEXT>

They used to be really noticeable because they were gray in color but now are all brown. E- the spray is supposed to dampen the tracks to reduce noise.

    <TEXT>They do. Only reason you don #8217;t see the rust is because they are constantly being used. I work around them, any time it rains overnight you can actually see the oxidation beginning with a very thin coat of rust before the trains start going over them in the morning. You can see this in any of the construction projects in which they have the bus diversions, there is a thick coat of rust on the rails when they don #8217;t get used after a couple of days.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I use the i5 with an Oculus Rift and it works great (even if it's not recommend, I wasn't aware the i5 was not recommend for VR when I built my PC) but I can still run iRacing on full graphics and average 75 fps with it. The lowest I've ever gotten was about 30-35 fps and for some reason that always seems to be in turn one at Watkins Glenn on the first lap. i5 should be just fine!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The difference here is that this is NASCAR and not specifically cars that are purposed for road racing. What you don't understand is that oval racing is not as "fun" to the average crowd here or as popular. Heck, in some places you'd get made fun of for admitting you are a fan of NASCAR. I can gladly tell my friends I watch formula 1 and it won't be a big deal. NASCAR is just not as popular as it used to be in the late 90's and 4-5 hour long oval races definitely don't help that at all.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi friends, I searched the sidebar with no results, unless I just can't read correctly. My CV1 for some reason does not show any video when my monitor is connected, but if I start up my PC with the monitor unhooked, I get the white light on the headset and Oculus home works through the HMD. Can anyone help? I only use it for sim racing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I agree with everything you had to say except for the stock cars part. Only because I own the Ford Fusion and the Chevy. One thing I've noticed with the fusion, that doesn't happen with any other car is that it tends to have a really hard time staying in the draft on superspeedways like Talladega and Daytona. I've won about 20sumthin races (not sure what the exact number is) and at least 12 or so of those wins have come in both these tracks, most of them with the fusion, but sometime around the summer they had to do something to change the aero or power coming out of the fusions because that car no longer can stay in the draft. Doesn't matter what carb cup or official or hosted race I try it in, I just do not have this issue with the Chevy whatsoever. I can be in the middle of the pack in a fusion and I will slowly lose the draft now. It's also almost impossible to keep up with the field in the fusion. I don't know why, but it doesn't happen with the Chevy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes we did, I never said they were bad, I said they were spotty. Really good on most days, I #8217;ll admit that, but certainly questionable/untrustworthy in others with certain individuals, I guess we #8217;ll just completely forget about guys like Jaime Garcia, Tyler Clippard and Luis Cessa (Cessa who had the lowest ERA of the three with a 4.75) and a combined 11 losses and 1 win between the three of them. (Yes I understand the wins don #8217;t matter for these guys, but 11 losses between 3 pitchers in the pen? Too many for three guys) if you want to count the rest of the pen, not including the starting rotation, that #8217;s a total of 30 Losses from the bullpen from 19 guys, (now, that #8217;s not bad at all! For 19 guys! Come to think of it) But remember, 3 of them share 11 of those losses, that #8217;s pretty bad.</TEXT>

According to baseball-reference, our staff ranked 12th in the MLB last season, which pretty much puts us right about the middle. It ain #8217;t bad, but it ain #8217;t as great as the hype they got. Just my opinion. I think all the hype came because they were in the top 5 in the AL.</TEXT>

I went from being a straight up oval guy to being able to do the Sprint series and I gotta tell you, in my opinion, the Merc is VERY easy to drive. If I could compare it to two other cars I own, I would say it has the giddy up of the CTSV, but much much more forgiving than the Porche... It's actually so forgiving that I still find myself feathering the throttle more than I should be when coming out of a corner, I mean, with that car you can practically hammer it out of a corner and not lose it!

    <TEXT>Tony Gardner- First of all, Happy New Year to all of our members. We also want to sincerely thank you for your membership. We know that some members are always curious what is next in regard to development. We do try and share what we can when appropriate. Various factors may dictate when we start discussing development on xyz feature, upgrade or xyz content. We also might not exactly work on what you want as fast as you want, but keep in mind we are developing for many types of racing. The totality of all the  #8220;niches #8221; makes iRacing a much better and sustainable sim for everyone. We also believe action speaks louder than words and we are proud of what we accomplished in 2017. It would be too long for a forum post to cover everything we are working on nor can I talk about everything for various reasons. However, I can confirm a few of the larger projects in the works that we have already discussed publically and spill the beans on a new project. New graphical and physical damage model. Making great progress on this massive project and we are really excited about it. There are so many different parts to it but getting to the polish on many parts of it. We expect to move it into the testing environment in the coming months and shooting for a 2018 release but as usual no promises. Dynamic time of day/moving clouds/day to night. Working night and day on day to night and the goal is to release this year. New Tire Model Version. Already testing locally and we are excited about it, Dave Kaemmer to write about in the coming weeks. Again, should release this year. New Interface and User experience inside and out of the sim. The new app is now in beta, and members have access to it. The first giant step is to get the new design and application up and working with our new technology to include all the functionality and more of our existing website. We are almost there in that regard. We still have many plans once that happens so it will be a continued evolution over a long period of time. For example, we have much more we want to do when it comes to user-experience, this new system and app will allow us to do that. For example, we want to create an onboarding process for new members including getting them on track with some basic instruction, guided tours, more on-line help, better organization and much more. Ok, this will be a  #8220;shocker #8221; to some. We are working on AI/Artificial cars and in fact very far down the road with the project. In fact, we should release it this year as well. Hardcore folks take a deep breath. We are not straying even the slightest from our philosophy of trying to create the most accurate and detailed simulation we can along with the best head to head racing competition. This has been an isolated project being done by a small team and has not impacted any other development. However, having this feature will allow for many opportunities for members and for us to continue to grow. It will allow members to practice in a simulated setting before getting on track with real cars which is a good thing, especially for people new to sim racing. It will also allow for a more relaxed and fun format which will be a welcome addition from time to time for even hard-core members. Now you don #8217;t need to go to another racing game for AI. Ha Ha. It will bring in many new members who will use it as a stepping stone to head to head racing. It allows us to have a much more competitive demo option for potential new customers in various settings like trade shows or even on-line trials. At the end of the day, it is a huge feature and request in regard to the overall market. It will be a free addition to members and yet another option for you under your membership. If AI not for you, great, but you will still benefit. The work has helped improve our multiplayer net code and player car code which will be out on members about the time we launch AI. We also feel it will help novice drivers and again boost the overall service. Right now our plan is roll out options of one-off AI races along with a season-long  #8220;career #8221; in which you can build your own schedule/series. We have other plans as well down the road to increase the fun factor in regard AI. We likely will roll out AI for a large chunk of the racing including oval and road. Some cars and types of racing might be held back initially because of all the different variables we need to work out. For example joker laps and going over the jumps for GRC. There are many other things like that which we are working on now. The web development side of this is also significant and still much work to do there before we can roll it out. There will be a "difficulty" choice or  #8220;slider #8221; option. More information as we get closer will be available. Alright, well, this is getting long but much more in the works in terms of features and improvements. As far as content, working on multiple new tracks including road, oval, dirt and GRC and a complete redo of an oval track. Hopefully we will plug away on more tracks. Literally dozens of cars in the works in some form of production or licensing. Including many new road cars and updates to existing road and oval cars. We already shared working on LMP1 cars, you should have those as soon as the next season build. These cars are a lot of work to build! More to come on content and everything else as we move forward. I hope you liked the Chili Bowl Video. We are expecting another good year, and we hope you agree when the year is over. Thanks again!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I can imagine the Yankee management was probably sitting there thinking  #8220;if Cole gets through 3 solid innings, we can make a trade deal so he can get pulled from the game early if the bats are struggling"  #129300;. /s So Cole just showed that he can beat this potent lineup, or at least keep us quiet for a few innings. I think it would be a good idea to pick him up in a trade, because this may very well be the guy who wins against us in the playoffs if he gets picked up by another contending team. What do you guys think?</TEXT>
