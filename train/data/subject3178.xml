    <TITLE>I was really hoping for a campaign story from the central power's perspective as well as allies</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-10-26 04:58:44</DATE>
    <TEXT>Playing through the campaign was a little Hollywood, but overall pretty fun. A little short for my liking, but fun never the less. Now what I was hoping for were two campaigns allies and central powers. This war was the first of it kind with casualties being upwards of 6000 men/day. The only aggressors were the politicians and monarchs, the soldiers were the victims. I just find it a little bit of a let down to have the campaign to come down to a "good guys vs bad guys" story. There were so many stories from the trenches of both sides appealing to human decency. The novel All Quiet on the Western Front really paints a picture that the German soldiers were not these demonized Raiders the propaganda made them out to be but rather young men who were trying to serve their country like the allies. Maybe I'm seeing too far into the game than I should. What are your guy's thoughts?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[Main spoilers] Dany may have some trouble</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-12-11 07:16:13</DATE>
    <TEXT>So with Dany crossing the sea with her 100,000+ army, it dawned on me that an army marches on its stomach. That being said dothraki are mainly a cavalry force used to riding in open Plains and grass lands. When they arrive it will be the begining of winter in westeros. As mentioned in "A knight of the seven kingdoms", the water in Dorne can be scarce in the late summer, not enough to sustain 100k horses and riders. Then we look at high garden for aid right? But as I'm sure they didn't imagine to feed a whole army at the begining of a 10 year long winter so Dany might not be able to gather aid in the name of resources from them. As i mentioned it is the begining of winter and the Dothraki have no winter clothing to speak of. As its been said in the first book by Jorah, all the king would have to do is close the gates and wait for the Dothraki to starve as they have no siege weapons. Now she does have dragons, but at the same time if her army cannot adapt she won't be able attack much of anything. This has always been Russia's natural defence and I'm sure George R.R. Martin will not ignore the troubles of a winter invasion. What are your thoughts?</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;The only person looking out for your career is you. No one should ever "network" to keep their job. Contribute to your company and earn your wages instead of "networking" and pretending like you deserve to be there. It's a matter of work ethic and integrity.  gt;As far as a politician goes, what do you think the representative in a representative democracy is supposed to do instead of talking to their constituents? Guess? Okay let's take a few swings. Legalization of marijuna would be a start, which is now rumoured to happen in 2019. Election reform, which monsef has basically butchered and insulted canadains by telling us math is too hard. How about dealing with the .3% economy loss last quarter? Maybe he should be working to approve more oil sands projects/mining. Not to mention there hasn't been a full time job created since the liberals have taken office. The Healthcare deal with the provinces just fell apart, he may want to concidering he only made one deal with nova Scotia and called it good. When a party is elected to govern, that is their job. All trudeau's liberals have accomplished is the Paris climate accord (which will fall apart under trump), and raise a 65 billion dollar deficit within two years with foreseeable future of a balanced budget and lower taxes. So what is your MP for if not to take the general public's concern directly? As far as i know his constituents are in papineau. What is the prime minister going to accomplish by a national tour? He's "networking" rather than working, I'll have to agree.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Generally being in these programs requires that they not drink outside of the programs. This isn't just like a liquor watering hole, this is part of a treatment program. How is the enforced? If an alcoholic in the program carries on, we'll still need the same policing, same medical costs only we have a larger government essentially wasting tax dollars which could be spent on more useful things like infrastructure or academic grants.  gt;I mean, the point of social programs generally isn't that they'll turn a profit, but this one certainly reduces costs. There is a certain ism that comes to mind when you said that. In a real world it would be awesome if we could take from everyone and fix all societies problems, but that's simply not the case. There will always be alcoholics, and if you make it easier for drug addicts to be addicts you'll have more of them. People need to have personal responsibility for their actions. You can say it saves money but yet there is no evidence to support your claim. Giving alcoholics booze every hour would only support further dependence on government welfare.</TEXT>

No what typically happens is you are indentured as a first year apprentice. You won't be able to use your own power tools, but at the same rate, why would you want to? Depends what country/union local you're in but you should see an increase in wage, Benefits, rrrsp contributions, and a pension in some locals. Also you should expect safer work practices and free training. Downside is union dues working/non working, some people are protected when they should be fired.</TEXT>

He asked who did it while starring at the guitar. Then he went scarlet red and smashed the guitar on the ground. He then began cursing and saying "fucking kids!!...etc.... then he cleared his desk, threw a beaker at the wall and left. There was like an hour left of class and he legit just left the school.

    <TEXT>Okay so 424 hasn't had work for a while and the list is rather large. I'd hold off on union membership for maybe another few months. In regards to travel, another local has to call out to work for other locals before you can work in their jurisdiction. So say there is a big call out in Washington, the first people at the top of the list would get first pick and then they'd have to apply for work visas and such. The process could take a long time and by the time the call the job could be over sort of thing. So if your local can't find work for you they may allow you to 'salt', which is work non union in the attempts to organize or promote the ibew in a positive Manor. But you can only salt within your jurisdiction with your own local's support. If you cross union borders, you have to get permission from your local and the local your working in to work non union. Dues in my local are $42/mo for non working (you have to pay them no matter what) and working dues are like $78 or something per paycheque. But you only pay them when working. I'm not sure how 424 does their dues but I'm sure it's similar. I won't say my local but It's near 424 and I haven't had work in 2 years and I've been paying dues for little to no benefit with a lot of headache towards salting. I have seen guys get name requested job to job with no break while the rest of us have been going in debt. I'm concidering leaving the hall if work doesn't pick up even though I beleive the union is a good thing. It's up to you whether you join now or later but if I were you I'd probably just join when the economy is a little better.</TEXT>

In the show they have him butcher a stag himself which would be a task easily given to someone beneath his tank but he decides to do it himself. He has an admirable quality of leadership but for myself that's where it ends becuase he has no honour. He could easily be compared to Roose Bolton. Tactical mind, ruthless to his enemies, and uses every political action to bolster their house in a better position. He's not cut and dry but certainly a great character.</TEXT>

The new way to defend liberal ideologies isn't to win debates or show progress, it's to suppress different ideas and label anyone who thinks differently a racist, zenophobe who should be publicly harassed or shamed. You wonder why more people are identifying with conservative polotics these days when someone can't even attend a university and have a differing opinion. I understand this is an opinion piece, but this whole article is basically a smear campaign against right wing political views. They take the most racist offensive posters they can find and say this is conservatism. If it were the other way around with *alarming rise of left wing views campus*, it'd never be published.</TEXT>

It's certainly not my views of Sikhs as I grew up in a predominantly Sikh neighborhood. But that just speaks to the level of intelligence of the people you're dealing with, right? The thing is, this new wave of left wing extremism is often the same shade of intelligence just with a different banner. National socalism and communists will often fly under the liberal banner. That being said not every liberal wants communism or national socialism. There were 4 "BLM activists" in Chicago who kidnapped a mental challenged kid, tortured him for 48 hours and released him. I mean we could also say that BLM is a white hate group becuase of that. This is the kind of logic the author uses. I don't exactly agree that there is a "conservative subculture" rather a group that doesn't beleive in liberal values or conservative values but Flys a conservative flag.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There has always been wealth inequality and there will always wealth inequality. The beautiful thing about a democratic capitalist society is that anyone can amass wealth if they are smart enough to do so. I am very aware of communism, and I am also aware that every country that adopted communism never had a democratic society before hand. They either had monarchies or outdated empires which **actually** oppressed people with class and surf hood. In a capitalistic society everyone determines their level of wealth to their own ability.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;That doesn't mean we should let it spiral out of control. Okay which capitalist society is spiraling out of control? Where is the huge conflict? A Wallstreet sit-in in 2011 that accomplished nothing but a contribution to the garbage dump?  gt;You'd have to be beyond exceptionally skilled or extremely lucky to go from poverty to wealth. Again if someone is smart enough to do so and no the majority of people aren't that smart. Ask someone off the street who the first prime minister of Canada was, you'll most likely get a blank stare but they sure as hell know the Kardashian names. My point was In a capitalistic society everyone has equal opportunity and choice written in the law. There are no more lords, kings, emperors, cast system to hold people back from rising to greatness. Sure, there are difficulties in life like being raised in a poor economic area or having a mental or physical disability but there currently no law saying that someone has to be a poor servant.  gt;You must either be an ancap or a libertarian, since no sensible person would dismiss increasingly worse wealth inequality with excuses like "anyone can get rich." Libertarian? An cap? As much as I appreciate the compliment I'm neither. Those are both ideologies with some good points but just like communism, they'd never work. I'm just an unconcerned citizen/skeptic. I don't believe there is this huge wealth inequality issue as there has always been one. If there are too many poor people it's becuase too many people haven't thought of anything to contribute to society that would deem them worthy of a higher wage. I repeat, there is no law from stopping people from getting good grades, taking out a student loan or a business loan and succeeding except for themselves. Please explain how capitalism opresses people?</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Wealth inequality is more like a boiling frog than an outright conflict. The people being affected by it the most don't notice its incremental changes until it's too late. So in other words, there is none.  gt;We "technically" do. But obviously that is not true. Yes it's called the Canadain Charter of Rights and freedoms  gt;If American and Canadian protection laws are anything to go by, you're quite wrong. Which laws, exactly?  gt;How naive and arrogant can one be to believe that everyone is stupid and lazy if they're poor. You claim there are no kings or lords, but you sure do act like one with your snobbish, condescending attitude towards the poor. Well for one Socrates once said "when the debate is lost, slander becomes the tool of the loser", and I believe it applies here. I don't look down on poor people, those are your words, not mine. If I'm wrong, why is there more more servers than doctors by a large margin? Why is there more fast food workers than engineers? Some others have more drive or natural talent that enables them to succeed in life over others. Some people are happy making a lower wage and have no desire for more income. No one drives around in blacked out vans and pushes people down if they are doing well, it just doesn't happen.  gt;Please, I'm not a communist but even I can explain how it and nations with the system can oppress people. Well you've failed to do so two times in a row so a third shouldn't be that much of a surprise I suppose. So please "flabergaste" me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Intellectual property laws, for one. It's a restriction on open enterprise with the purpose of retaining the wealth of a group. So people shouldn't get paid for their ideas and allow others the reproduce and make money off someone's else's achievements? Doesn't that oppress the person with the idea?  gt;The idea that one can lose a debate in an online forum is ridiculous. There is nobody judging for a winner or loser other than our own perceptions. So what do you hope to achieve out of this exchange? You may as well punch in random characters while you're at it if it truly means nothing.  gt;Ask someone off the street who the first prime minister of Canada was, you'll most likely get a blank stare but they sure as hell know the Kardashian names." "If there are too many poor people it's becuase too many people haven't thought of anything to contribute to society" Yes I did say those things and I did not say poor people are stupid and lazy, you did. I simply pointed out that some people give a shit to get ahead in life and others don't. Others are born gifted and others aren't. No one is oppressing anyone but themselves. Thanks for pointing out the obvious? You realize you have just agreed with my argument that there is no oppression, right?  gt;Do I have to quote the atrocities of nations like America It was actually a British colony on behalf of a constitutional monarchy. Most of the atrocities committed were becuase of the belief of manifest destiny from fundamentalist Christians. In fact it was actually imperialism run, not capitalist run.  gt;French atrocities to the slaves of Haiti Again another monarch colony which was government funded imperialists.  gt;You may not call yourself an Ancap, but you're rhetoric on the infallibility of capitalism sure makes you sound like one. Call me what you like darling, it still doesn't change the fact wage inequality is a major issue as your main argument has been "really I have to tell you?" So please get back to me with some factual data that capitalism is running rampant and guys in blackout vans are finding poor people becoming successful and pushing them down to the curb.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Most elections in this country are won with less than fifty percent of the popular vote Although the vote is always around 45-50%, it really counts as a full sample of the population as who ever does not vote really forfeits their right to have say. Most people don't really give a shit or they aren't educated enough to know who to vote for. Could you imagine if 90% of people voted? Who ever had the "coolest commercial" would win. Why would every wildrose jump PC? I'm saying the PC lost a ton of their supporters to wildrose which essentially let the NDP surpass both parties. I'm not saying the NDP shouldn't have won, I'm saying that if not for the Redford scandal, Alberta would most likely be a PC. If you think the NDP will form government next election, you are in for a shock.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>PSA: Wrap it up and never beleive "I can't get Pregnant"</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-01-18 06:49:00</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hey gents, I came across this podcast with Stefan Molyneux where this guy fell for this deceitful woman's trap by saying "I can't get pregnant". So first off this poor schmuck is in his late twenties, high paying job, stable career, and single. He meets the 35 year old woman who can't get pregnant becuase of ovarian cysts. He isn't really in to her besides the sex. He decides it's not going anywhere and decides to just be friends. She invites him over to hang out and she pussy bombs him by dropping her towel at the door. She invites him into her hottub and he fucks her afterward. So a month down the road, she calls him and tells him the 'unthinkable', she's pregnant. Furthermore, she's keeping the "miricle" baby. There were so many warning signs not to get involved with this woman that Stefan goes over with him like how she has no career, 35, just met her and she's willing to take a strangers semen willingly...etc... So now he's stuck with this woman who's past her prime and stuck paying for a kid he never intended on having. So besides the risk of STI's, the moral of the story is never take a woman's word for it. "I have low fertility", "I can't get pregnant", "I'm on the pill", these are all lines woman use to potentially make you their golden egg. Don't take the chance, wrap it up.

    <TEXT>A decomposing corpse going unnoticed in an HVAC system of a school is unlikely as the air would circulate everywhere and someone would eventually be called to find the problem. Or if the buildings airflow were obstructed etc... a cranny? Possibly.  gt; It made more sense to me than the idea that his stepmother decided to get rid of him The gardener had said that she had approached him asking him if he wanted to kill her husband for her 5 months prior. What would the gardener have to gain from letting the police know that? I think the stepmother had a few screws loose. I beleive she made him take a bunch of pills, and threw his unconscious body in the ocean or a river. Then she probably posted his picture to fb out of regret or to try and bolster sympathy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I would agree with you that a mod shouldnt re approve their own comments. That really opens up the can of worms doesn't it? Should mods be able to participate in conversations as well as mod them? Is it really an open playing field if your batting against the umpire? It seems logical to beleive the text above is legitimate, or else OP is deranged and has a lot of time on their hands. I feel a lot of the time meaningful discussion is banned at the will of the mod and not to the spirit of the rule. Like I said, I found OP's comment to be dead wrong but I'd like to have the chance to discuss why they are wrong. But the mod in question removed the ability for that to happen. The conversation slowly gets herded into a corral where certain sentence structures need be maintained in order for it to be "substantive". As we can see we don't exactly have an agreement on the rules so it's basically to what ever mod you are dealing with.</TEXT>

All sources of fresh water will be contaminated with radio active material. There will be no war to fight becuase there will be no one left to fight for. Sure a few select groups will survive for six months to a year but all life except for roaches will survive.

    <TEXT>I remember watching Ken Burn's "The War" and an American soldier was speaking to a captured S.S. soldier. The S.S. asked the American where he was from. I think he said Indiana. He S.S. asked what town. The American replied some small town you'd have never heard of it. The German then began to tell him "Oh such and such County? There is a nice waterfall there right past..." or something to that effect. The American soldier then said it then dawned on him that Hitler had invasion plans for North America and wanted select soldiers prepared. I'm paraphrasing big time and I can't remember which episode but I'm sure the information exists. This will be a good excuse for me to re watch the series.

    <TEXT> gt;Pretty sure it goes beyond virtue-signalling if you're actively trying to do your job You use the term job quite loosely there...  gt;I'd suggest finding a new phrase to parrot for anything you don't like. I have a lot of phrases for things I don't like but virtue signaling fits perfectly. OP has done nothing but run around and complain at a bunch of places with no real solution to the problem. The only thing OP accomplished was going on reddit and looking for 'pats on the back' from people like yourself to justify this behavior. So virtue signaling is the correct term.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Probably going to get down voted into oblivion but seriously, what's the difference between the rebel asking for donations to cover travel costs and CTV running an add between shooting coverage? He wasn't trying to "make money" off the shootings. If you read the letter he was asking his supporters to help cover the costs of traveling to Quebec and hotels etc... The Rebel is a small outlet, it's not like the CBC where there is a local outlet in every region of the country. I don't think it is unreasonable as they do run a subscription service and the people he was asking are already paying for his content. Really though, every media outfit does this in the form of commercial advertising.</TEXT>

But to protest Leitch for the killing of the 6 men is completely bullshit. Islamic terror is a real threat to Canadains and if you look at the past ten years there have been over ten major Islamic terror plots in Canada thwarted, multiple citizens leaving canada to fight with isis, and two successful attacks which almost resulted in the shooting of the prime minister at the time. Leitch isn't calling for concentration camps, or murder, her platform is more strict screening of refugees.</TEXT>

People get in at their own will and what do you know, not only does it not fly, it murders people. Hundreds of people. People start catching on and saying "hey that's not a flying machine" but I keep professing and telling people that my design is infallible and it's the operator's error. The murders are only a small design flaw. If I operate it, no one will be murdered".

It is a real issue and you can say "Oh it's racist" but the stats don't lie.

    <TEXT>No I get what your saying but the responsibility level and training of an engineer is way more than a secretary. See when someone is hired, it's not what they can do for you, it's what you can do for them. "How can you make me money?" Is what the employers say when hiring a candidate. Your brother is competing against people with years expirience and possibly higher education (managment courses...etc). Taking on someone fresh out of school is more/less an investment as the employer has to train the employee and look over their work more carefully. $39,000 won't be the wage for very long, but still everyone has to start somewhere. What I'm trying to say is that's not a bad starting wage for a career with a large pay scale. Where as a secretary at $39000 is basically maxed out.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Look at arts grants for example. Many TV shows filmed in Canada would move to other countries if that funding was cut There is a big differnece between grants, tax credits, and annual funding that is budgeted for. However if you accept a grant, it's typically a one time occurance to help get a not for profit started, or something deemed beneficial to society. Tax credits are used to incentive businesses to help bring jobs into Canada for Canadians. If the government has to budget 1.5 billion annually for them, it's not an annual grant, it's an extension of the government and people who who accept the money are government employees.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes, it does. Let's say I open up a lemonade stand in the name of Canadain heritage. My lemonade isn't that great, I overpay my employees, and everytime I open up a new stand I need government funds to support it. I mean this clearly isn't a business. It's a wasteful extension of government siphoning tax dollars from citizens. Now I can say I'm giving people jobs, but I'm actually costing people jobs because I'm producing an inferior product and driving away competition becuase of unlimited funding from irresponsible government spending, all for a "made in Canada" stamp. So replace lemonade stand with bombardier and you'll find your answer. They have an awful business model that wouldn't be able to stand on its own. Any business that relies on government funding everytime they embark on a new venture is not a business, it's an extension of government.</TEXT>

It's money that people pay toward the government and the government allots me a certain amount for my services. No way am I a government employee. This is what I'm seeing when you say that. The funds come from the tax payer, plain and simple. If you take a wage from the government, you are employed by the government and therefore a government employee, which is not necessarily a bad thing as the public does require services. To say "they aren't government employees" is a fallacy becuase they are in fact employed by the government and without government funds, they wouldn't have a job.</TEXT>

I personally know of a guy who nearly decapitated a man with a machete outside a dairy Queen in Prince George BC, he was sentenced to 13 years in prison and was out in 4. I mean that's the reason why the conservatives tried to push minimum sentences so hard. Judges weren't sentencing to the satisfaction of the people. Like I said before, it really depends what crime you want to drop a minimum sentence for.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There is a book they sell at home depot called residential wiring for homeowners, or somthing to that effect that is excellent as it refers to code and teaches you how to do simple wiring methods. Take a read through and see if you're competent enough to take a stab at it.

    <TEXT>The reason why we have laws instead of rules is becuase laws are subject to change. Why would we hold the ability to form parliment if the people cant determine the way the country is governed? It isn't American Idol, it's the Democratic process. [Take this case for example](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Zachary_Turner) This woman murdered her boyfend in the US while pregnant and fled to Newfoundland where she was from. She then was arrested and was held before her sentence for six months. The judge saw her as only a threat to her boyfriend and released her on bail. She then murdered her infant son and committed suicide. Had a mandatory order for bail conditions been in place, that child would still be alive. Like I said before, I'm not for all mandatory minimums, but I think some are essential becuase in some cases there is no justice. Now I don't trust RCMP as far as I can throw them but typically in homicide cases like the one I referenced in the previous comment, the police did their job correctly and the courts failed to provide justice.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't agree with everything he says but he does offer factual based arguments. Basically what I had taken from the truth about slavery video is that the BLM movement was using slavery as an excuse to prosecute and deliver racism toward white people for past actions. Stefan then provided sources in history that basically stated that it's a ridiculous argument to want extra rights over other people for past oppression. Forgive me, it's been a while since I've seen it but I think that was the gist. He's far from a racist actually. I'm not sure about any weird cult as I just did a quick Google search and came up with nothing.

This is a prime example of candian justice. You can count on the RCMP to wait at the bottom of that hill in your town where the speed limit abruptly changes 20km/hr slower just to nail you to the wall for speeding, but murder hundreds in a terror plot and suddenly they don't want to be too rash... I realize the differnece between a court's ruling and an RCMP doing their job. But a guy who was deemed high risk 3 years ago to take part in group based violence and also built a bomb to murder hundreds can walk the streets freely is beyond my reasoning.</TEXT>

Literally nothing you do will change the mind of the liberals. You can claim "awareness", but it's really just complaining without a solution. Here's a tip: maybe if a person researched an ER platform they liked and started promoting it themselves through social media, their mp, or even on cbc radio.

Yes it does  gt;(b) condemn Islamophobia and all forms of systemic racism and religious discrimination and take note of House of Commons #8217; petition e-411 and the issues raised by it; This could mean that writting a cartoon of Mohammed is now Islamophobia. There is no clear definition. Charlie hebdo? Or racist? It depends on the definition and when this passes, any action as such can be recorded as Islamophobia.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>With a broad definition for this survey, literally anything could be collected as hate speech/racist language as the definition is open ended. The drawing of mohammed, openly critcizing the niqab, speaking ill of the quran, all could be a islamiphobic act. This could potentially lead to binding arbitration based upon this survey. Define Islamophobia and there will be no issues.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Might mean? Could mean? I don't know, you don't know, and that's the problem. This is a non binding motion to survey Islamophobia in Canada. Once the findings of the survey are reported, binding arbitration can be used to make recommendations. Why is this a problem? It's a problem becuase as of now any act opposed to Islam could be considered hate speech. If the survey finds a mass amount of "Islamophobia" in the survey, it could mean severe consequences to free speech based on flawed data. This is all becuase of the open ended definition of Islamophobia.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Islamist Extremists December 14, 1999 - Ahmed Ressam, known as the Millennium Bomber, was arrested upon entering the United States by a ferry from Victoria, British Columbia. He was smuggling explosives in his car from Canada as part of a plot to bomb the Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) on New Year's Eve 1999, as part of the foiled 2000 millennium attack plots. April 2004 - A Canadian Muslim of Lebanese descent firebombs the library of the United Talmud Torahs Montreal Jewish school. 2006 - In the 2006 Ontario terrorism plot, Canadian counter-terrorism forces arrested 18 terrorists (dubbed the "Toronto 18") inspired by al-Qaeda. They were accused of planning to detonate truck bombs, to open fire in a crowded area, and to storm the Canadian Broadcasting Centre, the Canadian Parliament building, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) headquarters, and the parliamentary Peace Tower, to take hostages and to behead the Prime Minister and other leaders. August 2010 - Misbahuddin Ahmed of Ottawa was arrested (later convicted in July 2014) of knowingly facilitating a terrorist activity and participation in the activities of a terrorist group.[10][11] 2013 - Chiheb Esseghaier and Raed Jaser of Montreal and Toronto, respectively, charged as part of an alleged Al Qaeda plot to derail a New York to Toronto train on the Canadian side of the border. Alleged plot was not imminent.[citation needed] Canadian Muslims helped to foil the alleged plot.[12] The suspects said they were arrested based on their appearance.[13][14] 2013 July 1 - Police announced the arrest of a Surrey man and woman on terrorism-related charges in a plot to detonate pressure cooker bombs outside the Legislature July 1. John Stewart Nuttall, whose lawyer described him as a convert to "Islam", and neighbours told reporters the two lived simply and listened to Islamic recordings.[15] October 20, 2014  #8211; On October 20, 2014, two Canadian Forces members were hit by Martin Couture-Rouleau, a recent Muslim convert in what is known as the 2014 Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu ramming attack. Warrant officer Patrice Vincent died of his injuries. Couture-Rouleau was eventually gunned down and killed. October 22, 2014 - Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, a convert to Islam, fatally shot Corporal Nathan Cirillo, a Canadian soldier on ceremonial sentry duty at the Canadian National War Memorial in Ottawa, and then forced his way into Canada's parliament building, where he had a shootout with parliament security personnel. He was shot 31 times and died at the scene. Zehaf-Bibeau made a video prior to the attack in which he expressed his motives as being related "to Canada's foreign policy and in respect of his religious beliefs." August 10, 2016 - Aaron Driver was killed in Strathroy, Ontario, in a confrontation with police after detonating an explosive in the back seat of a taxi. The confrontation followed a tip from the FBI that Driver had made a "martyrdom video" and was planning an attack on an urban area.[16] https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism_in_Canada</TEXT>

However no one held a gun to their head, they weren't being threatened, and all it took was an idea presented to them. This goes back to the old saying "if your friend jumped off a bridge, would you do it too?"

If you come out of university and can't find a job you've either picked the wrong career or aren't willing to relocate to get expirience.

    <TEXT>Would you want to chance it though? What if a family had forged documents or the mother is convicted of murder or the the father was a child predator and the family is fleeing from justice somewhere? The likelihood is low but it would be a public threat to not detain the parents. Our border services need to verify their history is correct and their claims are true. It's a tough issue when kids are involved, perhaps daily visits could over the problem.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Asylum seekers? No. Illeagal immigrants. If they can live and work in America, they can apply for Canadain residency just like everyone else. Walking across a border in the winter makes them as much an asylum seeker than some drunk tubers who happen to float to the Canadian side of Niagara during the summer. Furthermore if they take their kids in the middle of the night in -20 with no proper winter clothing to claim "refuge", they're a piece of shit. Not only does that endanger their own life but the kids have no say to what stupid endeavour their parents have taken them on.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;there's a ton of public unions out there too. Are you talking about government employees like BCTF?  gt;But why shouldn't unions be able to influence the way we're governed? This coming from a union member myself, the unions are self serving entities with their own agenda that doesn't represent the entire province. When the people vote, they vote for a representative to speak on their behalf in legislature/parliment. But what happens when large organizations get involved in polotics is that the constituents voices get drowned out in favour of large organizations that don't represent the people. It's not a matter of opinion over which economic system one favours, it's about a balanced and fair democratic process. That's why unions and corporations should have no place in polotics. Don't know why I'm being voted as my arguments are respectful and on topic but if anyone disagrees please do so in form of comment.</TEXT>

Residential schools severely impacted the lives of a generation and even more to come. Having someone say sorry ingenuinly is actually aiding to the problem of first nations as it takes the heat off our prime minister for not doing enough at home. Some reserves don't even have running water for crying out loud. The Catholic church is not innocent at all but all I see is finger pointing by our pm when there are current solvable issues in first nation communities and all he can muster up is an easy photo opportunity.</TEXT>

People are people and it doesn't matter what race or religion a person hails from in my opinion. What my comment was really about was to show the hype around minorities and tolerance for religion. But when someone who is white and holds a common religious status, it's open game for the media and everyone is free to criticize.

They all followed the doctrine of Marx and used it to their advantage to overthrow governments, press and murder the citizens of every country. YOU can declare that that isn't communism but revolution through violent means is in its doctrine. Who ever has implemented communism on it's people have all ended up with the same results.

    <TEXT>I started non union and went union after a two or so years. It all starts with propaganda plain and simple from both sides. I find non union guys have a conception that all unionized workers do is show up and get paid, are not knowledgeable, and often complain about non issues. This typically starts from foreman or senior people who use anecdotal evidence and say things like "working like a union worker"..etc... But from the union side of things you get the opposite type. Typically old boys who say "scab this, scab that" "This is bullshit"... never have worked non union and consider any worker not in the union are people who do things against code and are low life's. So with this being said you get these two types meeting on a jobsite (one's fire alarm , other has main contract sort of scenario) you can see how they may clash. Personally I prefer the union it's just too bad that we have people who buy into the us vs them mentality because we all could stand to make better wages and do better work unified and organised.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not at all. The communist doctrine states revolution by any means necessary which includes a violent uprising. It would have to transition to a socialist government owned state until there is no more "proletariat" and eventually become a stateless society. There is no way that western values would still be intact under Communist rule. That would mean every citizen who choses democracy/liberty wpuld either be executed or jailed indefinatly like in past communist societies.</TEXT>

The safety standards are so strict that the rules are geared towards placing blame on the workers 100% of the time. So if someone were to smoke marijuana while on their days off, come into work, and 13 days later was caught dropping a screw driver from a ten foot ladder they would have to go for a drug test to keep their job. This happens all time and that's why I don't believe there is a problem with substance abuse at suncore.

There was a post last year about a mod who had his/her comments deleted by another mod which ultimately proved that it's up to the mods discretion and not a definitive answer.

    <TEXT>So a government funded organization decides to hide and denounce a documentary of a unique point of view for political reasons. They've decided the public should not view the documentary but still take funds from the taxpayer. It parallels a book burning in every way. The government does not want people thinking critically about an issue that is against their political narrative. Say it was a paper text. We all pay for a unbiased media source that has gone above and beyond to hide the distribution of a documentary that contradicts a government bill (C-16)</TEXT>

It is a female dominated career with great pay and benefits but you never see articles of toxic femininity in the workplace or a sister code that makes men feel unwelcome. This is becuase people accept that most men don't want to go into nursing and would enjoy different careers. But this neo feminist movement has gone so far as to make any gender inequality for females an act of modern oppression.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As much as I dislike the Trudeau government, I think this poll is wrong. Ontario and Quebec still have a large Liberal fan base. I think Sheer has an uphill battle for popularity where as it would have been smooth sailng with Bernier becuase of the French vote.

    <TEXT>I agree he is polarizing and he carries controversial libertarian values, but like I said before it is a popularity contest for most folks. Sheer's accent is very thick and I think it resembles Stephan Dion trying to lead the liberals. Most English speaking voters couldn't relate. In my opinion I believe a fluent speaking, smooth talking person has a better shot than the awkward, not so fluent person with more aligned ideals. I wish it were differnt, but that's why I believe we are sitting with Trudeau as a pm at this time.</TEXT>

Or how Hillary Clinton was supposed to win by a landslide in the 2016 election. I don't think the Trudeau Liberals are doing a good job but they rally a lot of support in Ontario and Quebec which holds 2/3 of the population that votes.</TEXT>

Canada has a dark history of colonization and it's only the post modernist view that places these kinds of lenses on non issues to cause anger and divisiveness.

    <TEXT>I think we need better mental health services for people with mental health issues. We can walk into a hospital with an infectious disease and be treated fine by society but mental health is often overlooked and shamed upon. That being said I side with police in most of these cases as they have to go home to their families too. I think if we spent more money into health services before foreign aid and wasteful things like temporary rinks, we'd actually see a decline in this statistic.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Still, people could abort the baby themselves the old fashioned way. Well they could do that now and it is illegal becuase you need to be a licenced physician in Canada to preform a abortion. While I do agree with a simple amendment outlawing 2nd/3rd term abortions, I'm not sure if this is a massive problem. I have to say I trust the doctor and what they decide is best for the patient.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Pick your poison of left wing sites degrading Ford. Do a quick Google search if you don't believe me. I'm saying the left is attacking free speech unless it agrees with its narrative.

I agree with both parties campaigning and free thought but it is evident that emotions will control a debate rather than logic.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;A Facebook post from the page of the Alberta Three Percenter shows members training with weapons. They are literally skeet shooting. This whole article is full speculation and 'what ifs'. I'd be way more concerned about antifa than these guys.</TEXT>
