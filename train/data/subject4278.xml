    <TEXT>I only played it on hurt me plenty so that might be why, but i felt the level was a little easy. Rather than careful placement that forces you to glue your eyes on the ammo counter, the large ammo caches made it a cake walk through hell. The level design was not bad but felt rather linear and lacked dooms labyrinthine design. Overall for a first level i thought it was pretty good. Sorry if i sounded harsh i just wanted to make sure you got some feedback and criticism for future improvement.</TEXT>

I've heard that generally amd parts will be more gentle with my wallet and I was wondering if anyone had good recommendations for someone lacking in money. for a cpu i will go all out and buy something mid-high tier because i don't plan on replacing it any time soon. However the part i am having the most trouble with is GPUs. I am willing to spend about 250 on the GPU and im looking for something atleast as fast as a gtx 960. -Edit: Total build value im looking at is around 800 (no peripherals or OS included)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Male guppy swimming in one spot near surface</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-08-23 05:06:31</DATE>
    <TEXT>I Have a male guppy that only swims in one spots and am worried about disease parasites etc... the issue is unique to this one fish. 3 females that share the tank with him swim around actively and eat as normal. The male that does this also has no problem swimming if you approach the glass or when food is added, but quickly returns to the same spot. As far as I can tell I can't spot ick or a form of rot. I have an air stone and filter so water should be airrated. My tank is not 100% cycled but daily I am changing 25% with dechlorinated water. It is a 10 gallon tank If you need any more info feel free to ask for it Pics of filter and air as well as the guppy in question: http://m.imgur.com/a/k4oQO</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yesterday I made a post about a guppy only swimming in one spot. I believe his swim bladder failed or something along those lines. He was no longer able to swim naturally and was being blown by the flow of the filter. What are causes of swim bladder and buoyancy issues. I want to know because there are still 3 fish in the tank and want to try and prevent the same problem from happening to them. At this point I don't believe there is anything I can do to keep it alive and I'm keeping it in a quarantine tank untill it dies naturally or I find a humane way to euthanize it.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2016-10-14 17:19:31</DATE>
    <TEXT>My tank is in a very real threat of being overstocked. I have a 10 gallon tank that previously had 4 guppies (1 male, 3 female). I was too quick to add fish and the male and a female died. I was left with the two females i have today. Before Dying in childbirth the guppy had a whopping fry count of 36. I was hoping that some of them would had been eaten ,died to natural causes, or whatever the case. I was wrong, very wrong 3 months later i have way too many young guppies. I can almost guarantee there is no way a 10 gallon can sustain 25+ adult fish. Should i take the next month or so to invest in a larger tank and begin cycling it? I figure a 55 gallon tank should do well to house them all.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The various radio's have no respect for genre. I am a fan of various genres and from what i can tell google is tone deaf. Wanna Listen to Daft punk, Good you can have one song followed by iron maiden and slayer. feeling in the mood for something in particular? Fuck you were just gonna play whatever the hell is in your library and likes and just mash all that shit up and give you a new song every here and there. The longer i use this service i swear google understands me less and less.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>While I was gone my roommate bumped my outlet and unplugged the aquariums heater. I recently broke my thermostat so I can't say for sure but the water is easily in the 40-60 degree (Fahrenheit) range no where near as high as should be. Obviously my heater is back on but what should I do to undo any damage. They are angels usually kept in 78-80 degree water.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I bought my angels as juveniles about 4 months ago. There were 4 in the tank. And ever since the beginning I had one that was ever so slightly bigger who was a bully from the get go. The most he ever did was a bit of chasing. But I think he drove the other fish to the edge. Today I found the dried out husk of my favorite fish on the ground after realising there were only 3 fish in the tank. What should I do? The bully never messes with the other 2 fish which leads me to believe they were 2 males who didn't get along. There has been no pairing of any kind yet.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2017-03-13 22:31:55</DATE>
    <TEXT>I have had so many different types of fish and neon tetras are the hardest fish I've ever had to keep alive. And this is coming from someone who has bred discus. Maybe it is just my local stores but there is no way a tiny fish is the hardest fish I've ever kept. Yesterday I purchased 10 neon tetras for a 20 g that is well established 0 ammonia 0 nitrite  gt;1ppm nitrate. 4 fish have died in one day 2 died within hours of my slow drip acclimation over about an hour and a half. Today after work 2 more were found Dead. And I'm wondering what I'm doing wrong or of this is truly the weakest of all fish. I have spent more money on dead neon than discus in my time as an aquarist. Why the hell am I not just keeping more discus if they actually stay alive.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Do you ever do water changes? Bad things tend to build up in an unfiltered bowl. If you want to benefit the life of your pet consider a 5gallon aquarium with a filter and heater. A larger tank Allows for more room to free swim and explore, reduces your need to do frequent water changes. while the filter removes harmful waste from the water. The heater will allow you little friend to have a more regulated digestive system and a more natural metabolism. Cold water drastically reduced lifespan because of many bodily complications. If you want to see your fish happy again it may be worth the upgrade.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If you knew anything about the lore you would know that the bath is a very important piece to the whole band and their very founding. If you go back to the self-titled album and listen to Seattle yodle you can even pick up bits and pieces of the power of the bath. What you see in Saturn barz is just a mere glimpse into the powers held by the bath. The bath is both everything and nothing. Capable of doing anything while usually doing nothing. To truly understand the bath one must be one with the bath. Take a bath and then ask yourself the question. By this time you should be the bath and all of life's greatest secrets will be revealed.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Item crates in video games, are they Haram?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-09-17 10:54:04</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I've been thinking about this for the past few days, are crates in things like CS:GO, Team fortress 2... Etc Gambling? Basically in these games you receive a locked box. The only way to open said box is to pay $2.50~ for a key. You always are guaranteed something, though the qualities of items vary quite a bit. With the introduction of things like the steam community market, players have assigned monetary value to all the items in the game. Because cases can have items ranging in value from pennies to several hundred dollars if you are lucky, a common practice when opening cases is to open many at a time and hope that you get something of a high value. Could this be seen as a form of Gambling? I try to avoid things like this as they tend to be an unwise decision when handling money, but I would also like to know if they are Haram.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>How is Arabic such a beautiful language?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-09-19 23:46:36</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'd like to preface this by saying I can't speak more a few words to save my life. Arabic sounds great on the ears. A simple sentence sounds like poetry. Before I came to Islam I loved to listen to nasheeds simply because the vocals sound so good. The words feel powerful. When someone sings in English I never get this feeling, the words feel lifeless. Even in a nasheed English parts feel less meaningful to me even though I can understand them perfectly. The way Arabic flows together and interconnects is like art.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2017-09-21 22:48:00</DATE>
    <TEXT>Where do the other species of humans that existed fit into the story of creation? As someone of European descent a small part of my DNA shared with that of neanderthals and other proto-humans. in the Quran it is stated that God (SWT) did not make humans as the first living creatures. We're there other "humans" on Earth before Adam? Another idea that came to mind is that it isn't explicitly stated Adam was a homo sapien, is it possible that Adam was one of the earlier species of human such as a neanderthal or other form of hominid? I'm not necessarily speaking of very far back forms of humans just the ones that are easily proven to have existed.</TEXT>

Tell them about the great scientific miracles in the Quran, then make sure to remind them that the Quran was "written" 1400-1500 years ago and is to this day unaltered from the origin texts. Tell them how you know the Quran is the word of God and not a collection of fairy tales. If my cold Muslim hating heart was brought to Islam anyone's can. Inshallah brother/sister.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've struggled with this addiction and I've lurked here for a little bit. I figured if I posted here it might help me because then I have the pressure of not letting others down. My main Issue is that I actually don't have a porn addiction. I guess years of doing it has made it where I don't need to see anything. It's just something I do when I don't have anything to do. Basically if I am not occupied that is what my mind's first instinct is.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I won't go into detail here as you can easily find someone more knowledgeable on the subject, but there the false apostles such as Paul who perverted the words of Jesus peace be upon him and made Christianity into what he wanted it to be. There are those who see a religion that put restrictions and regulations on ones lives and rather than change for the better they would change the rules, and change the texts.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Help me with debunking ahmadiyya, so I can get out of a sticky situation.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-09-29 03:53:43</DATE>
    <TEXT>Can any of you guys help me compile a list of ahmadi beliefs that go against the Quran and show the corruption in their cult? So a few months ago I spoke to some of my "Muslim" friends and Co-workers. I asked them for a copy of the Quran so that I may learn about Islam. I've done a lot of solo research and I've been Muslim for 2 months now. As soon as I told them I wished to become Muslim they were very happy and they invited me to their masjid. The only problem is up until recently they hadn't even revealed to me they were ahmadi. At first I thought not much of it I thought it was just another sect of Islam and I could continue to just subscribe to Sunni ideology. At this point I am technically part of their jamaat, but Im not buying any of the bullshit about Mirza ghulam Ahmad. With these people all I have ever heard about from them is money. They want 10% of my income not for the poor or zakat just for the "running of official business". On top of this they keep telling me to buy into their bullshit unproven homeopathic medicines. To donate to their proprietary charity humanity first. And now that the money is aside I can talk about their core beliefs that contradict Islam. Let's not beat around the bush there are numerous quranic verses and Hadith that state that Mohammed peace be upon him is the LAST AND FINAL prophet. They always come up with lame excuses and it seems that can't agree what Mirza ghulam Ahmad really is. I've heard so many things from no he's not a prophet, he was a lesser prophet, he wasn't a law giving prophet... The list goes on and on. Next they have absolutely no respect for isa/Jesus peace be upon him. They say that he escaped crucification, traveled to India taught there, and then later died. They say that Jesus peace be upon him is truly dead and that Ahmad is the resurrection of Christ and an embodiment of his traits and Mohammed peace be upon him. They don't believe in any miracles at all. They claim any mention of a miracle is purely metaphorical. Don't you believe taking away the mysticism of Allah subhana wa ta'ala kinda of takes away from his power and importance? Thank you for listening to my rantings. I plan on leaving them as soon as humanly possible, And I plan on never paying them a penny. It's absolutely deplorable these people would bait and switch on a new convert and try to extort them out of their money. Can you guys please help me with some quranic verses and Hadith to help me talk my way out of this to my friends and Co-workers. I think that they are still good people. They were born into it and have just been drinking the kool-aid all their lives. If it is possible I would like to still remain on good terms with them and try to lead them to true Islam with me. TLDR: got baited into ahmadiyya don't believe their nonsense. They want money from me and I want to remain on good terms with my co-workers/friends. Edit: and before any athiests or exmuslims come here and have me leave Islam as a whole, don't bother. I believe in true Islam with all of my heart, and I simply want to separate the lies of a cult with that of Islam.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was an agnostic athiest, raised Christian. I always believed in god, even when I was athiest I felt that there was something there. When I was in time of need I still prayed to some mysterious power. One day I asked my Muslim co-worker for a copy of the Quran. I was absolutely in awe with it. Every word of it felt like it was filled with power and meaning. I started to do a lot of solo research, and I found out that nearly everything in Islam is what I had already believed in. However if you check my post history things got a little sour. I didn't know the people I worked with were ahmadi and I'm currently trying to work my way out of a situation. Edit: link to my post for full story https://www.reddit.com/r/islam/comments/734sej/help_me_with_debunking_ahmadiyya_so_i_can_get_out/</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I mean really rejecting a sin kind of is a big deal. Not to say it makes you a kafir, but its not up to us to decide what is sin and what isn't. By definition I'm probably not a very good Muslim if I rejecting the fact the Zina and drinking alcohol and partying are sins.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I decided to finally tell my friends about my conversion, because what's the worst that could happen right? Now they want nothing to do with me because I "worship a pedophile warlord rapist, and sit down a rug and pray to a false god". They are going around slandering my name and making it seem like I am responsible for every terror attack known to man. I've never been so lonely in my life and I don't know what to do. I tried to clear up these accusations but they don't negotiate with terrorists.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm sure someone else will write a much better response, but hear me out. Perhaps the reason he is not answering your prayers or only occasionally helping you is because of your mindset. When you pray to Allah (SWT) you need to be genuine and pray with all your heart. I put my whole heart and mind into praising god, and I find that I often get what I want or ask for. Also make sure when you pray to him pray out of genuine need, not out of coveting or greed.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Perhaps the issue is that he does help you in your daily life. Count all the good things that have happened to you. Is he really just a heartless observer because of the few times he did not give you what you wanted? Perhaps Allah forbids a Thing you think to be good, or provides you a thing you think to be bad. Surely Allah knows best.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Actually in the US (the US dropped the gold standard a long time ago) and most of europe's money has nothing backing it, and you literally could just print more money but that would cause inflation. While Bitcoin has nothing backing it, it is a finite resource in that a set amount of Bitcoin can be mined. However to prevent rapid inflation the more Bitcoins that have been mined, the harder future algorithms are to crack.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've heard 10% from the actual jamaat that I've been to. I am a convert to Islam and the people that helped me and invited me to Islam are ahmadis. However I find it very hard to believe that Mirza ghulam Ahmed is the Messiah or anything else. Ahmadiyya has a pretty good record of fraud from keeping money in Panama bank accounts, to Chanda fraud. It sounds to me like ahmadiyya has more in line with a cult than an actual sect of islam. 90% of the ahmadis I meet tell me that they were born into it and they do it to make their family happy. I've asked a few of them what makes ahmadis different from other Muslims and they can't even tell me what they believe in. Technically I am an ahmadi but I don't know how long that will last for.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sorry to break the jerk here but I know this guy irl. He's fuckin insane on 2007scape but he's also got like twenty level 100+ on WoW and had a bunch of Tier 3 level 60s on Nostalrius. He's a fuckin sick gamer, he can stay up for no exaggeration 72 hours straight playing. He is also fortunate enough that his uncle is Frank Fritz from the show American Pickers. So he's always playing around with some old toy or retro gaming console or vintage cars. Lucky dude.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So heres the thing about porn, It's staged, It's fake, and It's consensual. It's definitely weird but maybe its just a fetish you have for being dominant/dominated. Ask yourself and answer truthfully; do you actually have any need or want to rape anyone? Is that something you could ever do and live with? If the answer is no to both of these you probably just have a simple fetish, and there is a place for that in the bedroom between two consenting adults. If the answer is yes consider seeking mental help, it is never right or Ok to carry out your fantasies on someone who is not consenting to such a thing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey, Convert here. You don't need to openly announce it to every one at first, take it slow and make sure you really believe. i used to be a very islamaphobic athiest, and i would hang out in alt-right groups on the internet (I still have a kekistan flag in my room im too lazy to take down). Anyone can be a muslim, and yeah you might face some opposition, you might even lose some friends or family, but at the end of the day you gain so many brothers and sisters. I can personally say that even though ive had my fair share of grief, ive gained far more happiness and the connection with my brothers and sisters is far closer than that of any of my "friends".</TEXT>

It's really not hard to make sure, your race doesn't die off, just breed and have children. The current mindset in the west is that getting married and having children is waste of time and money. No one is going out of their way to commit white genocide or any of this other stupid stuff they spout. This is all coming from a white convert who used to spend most of his time on 4chan and /pol/.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So I converted to Islam a fair few months ago and ever since then i have experienced the glory of of a truly clean water washed anus. But Alas today was a day of true terror. As I did my usual business at work I was interrupted but a grumbly tummy. 4 cups of coffee and lactose intolerance had gotten to the best of me. I did the only thing I could I bolted to the bathroom faster than you can say Allahu ackbar. I rushed to the nearest stall and did my business. I will spare you the details but to my dismay I looked down and I noticed there was indeed no bidet, no water hose, not even a simple watering can, or a cup. I was greeted by my old arch-enemy; toilet paper. I spent many a moon wiping but alas even if my anus was clean I was plagued with the thoughts and feeling of phantom shit. Ahead of me was another excruciating 6 hour of work. This is the last time I use an accursed kaffiric toilet.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ironically I first converted to Islam because I was friends with some "Muslims" at work. I actually got a copy of the quran from them and began my research there. I didn't even know what an ahmadi was at the time. No less than a week after my conversion I realized that they believed in a bunch of non-sense. It goes to show the only way someone can believe this stuff is to be born into it and have it pushed onto you by your parents. So I guess maybe if ahmadis didn't exist I wouldn't be Muslim right now.</TEXT>

Truthfully I don't know much about Sufism but I guarantee no one there feels drugs are not Haram, and there is more to Sufism than just dancing. Some people have this idea that they don't even pray, that somehow they have replaced prayers entirely with singing and dancing.</TEXT>
