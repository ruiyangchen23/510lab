    <TITLE>Need help with 8 year old council tax demand</TITLE>
    <DATE>2015-07-23 21:39:54</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've just opened a letter from a debt collection agency for a final reminder for a council tax bill for around  #163;90 from a house I lived in at about 2007. There is also an enforcement notice of just over  #163;300. The letter doesn't give any dates that debt is from but I moved out of this house in around 2007 to live in another house share. The guy I lived in that house with continued to live there. In 2009 I moved to a different city altogether. In 2014 I again moved to a different city (1 place for six months) and then where I live now for over a year. The letter basically says if I don't pay they will send bailiffs and it looks pretty immenent. However this is the first time I have seen any request for payment. I can afford to pay it but I don't think I owe it. What can I do? Thanks in advance for any advice</TEXT>

    <DATE>2015-08-22 20:00:38</DATE>
    <TEXT>Today I got my S4 out and part of the Traktor S4 USB connection was still inside the USB lead. It is completely broken and not repairable by me. Is it possible to connect to my MacBook with the midi to USB connection? If I have the correct cable? If this does work would there be any difference to the USB to USB set up? Also, I'm in the UK. What would be the best option for repair? Is this a straight forward swap out for a local electronics shop? Is the USB port on the back of an S4 a standard part? Or will I need to send to NI? Finally can anyone estimate how much this might cost to fix? Many thanks in advance</TEXT>

Course 3: Goose breast with potato dauphanois and red wine jus Course 4: Banoffee pie Course 5: is a cheese board (I was thinking of a nice port for this) Many thanks in advance for your recommendations and Merry Xmas to you all.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes, but your post seems to imply that it is ridiculous the American commentators thought that it would result in a ban. 8 years isn't that long in a game that's been played for close to 120 years. In that context its only a recent development that it wouldn't result in a ban. IIRC Only Ivanovic has been sent off since the rule change so Pedro's red is only the second time this situation has arisen since the rule change.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm not in agreement with the views of the manifesto. My belief is that there are not enough women in tech and tech leadership positions because computer science and coding isn't taught early enough in schools - this causes an unequal amount of males to females to pursue these subjects at University meaning tech companies start and then grow with an unbalanced number of men on staff. However, feminists have argued that there should be more women in politics and more women in boardrooms - the reason they give is that it would lead to more rationale/softer thinking (remember when people were saying the financial crisis would not have happened if more women had been in the boardrooms of these financial institutions). So you can't have it both ways - either women have different attributes to men (which is what the author of the manifesto said) or they don't in which case the arguments used previously by people promoting the benefits of more women politicians and leaders doesn't stand. Either way, the manifesto raised some interesting points. Particularly around the liberal whitewashing of those with alternative views. If you hire the smartest people in the world and ask them to express themselves and their opinions don't be surprised to meet some challenging ideas and viewpoints. As a qualifier to my comment I work in tech, I am socially liberal, I am disappointed Google fired this person.</TEXT>

The solicitor needs to make sure that the money is coming from a proper source and is not laundered or from the proceeds of crime etc. If the father in law has paid the deposit or part of then also the solicitor would need to check that this is a gift and not a loan as this could impact the affordability of the mortgage.

    <TEXT>So the deposit and fees are being paid by the home buyers and your father in law has nothing to do with the process. As others have pointed out I would make a compliant to the practice first as they will have an internal complaints process to follow and then to the Law Society if it's not resolved. However I am finding it difficult to believe a solicitor would not know who they can and cannot speak to, it's literally their job.</TEXT>

It was also revealed that the US Doctor had a financial interest in the experimental treatment he had offered to perform. NHS treatments aren't routinely denied because of price.

    <TEXT>Two examples I can think off the top of my head... In 2013 there was a standoff between Rupert Murdoch and the 6 independent Directors of The Times as they refused to endorse News Corps Editor picks for The Times and Sunday Times because they were "Murdoch's men". Murdoch had pushed out previous Editor James Harding in order to replace home with one of his own. The Times front page was the only British paper not to run with The Hillsborough verdict (funny coincidence since it was damning of The Sun). It was changed later in the day due to a mutiny led by The Times Sports desk. Murdoch was in the papers offices on the day of the verdict. More research into Murdochs influence over the Wall Street Journal which has similarly gone down hill since Murdoch's takeover. A PEJ analysis of front page content has seen the WSJ take a marked shift away from covering business towards Government, Foreign Affairs,  amp; Lifestyle in the first four years of Murdoch's ownership. [Details of the study here](http://www.journalism.org/2011/07/20/wall-street-journal-under-rupert-murdoch/) Even the Wall Street Journal when Murdoch's purchase offer of their parent company examined the half-century career of Murdoch and concluded that  gt; gt; #8220;his newspapers and other media outlets have made coverage decisions that advanced the interests of his sprawling media conglomerate, News Corp. In the process, Mr. Murdoch has blurred a line that exists at many other U.S. media companies between business and news sides #8212;a line intended to keep the business and political interests of owners from influencing the presentation of news. #8221;</TEXT>

If you want to do a 6 day program then look at something that isolates the muscle groups like PPL rather than full compound exercises like 5x5 or SL.

    <TEXT>Did you sign a specific agreement to pay these fees back? IANAL but my view is that a line in handbook or your master contract would not be enough to enforce. Also for  #163;2000 it is unlikely they will pursue you in court as it would cost them more to get legal counsel to review and represent, the ball is in your court. I would advise see what documentation they have to enforce payback, secondly is there any reduction in the amount owed over time i.e. The amount you owe is 50% after one year and reduced further to zero after 2 or 3 years etc. I would suspect if there isn't this clause then again it may be unenforceable as a contract.</TEXT>

It doesn't matter how many times a single team is shown live in any market, each team gets 5% of the deal per season (20 teams). In the domestic market it works slightly differently as each place finish in the league is worth slightly more than the place below. You also earn based on TV appearances on English TV. Some of the bigger clubs want to change how the international money is distributed to account for the fact that they are the knee people are watching - however there are only 6 teams for and the rest are against so it has no chance of passing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Even though you can't escalate to the ombudsman for a final decision you can still contact them and let them know what is happening. A quick contact from them may help with the billing of the account and your broadband services whilst under dispute. As to your claim, it is standard contract law that if the price is altered outside of the original signed terms in most circumstances you can cancel as the other party is now failing to meet their obligations. Phone and Internet companies have recently tried to navigate this by adding an annual inflation price increase clause into their contracts, as inflation is quite high at the moment this can lead to some significant jumps in monthly prices. You would need to check your contract to see if this is something you have signed agreement to.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As an 'MBA' that works in a Senior Leadership role for a Global Tech company, the other side of the argument is that 'Technical' people (in as generic way as you placed all MBA's in the same pot) often lack the social skills to be effective leaders, lack the understanding on how a company has to operate on a financial footing to please all the stakeholders in the business, and often fail to see the bigger picture on how they fit into the companies wider objectives.</TEXT>

You should be able to go and buy 10,000 boxes from an EU country that has lower tax and save the difference, but you can only bring 2 Cartons officially. If you get caught with a large amount they are all confiscated and you can end up in a lot of trouble.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I travelled round Italy by train a few years ago. Because I'm used to paying UK rail fares I was actually amazed at how cheap it was to buy first class tickets. I've also been to the US hundreds of times. I was in Atlanta a few weeks ago and the MARTHA only covers a tiny area of the city and doesn't even go out to the new baseball stadium. Similarly you get coverage issues in San Fran and LA. New York has a pretty decent Underground system but compared to most large European cities it's grotty, dingy, and dated. In Europe you can get to any town by train. I can be in Paris from my home in the UK in a few hours. I can get to Italy, Spain, Germany, etc fairly easy from there. [Compare this major rail map of the Europe](https://goo.gl/images/YauaGf) to the [US equivalent](https://goo.gl/images/Ck6Pqb) where you can see there are large gaps in coverage across the country.</TEXT>

It's just unfortunate that the EU still holds the cards here and seem to be an order of magnitude more competent at negotiation.

Chelsea do not have a functioning development path to the first team and its rightly called out by someone at the club. Who was the last homegrown player to come through at Chelsea?

You gotta shave the heads of your victims, and pull the teeth out for the sake of the piggies' digestion. You could do this afterwards, of course, but you don't want to go sievin' through pig shit, now do you? They will go through bone like butter. You need at least sixteen pigs to finish the job in one sitting, so be wary of any man who keeps a pig farm. They will go through a body that weighs 200 pounds in about eight minutes. That means that a single pig can consume two pounds of uncooked flesh every minute. Hence the expression, "as greedy as a pig."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>He's playing in a zonal system. It's his role to block long range shots from outside the box and act as an outlet for Arsenal defenders to pass to if they win possession back in their own area. Arsenal's style is to play out from the back quickly with passes to feet, and not hit long balls forward or into the channels. He has to stay where he is because Arsenals counter attack is based on the rest of the team knowing where he is at all times. If he chased the ball into the box against his pre determined role he would likely play people onside as the defence is working as a unit that he is not meant to be part of, leave a quick pass out of the box to him exposed as he is not in position and gift Watford another easy attacking opportunity.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[Discussion]London UK, cyclists are looking for excuses to kick off. It's not a good look.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-10-18 22:57:44</DATE>
    <TEXT>I work a lot in London and the last two stays I've seen incidents with cyclists that have been wholly unnecessary and resulted in aggressive cyclists kicking off in a way I have not seen in any other part of the country. I cycle in my home city but not in London. Story 1, my uber turned in the road and pulled out to turn into my hotel driveway. A cyclist in the lane was approaching as he pulled out, made not effort to slow down or alter course, wearing no reflective geat or helmet, and with a standard light on the front of the bike. I noticed him from the back of the uber but he was most likely in a blind spot of the driver. He followed us into the driveway of the hotel and banged on the driver window and started shouting and swearing. I got out and said it was his responsibility aswell to avoid incidents and he almost wanted something to happen so he could kick off. Not surprisingly he told me to F Off so I told him to ride on and next time maybe try and be more visible. Story 2, today crossing some lights in central London a car has overshot the lights is parked in the crossing. A cyclist crossing rather than cycling round is screaming at the driver to move. I said to him he can't move because it's a red light onto a roundabout, cycle round and chill out. He eventually cycles round and we are waiting at the next set of crossings together. He's on his bike and I'm on foot. He starts swearing at me and I'm like "why are you being a dick, there was no need to cause that argument in the middle of the road and you were kicking off for the sake of it". Again he told me in no uncertain terms what I could do with my opinion. I said London cyclists have a death wish (seriously try driving round central London and see some of the crazy shit they pull), and then act like nobheads because they love kicking off at drivers. Rant over, would love to get others opinions - particularly drivers and cyclists who have done so in London.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The cab had turned and then pulled out from the curb. Two lanes of traffic moving in that direction. My post was more discussing the cyclists reaction though. Incredibly confrontational bordering on violent. It's okay to point out where someone was in the wrong but it seemed to me that incident was avoidable as ten cyclist could see the manoeuvre, the driver indicated, but chose to keep riding and then chose the confrontation.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Tactically with no offside the game should be more expansive. Defenders will no longer be able to keep a high line and so teams will be less compact. This will open up space to either pass their way through teams more quickly and easily, or alternatively teams can play more direct with long balls over the top to the big man up front with runners behind. In my view with no offsides the winners will be the athletes (footballers with engines rather than footballers with great technique) as with more space poor technique will be more forgiven. Also expect to see more goals - particularly early on as its chaos until coaches find a tactical way to best balance attack and defence.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It always surprises me at how little Americans understand socialism and even capitalism. They #8217;ve been brainwashed to hate the word socialism or socialist yet have no idea of why. Some examples, the distribution of wealth and new players in American sports is a socialist system. It is designed to benefit everyone rather than create competition and survival of the fittest. There is no relegation, wealth is shared across teams, and the weakest teams get access to the best new players first. Healthcare, despite their healthcare costing more per capita than almost anywhere else in the world and delivering not comparable outcomes for the cost, many would rather pay more individually per month to have coverage that will still likely bankrupt you if anything bad happens (around 80% of all medical bankruptcys are people who had coverage), rather than paying less and having everyone covered for everything because it means some people will get care even if they haven #8217;t paid into the system.</TEXT>

If you have received an FPN for littering or dog fouling you can challenge the FPN within 14 days of the issue of the notice. If you do not agree that you committed the offence then the matter will be dealt with through formal prosecution via the courts. It will then be up to the court, on receiving evidence, to determine whether or not an offence was committed and therefore whether or not any penalty should be imposed.</TEXT>

With such low margins you can end up in a situation where a) you are needing to win multiple new contracts with the initial down payments used to keep cash flow going on existing projects and b) complications on existing projects can end up killing the company (it was only 3-4 of the Carillion contract that went tits up and drove the company to liquidation).</TEXT>

If you think that #8217;s lower than thought then it #8217;s worth pointing out that Arsenal joined the competition in the 3rd round with only 32 teams left.

    <TEXT>Of course Arsenal need to win every game. That #8217;s what we are calculating. What are the odds of Arsenal facing a Man City keeper in every round. As Arsenal only enter the competition in the 3rd round we can calculate this with the starting number of City keepers from this round - we can calculate this because we already know how many there were. Your scenario would never work because you would never know in the future an accurate number of Man City keepers out on loan playing in another first team because that #8217;s in the future and it hasn #8217;t happened yet. It could be zero, it could be 10. That would lead to no accurate result.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; Personally I always thought that this number (not always in fact, but after 4 years of training I had time to search and think about that) is way too high and that it's useless to eat so much protein  gt; It means that even if you don't watch the number of protein you eat, you probably eat enough, or are close to the optimal number.  gt; For me it's just marketing for the whey industry, they made fake studies to give a high need of protein to create the problem you have : "difficulty to reach this amount of protein",  gt; I think you shouldn't focus so much on protein. Focus on training instead, and focus on eating more calories than you spend if you want to put on muscle All of that bullshit was in your original comment. Your response to my comment just cites random studies (protein intake for nitrogen balance is not the same as protein for muscle mass, protein intake to maintain muscle mass is not the same as protein intake required to gain muscle mass). Did you just google protein and muscle and write down all of the synopsis #8217; without being able to understand any of its context?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Most likely Sales than any of this positions. Product Management would require a Computer Science or Electrical Engineering degree, typically after these degrees people tend to stay in that subject area for Masters or PhD. Marketing is a limited field in tech in that there are very few Senior leadership positions or progression to the board. Finance, here you find some MBA #8217;s but with a Finance related degree and often later in the career when looking to be an FD or CFO. There are a fairly high percentage of CEO #8217;s with an accountancy and Finance background. Sales - here you have the most MBA #8217;s. This is because in tech organisation this is a) where the most money is and the rewards for a promotion are rapidly increasing, leading large numbers of sales people to hit targets is one of the roles that having an MBA assists with b) this is by far the largest part of a tech organisation and therefore the most people c) large portions of Sales leaders end up at the C-Level in tech organisations.

Then when you got your six pieces, you gotta get rid of them, because there's no good in leaving it in a deep freeze for your mum to discover now is it? Then I hear the best thing to do is feed them to pigs. You gotta starve the pigs for a few days then the sight of a chopped up body would look like curry to a pissant. You gotta shave the head of your victim and pull the teeth out for the sake of the piggy's digestion. You could do this afterwards of course but you don't wanna go sifting through pig shit now do ya? They will go through bone like butter. You need at least sixteen pigs to do the job in one sitting so be weary of any man who keeps a pig farm. They will go through a body that weighs two-hundred pounds in about...eight minutes. That means that a single pig can consume two pounds of un-cooked flesh every minute. Hence the expression: "as greedy as a pig."</TEXT>

During my time at company X I was responsible for directly managing and leading 50 people to achieve stretching sales targets... #8221; I much prefer to do and receive applications in this was as I can show a much more personalised approach to the application and I prefer to keep my CV standardised as in my opinion a standardised CV allowed me to more competently talk through my job history in interviews...others may take the different approach.</TEXT>

I think it was almost an afterthought (for Noel), but there was so many gags at the time because I was so thin  #8211; 'Is it because he's so thin that he casts no shadow, is that what it's about?' I did say to him, 'Am I a vampire what are you trying to say man?'"  gt; Also NME credit the song as written about Ashcroft  gt; Noel Gallagher wrote this 1995 Oasis song about the Verve frontman.  #8220;He always seemed to me to not be very happy about what was going on around him, almost trying too hard, #8221; Noel has said.  #8220;That #8217;s why it goes,  #8216;He was bound with the weight of all the words he tried to say. #8217; I always felt he was born at the wrong place, and in the wrong place, and he was always trying to say the right things, but they came out wrong. #8221;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The policeman approaches the drivers door. "Is there a problem, Officer?" The policeman says, "Sir, you were speeding. Can I see your license please?" The driver responds, "I'd give it to you but I don't have one." "You don't have one?" The man responds, "I lost it four times for drink driving." The policeman is shocked. "I see. Can I see your vehicle registration papers please?" "I'm sorry, I can't do that." The policeman says, "Why not?" "I stole this car." The officer says, "Stole it?" The man says, "Yes, and I killed the owner." At this point the officer is getting irate. "You what?" "She's in the trunk if you want to see." The Officer looks at the man and slowly backs away to his car and calls for back up. Within minutes, five police cars show up, surrounding the car. A senior officer slowly approaches the car, clasping his half-drawn gun. The senior officer says, "Sir, could you step out of your vehicle please!" The man steps out of his vehicle. "Is there a problem, sir?" "One of my officers told me that you have stolen this car and murdered the owner." "Murdered the owner?" The officer responds, "Yes, could you please open the trunk of your car please?" The man opens the trunk, revealing nothing but an empty trunk. The officer says, "Is this your car sir?" The man says, "Yes" and hands over the registration papers. The officer, understandably, is quite stunned. "One of my officers claims that you do not have a driving licence." The man digs in his pocket revealing a wallet and hands it to the officer. The officer opens the wallet and examines the licence. He looks quite puzzled. "Thank you, sir. One of my officers told me you didn't have a licence, stole this car, and murdered the owner." The man replies, "I bet you the lying bastard told you I was speeding too!"</TEXT>

    <TEXT>All we know about the tapes from the steel dossier is that Trump has allegedly slept with prostitutes and this has given Russia kompromat over him. There is nothing to suggest the prostitutes were under age. - That kompromat exists on Trump in the form of blackmailable[102][29] acts of paying bribes and engaging in "perverted sexual acts" in Russia.[79][3][80][92][103][104][88] (Dossier, pp. 1-2, 8, 11, 27). - That Trump "hated"[105] Obama so much that he hired the Presidential suite of the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Moscow and had prostitutes perform a "golden showers" show in front of him[81][54] in order to defile the bed used by President and Mrs. Obama on a previous visit. This is alleged to have happened in 2013. The alleged incident was reportedly secretly filmed and recorded by the FSB[103] for potential blackmail.[106][107][102][81][108][92] (Dossier, p. 2) - That "TRUMP #8217;s unorthodox behavior in Russia over the years had provided the authorities there with enough embarrassing material on the now Republican presidential candidate to be able to blackmail him if they so wished."[82][54][103][109] (Dossier, p. 2) - That "Russians apparently have promised not to use 'kompromat' they hold on TRUMP as leverage, given high levels of voluntary co-operation forthcoming from his team." "As far as 'kompromat' (compromising information) on TRUMP were concerned, although there was plenty of this, he understood the Kremlin had given its word that it would not be deployed against the Republican presidential candidate given how helpful and co-operative his team had been over several years, and particularly of late."[79][86][45] (Dossier, p. 11-12) - That Trump had explored the real estate sectors in St Petersburg and Moscow, "but in the end TRUMP had had to settle for the use of extensive sexual services there from local prostitutes rather than business success".[102][106] (Dossier, p. 8) That "TRUMP had visited St Petersburg on several occasions in the past and had been interested in doing business deals there involving real estate....[T]hat TRUMP had paid bribes there to further his interests but very discreetly and only through affiliated companies, making it very hard to prove.... [T]hat TRUMP had participated in sex parties in the city too, but that all direct witnesses to this recently had been 'silenced' i.e. bribed or coerced to disappear."[102][106] (Dossier, p. 27)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You #8217;ve miss understood the point I #8217;m trying to make. The Euro #8217;s is a tournament with 16 teams (soon to be 24) that are seeded in qualifying for the UEFA rankings. This means the teams that qualify are generally the best in UEFA. The World Cup however has 32 teams from a mix of the federations. The European countries and the top South American countries are much stronger than the North American and Asian countries that have qualification spots guaranteed. As an example it would be very rare for a team like Australia or Trinidad and Tobago or North Korea to qualify for the Euros yet there will be 6-10 teams at that level at each World Cup. That means that the groups in the World Cup can be easier and some teams can get an easier run to the final. In the Euros the groups are much tougher and even so you have to be out of the blocks quickly. But to your point, no non European team has ever won a WC in Europe so the history points towards it being a European team.</TEXT>

In 2012, Garber filed a lawsuit claiming Cohen had failed to pay a number of insurance settlements resulting from accidents involving their taxis. Arbitration documents from this case showed that Cohen had been making roughly $1 million per year from the taxi medallions they owned together. Today Cohen still reportedly owns a large number of taxi medallions with a Russian named Evgeny Friedman. It is believed that Evgeny owns more taxi medallions than any other individual in New York City, approximately 800 out of 13,605. It's not known what percentage of those Mr Cohen owns.

The alleged incident from 2013 was reportedly filmed and recorded by the FSB as kompromat. (Dossier, p. 2) And  gt; That Trump was susceptible to blackmail due to paying bribes and the existence of "embarrassing material" due to engagement in "perverted sexual acts" and "unorthodox behavior" in Russia There should be enough there to speculate about without having to make things worse and less credible.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;That an implication is allowed to be drawn from the 5th in civil trails is a flaw, not a benefit of our system What is your argument here? That I #8217;m right? The Fifth Amendment says that  #8220;No person. . . shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself. #8221; Note the word criminal in that passage Griffin v. California, 380 U.S. 609 (1965)  amp; Baxter v. Palmigiano, 425 U.S. 308, 318 (1976) both show that in a civil trial a jury may infer guilt by a defendant #8217;s refusal to answer questions of evidence against themselves.  #8220;Silence is often evidence of the most persuasive character. #8221; United States ex rel. Bilokumsky v. Tod, 263 U.S. 149 (1923)). Therefore pleasing the fifth in a civil case is rarely helpful and mostly incredibly damaging to a subjects case. TL:DR You can #8217;t just say decades of civil case law is wrong because you don #8217;t agree with it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>One of the top priorities of a sales manager is the ability to deliver an accurate forecast. In order to do this a sales manager needs to understand their teams pipeline. As a salesperson your forecast and delivery is getting rolled up through each layer of the organisation. When I #8217;m doing my sales meetings with my pipeline I #8217;m hoping that we can deliver an element of control over the number. Are we going to go over the target? If so why? Was it because of over performance, bluebirds, sandbagging, etc. Are we going to miss the number? If so why? Poor sales planning, a top deal moving out? Disruption in the marketplace? If I #8217;m finding this out each week in my sales meetings then I can plan and prepare and take mitigating action or even appropriately message the change in performance expectations. If I find out at at the end of each quarter because I #8217;ve just let everyone get on with it then I #8217;m probably going to get fired. My number is a key portion of what my company reports as it #8217;s expected earnings. Miss overall by a significant percentage and it hits the share price. Over performance is always better, but if you are a company that consistently misses its forecast over and under it hints towards a lack of control of what you and doing and impacts confidence.</TEXT>

If you haven #8217;t seen him before these are incredibly detailed, well researched, and are often joining the dots together before the major news publications. His credentials are listed in his bio. http://www.twitter.com/sethabramson/status/938568775695323141?lang=en In summary - 4 ambassadors from the countries involved in the purchase of Roseneft (Russia, Singapore, Italy,  amp; the Philippines) met at Trumps first ever foreign policy speech on 27th April 2016 held at the Mayflower. - Seth goes into the reasons why during this a meeting was arranged, namely to broker a deal for nuclear technology for Saudi Arabia with Russian help in delivery - Russia would need US sanctions dropped in order to do so.</TEXT>

Instead to keep things simple do a Start, Stop, Continue model. 3 things you need to start doing 3 things you need to stop doing 3 things you need to continue doing Also, If you #8217;re not familiar with the SMART method then I suggest reading up on it.

    <TEXT>A few things from my experience with dealing with CEO #8217;s, COO #8217;s, CTO #8217;s and SVPs. 1. Whenever I have had a big complaint over something incredibly petty i.e.  #8220;I never want to have to deal with that person again #8221;,  #8220;if you don #8217;t do xyz then I #8217;m pulling all my business #8221;...I remain calm and tell them I understand their frustration, i #8217;ll work to put it right, but can you please put it in writing in an email so I can get support internally for my actions. It #8217;s amazing how someone #8217;s perception of a situation changes when they have to write out an incredibly petty request which once sent they have no control over the audience. 2. For constant behaviour to me or my teams from a C-Level client I would pull in internally an exec sponsor from my own company to support. I have had my CEO have a meeting with one of my clients CEO #8217;s and give him a very factual update on his SVP #8217;s behaviour and the impact that it was having. To be fair the response was  #8220;We know he #8217;s a dick but it #8217;s effective #8221; but there was a noticeable difference after that meeting occurred. 3. Back everything up in writing. One thing I have found with  #8216;emotional #8217; C-Level execs is they are often looking for leverage in a finger pointing exercise. So if I am working with someone who is highly volatile I send out a summary of the discussion with agreed actions at the end of each meeting or call. Once my actions are completed I close out with a follow up email. This is good business hygeine in general but if someone wants to start throwing handgrenades and sending shittograms they are less likely to point them in the direction of someone that has everything documented.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Why should players have to go to college to play sport? It doesn #8217;t happen anywhere else in major sports outside America. Clubs have their own development programs and it #8217;s not uncommon for soccer players to be playing in the first team at 16/17 years old if they are good enough. Same with golf, tennis, cricket, rugby. Instead of having Universities manage the development the professional game does it. Plenty of these professional sports players still manage to get a degree either during or towards the end of their sports careers.</TEXT>

But as a Lawyer you need to be registered with the relevant professional body. You must declare all convictions (including international).

    <TEXT>If you #8217;ve been there less than 2 years you are out of luck. They can sack you for almost any reason and you can #8217;t claim unfair dismissal. If you have been there more than 2 years, appeal your dismissal and ask for copies of all the evidence collected and any policies that show your emails and IM #8217;s are not private and will be monitored. In your appeal state you were investigated on the basis of an untrue allegation that was not proven. Point to the statements from your coworker that say the content you are being sacked for was a shared joke between freindly colleagues. At this point I would tell them that if your appeal is unsuccessful you will take legal advice and sue for unfair dismissal. They then have 3 options. - Continue to fire you but with the added risk of an unfair dismissal claim - Offer you a compromise agreement (basically pay you to leave and remove the risk of point 1) - Your appeal is successful and you restart working. (I would be careful about accepting a downgraded sanction such as a final written warning in this instance as it could be used to push you out easier in the future).</TEXT>

[There is recent case law in the UK where someone was imprisoned for sexual assault](http://www.thejournal.ie/prosthetic-penis-guilty-2332934-Sep2015/) for lying about their gender with a partner in pretty extraordinary circumstances. The issue of consent is evolving in case law and will continue to as cases come before courts. Performing sex acts on someone without fully disclosing your true gender will ultimately lead to questions about whether that person was really consenting, it could reasonably lead to charges of sexual assault (or rape dependent on the sex act).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>1. I would be amazed if your work could take any reasonable action on the laptop because you were burgled. There is literally no court in the land that wouldn #8217;t tear your employer to pieces if you ended up there. 2. Regarding the council, this could be interpreted as negligence on behalf of the council. The fact that you have a cooberating police statement is useful. I would speak to a local solicitor (free consultation) and then take their advice. Make an inventory of all the item lost and the cost to replace them both new and second hand (eBay average price). Here #8217;s where I think it may fall in your favour - if the inventory is less than a few thousand it will be significantly cheaper for the council to pay it than fight it, and I believe that this definately would pass or be close to a balance of probabilities test. 3.

    <TEXT>Did you read the source I posted  gt;So New York law goes a little bit further than it has to go. The Fifth Amendment protects a defendant who's been tried on a charge once from being tried again. We call that double jeopardy. But it really only applies if you're tried by the same sovereign. There's a little loophole in New York law that apparently was unintended because it provides protection from being tried a second time not just for defendants who were acquitted the first time they were tried on a charge but also for defendants who received a pardon.

The class system is also related to your level of education, your parents education, the type of activities that you are interested in, and your circle of friends. Two people could do the same job for the same salary, one could be working class and one could be upper middle class. It #8217;s more likely that their children would be the same class. The UK class system is incredibly complicated. There is a saying that some people are  #8216;new money #8217;. Just because you become richer doesn #8217;t necessarily jump you up the classes.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It #8217;s not a 3-3-2-2 formation. It #8217;s a 5-3-2 defensively and a 3-5-2 attacking. A lot in that article is absolute nonsense. England conceded the least amount of goals in UEFA qualifying meaning defensively they are incredibly good. The athleticism in the team allows them break quickly so are a threat on the counter attack. The pace of the forwards and their willingness to run behind means teams can #8217;t keep a high line, and can #8217;t play compact high up the pitch. This leads to games where the opposition sit deep and England dominate possession and chances, or when better teams attack England they leave themselves vulnerable to a strong counter attack threat.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You want around 85% of your calories to be coming from Carbohydrates as part of the carb load. You don #8217;t necessarily want to be eating more calories than normal, you #8217;re just pushing up the % that comes from carbs. 15% therefore is split between Fats and Protein which isn #8217;t very much at all, particularly as we are talking about 1 meal here which is the breakfast 3 hours before exercise. A 500 calorie breakfast for example would be 425 calories from carbs and 75 calories from fats and protein. Therefore it #8217;s not so much why no protein but why so much carbs. For every gram of carb stored in your body you can hold an additional 3 grams of water this helps you keep hydrated as you exercise. Also the carbs are stored as glycogen in the muscles and liver. The body is more efficient at using this as an energy source than taking it from fat.</TEXT>

So they have to beat France and then the winner of Brazil/Belgium before the Final. Uruguay are ranked lower than all of those teams. On the other side of the draw England ranked 12th in the world have to beat Sweden and Croatia/Russia to get to the final. All those teams are ranked outside the top 20. Therefore England get shortened odds. Now at 4/1 I did post in one of the threads to back England. I have  #163;50 EW at 20/1 before the tournament started.

Interestingly, it appears that many New York practitioners view the City Bar opinion as the prevailing authority. For example, in a recent  #8220;Attorney Professionalism Forum #8221; in the New York State Bar Association Journal (November/December 2015 at p. 51), the authors described the ethical landscape for New York attorneys as forbidding the secret recording of communications with opposing counsel  #8220;absent some very unusual circumstances. #8221; Id. at 53. #8221; Here #8217;s a link: http://www.newyorklegalethics.com/masking-tapes-an-analysis-of-the-law-of-secret-recording-in-new-york/</TEXT>

Joe is last to go, watching from the start gives a bit more context and adds to the absurdity and funniness of his effort. The clip starts part way through at the start of Joe Wilkinson #8217;s poem. I #8217;d recommend anyone watching to watch from the start. Also the comedians on 8/10 cats are becoming more like sitcom characters in that each of them play up to a certain version of themselves.

This is the Ribeye and cost  #163;7.99 for 300g. I cooked it in butter and basted with Rosemary. I know this is probably on the lower end of ten Wagyu scale but I can #8217;t believe the difference in taste. I normally buy great quality cuts from an amazing local butcher but this was the steakiest tasting steak I #8217;ve had in my life. Plus it kept a beautiful looking colour on the inside.

    <TEXT>Hi u/keysersosa a couple of days ago I received this email. It was titled with my basic password that I used on my reddit account in around 2007 It is just so unfortunate. I am aware [removed] is your pass word. Moreover, I know your secret and I've proof of this. You do not know me personally and nobody paid me to examine you. It's just your hard luck that I came across your misdemeanor. In fact, I placed a malware on the adult vids (porn material) and you visited this web site to experience fun (you know what I mean). While you were watching video clips, your web browser began functioning as a Rdp (Remote control desktop) with a key logger which provided me access to your display screen and cam. After that, my software program gathered every one of your contacts from social networks, and e-mail. After that I put in more time than I probably should have digging into your life and generated a double screen video. 1st part displays the recording you had been watching and second part shows the view of your web camera (its you doing dirty things). Honestly, I am ready to forget all information about you and let you continue with your regular life. And I am going to provide you two options which will achieve that. These two options are either to ignore this letter, or perhaps pay me $1200. Let us examine these two options in details. Option One is to ignore this e mail. You should know what will happen if you opt this option. I will send out your video to your entire contacts including close relatives, colleagues, and so forth. It does not help you avoid the humiliation your self will face when friends and family learn your unpleasant videos from me. Second Option is to send me $1200. We #8217;ll name it my  #8220;privacy charges #8221;. Now lets see what will happen if you pick this option. Your secret will remain your secret. I will destroy the video immediately. You keep your daily life as if none of this ever occurred. Now you may be thinking,  #8220;I should call the cops #8221;. Without a doubt, I've covered my steps to ensure this e mail cannot be traced time for me and yes it won't prevent the evidence from destroying your life. I'm not trying to dig a hole in your pocket. I am just looking to get compensated for time I placed into investigating you. Let's assume you've decided to create this all disappear and pay me my confidentiality fee. You'll make the payment by Bitcoin (if you don't know how, type "how to buy bitcoins" in google) Transfer Amount: $1200 Bitcoin Address to Send: 1P4xHsXFXHK*ZrBJ5jCdSoNptHb3N6hXEuM ( You must Remove * from this string and copy and paste it carefully) Expalin no-one what you would be transferring the bitcoin for or they might not give it to you. The task to get bitcoins will take a few days so do not put it off. I have a specific pixel in this email message, and now I know that you've read through this mail. You have 48 hours to make the payment. If I do not get the BitCoins, I definitely will send your video to all your contacts including family members, coworkers, and so on. You better come up with an excuse for friends and family before they find out. Having said that, if I receive the payment, I'll destroy the proof and all other proofs immediately. It is a non negotiable one time offer, thus kindly do not waste my personal time  amp; yours. Your time has started. You should be aware that my malware will still be keeping tracking of the actions you adopt when you are done reading this message. To be honest, If I see any wrong activity from your browser history then I will have to send out your sextape to your close relatives, colleagues before your time finishes. Edit: Just to add I knew it was a scam. I received the email on July 31st at 02:55am. This was the only account that I used that basic password that has had a security scare recently. I posted the full email just so people could maybe see the consequence of the hack. Happy to provide the email to Reddit admins if it helps locate the hacker.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You can #8217;t leave the country and rent your flat out if the economy tanks into a recession. It #8217;s against the terms of the mortgage. Sometimes you can pay to get a consent to let, however there is very little chance of them granting this if they know you are out of the country. There is a calculation you can do that shows financial benefit of buying versus renting. Once you add in all of your fees and interest on a high LTV mortgage then at 4-5 years buying is very unlikely to be the right financial decision.</TEXT>
