    <TITLE>DAE feel like music is less special because of mp3 players?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2009-11-30 22:17:17</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've had an MP3 player, in some form, for five years now. For those five years I've had my entire music collection at my disposal everywhere I go. I'm starting to wonder if music is less special to me because of my immediate access to it. I no longer spend hours carefully burning CDs or making mix tapes. I no longer go to the record store to purchase new music. I remember that excitement I felt on my way home with a new CD. I remember ripping open that annoying plastic cover and popping open the case to admire the wonderful liner art. I remember leaving that CD at home while I was at school and thinking about how much I wanted to go home to listen to that CD. Don't get me wrong; music is as important to me now as it ever was. I'm just wondering if music has lost any of the magic that it had when I was younger.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So I've been biking here in Chicago for a few years now. I generally bike every day from march to late october...except on days when it's raining any more than a sprinkle. Seeing as a hoodie clearly won't cut it...what do all of you wear in the rain? I was looking at picking up [this waterproof](http://www.charlesriverapparel.com/CGI-BIN/LANSAWEB?WEBEVENT+LD288030783E12300F1E6058+A01+ENG) jacket, but I'm worried about overheating (I sweat a ton as is). What about hoods? How do I wear a hood with a helmet? Any advice is greatly appreciated.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Just Dance - in that Gay, Sunday Morning kinda way</TITLE>
    <DATE>2010-09-18 22:00:36</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi there- When was the last time you were invited to a dance party at 11 AM on a Sunday morning? Right. Okay. So. There were a couple of scenes from THE WISE KIDS that we were not able to grab during principal photography in Charleston SC, so we are picking them up this Sunday, September 19th. One of them is an invigorating scene in the film where our newly/not quite out gay character goes clubbing with his friend for the first time. So we need to fill in the gay club (bar, dance floor, etc.) with a relatively wide variety of men and women. I'd say we're looking at mostly male, some female, mostly 18-35, some 35-60. Various shapes, sizes, etc. We'll be at the not-so-glamorous-but-super-friendly-and-entirely-Charleston-appropriate Charlie's, 3726 N. Broadway. Come join! Bring your friends! And please forward this on! If you can recruit a few folks, just write me and let me know how many you at least probably have coming (if that makes sense - in other words, I don't need to know maybes, but would love to know, if possible, probablys and definitelys). We'll need you at 11 AM (scene takes place at night, but we'll black out what needs to be blacked out). Folks should plan to stay until 4 PM, but may be released as early as 1 PM. Wear what you'd wear out. If you'd like to come, just email me at SethKFarley@gmail.com</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So I'm in the market for a single-speed. I'm making the jump from a 14 speed. I've been riding for a few years, but I still have yet to learn about what to look for in a quality bike. I basically just know to stay away from high-tension steel frames. Anywho, I live in Chicago, so hills won't be an issue. I'm just looking for something that will be able to handle 150 miles a week. I probably won't be able to spend more than $500, either. Any advice would be helpful.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Hey r/auto, my car 1988 Volvo GL wagon is having issues.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2011-02-21 23:56:54</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I was driving the car home last night around Chicago (where it was raining all day). I was driving underneath this bridge where I saw what I thought to be a little puddle. That puddle turned out to be 18 to 24 inches deep. The car got through it, but died immediately after. The car started up when I turned on the ignition but then died about a mile later. I tried turning it on - the engine would start but never turn over. I let the car sit for about an hour (thinking water might have gone up the tailpipe) but it never started. I left the car overnight and tried it again today. It started right up on my first try. I let it idle for about 2 minutes, and then it died. I haven't been able to start it since. Any ideas? I really don't know anything about cars, so any bit of help is appreciated. I also home this is the correct subreddit to post this :\</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey everyone, I'm working on a travel documentary for British television on Route 66. We've been on the road now for a little over 7 weeks, and we're about to end it on Santa Monica peer in a few days. Over the last couple of days we've had a couple of segments cancel on us, leaving us a bit short. I was wondering if any of you might know any good attractions or stops near route 66 is LA. Old Route 66 follows Santa Monica Boulevard through the hearts of Beverly Hills and West Hollywood. East from Hollywood, Route 66 merges into Sunset Boulevard for the long winding drive to downtown L.A., ending up at the historic core of the city: Olvera Street and the Plaza de Los Angeles State Historic Park. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So I'm a bit late to the owning a car game at the age of 25. I'm from Chicago where a car just isn't needed. Anywho, I'm moving to LA next week and you do need a car there. The thing is I really don't have a lot of money I can spend on one. I'd like to spend a maximum of $3500, but of course lower would be great. I know that it will probably be difficult to find a good car at the price that can handle the hills and the freeway. To make matters worse I don't really know a thing about cars. What sort of things should I look for in used cars to indicate if they're worth it or not. I know the obvious is to see what the miles are at, but that's about it. Any help is GREATLY appreciated.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think it would be kind of fun to make mix-cds and mail them to complete strangers. It would also be cool to receive some in return. If there was enough interest on reddit, maybe we can make this happen. It would be a great way to share good music with people, and to discover new things yourself. The only thing is that I don't know the best way to implement it. What do you think?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>5 day shoot cancelled on day one. Invoice question</TITLE>
    <DATE>2011-11-25 20:56:20</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi there, I just have a question about cancelled shoots. Of course, we've all dealt with getting a gig, only for it to be cancelled before-hand. However, I've never experienced an entire shoot to be cancelled on day one, just hours before call. I'm lucky, that I was actually able to put in two days of work tying up loose ends (I do production work). But the thing is, I've turned down a lot of other work this week, and two days is only two days. What do you all suggest I do as far as an invoice? The company, which is a good company with whom I do a fair amount of work with, has asked what my cancellation fee/policy is...and I have no idea. A little more info...it was a shoot for British tv (shooting in LA). The production company is huge, and produces shows for MTV, ITV, BBC, etc. My role was Production Coordinator. And I was able to salvage two of the five days. Also, I was not able to find replacement work. Edit: Thanks for the tips everyone! I'm going to go with the "middle of the road" route. I'll update.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Okay, so my girlfriend and I moved into an apartment in Echo Park on June 1st. We immediately found a bug problem - ants and roaches. We let management know immediately. They did nothing immediately, but we set traps and the ant problem went away. Then, about three weeks later, we started seeing more and more cockroaches. We let management know, and about 2 weeks after that they finally sprayed our apartment. That seemed to have only dented the issue, as we continue to have a problem with roaches. I've spent all week emailed and calling me landlord. She has not gotten back to us once. Here is the text in the emails: *"This email is notify you that we are still having a bug problem in unit #4 of the 218 Lake Shore Terrace building. It has been just over 2 weeks since the exterminator came to spray for cockroaches. The cockroaches remain Please confirm that you have received this email."* What can I do? Edit: I should say that we really want to stay in the problem. I know that cockroaches mean the apartment is legally "uninhabitable" and as such we can move out and get our deposit. However, we want to stay.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've had this idea for a while now, and I seriously doubt I'm the first one, but I would be really interested in a prequel to Ocarina of Time centered around Ganondorf's rise to power. The story would start with his banishment to the sacred realm, which would be portrayed initially as a drab prison. He escapes, and goes through various trials to regain his strength, before, at the end of the game, escaping from The Sacred Realm to Ocarina of Time Hyrule. As far as gameplay, I think that the dungeons could be set up similarly, but playing as Ganondorf should mean the use of magic is emphasized much more. What do you think?</TEXT>

I like that trade because Big Buff can play D and RW. Plus, he takes a lot of shots, hits and PIMs. My main concern is that, outside of Lundqvist, I don't have any monsters on my team. You could make the argument for Sedin, but I think he only had like 81 pts last season. I'm also concerned about Varlomov, but I'm hoping that his european playtime...where he was doing very very well....will translate over here. What do you all think?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Okay, so I have a friend here in LA that is producing a TV show that is similar to Kitchen Nightmares...but for tattoo shops. I've agreed to go on camera at a shop here to get a tattoo. The problem is, of course, I have no idea of what to get. It has to be small, and can't contain logos....I wanted to get a Pittsburgh Penguins tattoo... I already have two tattoos. I have [this](http://0.tqn.com/d/arthistory/1/0/G/_/fr04_matisse.jpg) on my right arm, and a black tree on my left shoulder. About me....I'm a filmmaker. I love all of the arts. I like OLD punk rock. I love cartoons. Hockey is my favorite sport. I currently live in LA...moved here from Chicago (which is my favorite city), and spent the first 18 years of my life in Kansas. I know a few tattoos that I want, but they can't do them for the show due to logos and length of time to complete them.... Ugh...I feel lame posting this here. I should be able to figure this out. Maybe I'll look in some of my art books.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2013-02-17 01:10:46</DATE>
    <TEXT>Okay, so to start off, I'll just say that I cheat a lot when I make hamburgers. Like....big time. What I do is I put my ground beef (usually the least lean I can find at my local grocery store) in a big bowl with a TON of A1 sauce, worcestershire sauce and a variety of spices. But seriously...a TON of A1. Sometime's I'll also add some chorizo that I've already browned... And my burgers are DELICIOUS. Everyone thinks so, as well. The problem is....because I use so much liquid, they tend to be extremely loose and crumbly. I've tried to add egg and/or breadcrumbs to marginal success....but that really makes me feel like I'm making mini meatloaf patties and not burgers. Does anyone have any advise on to how to make my burgers solid?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So I was a very active youngster. I was a wrestler from ages 6 - 18, and a cross country runner from 14 - 18. I even ran a couple of marathons in my teens.

But then college hit, and I haven't really worked out ever since....outside of bicycling around Chicago for a few years (though, I haven't biked in about 2 years). Anyway, I'm looking at turning this all around. Starting Monday I will be starting a new low-carb diet/counting calories, and I'm going to start running. My question has to do with the running - would it be beneficial to get a heart monitor? We used them when I ran for my high school x-country team. Reading about them now, they seem to be helpful for both weight loss and cardiovascular exercise. What do you all think? A little more info....since I stopped exercising I went from being 150lbs to now weighing in at about 185-190lbs.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I need some advice regarding a catalytic convertor for a 2002 Toyota Camry LE</TITLE>
    <DATE>2013-06-18 23:56:13</DATE>
    <TEXT>First of all, I really hope that this is the right subreddit...I apologize if it's not. I recently just bought a 2002 Toyota Camry LE 4 cylinder in Kansas City MO, and drove it to Los Angeles CA, where I live. The former owner took amazing care of the care and had all paperwork for any work done on it. Even though it's 11 years old...it drives very, very smoothly. Before I drove it to LA, I took to my family's mechanic of over 20 years to make sure everything was okay with it. The only problem was the catalytic convertor, which I was told to get replaced here in CA, as they use different catalytic converters here than the rest of the country. Anyway, I get to LA and I call a shop. The person on the phone quotes me at $450 for parts and labor. Today, I brought my car in to get the work done. About an hour after I dropped the car off, I get a call from the place, and they tell me that it will now be $1400 to get it replaced. He said the Camry had two catalytic converters that needed to be replaced, and that there were some sensors that also needed to be replaced. He also said that I needed all sorts of things replaced (struts for the front and back, valve cover leaking, wiper blades - why does a mechanic care about wiper blade?). These are all contrary to what the mechanic in KC told me... I left for 2 reasons....the first is that I don't have $1400. The second is that it just seemed sort of sketchy to me. I called the mechanic in KC and he told me a couple of things that made it seem sketchy as well. First, he told me that he didn't think my Camry had two catalytic converters, but admitted he could be wrong. Second, he told me if I had the converters replaced in KC, it would only be $250 parts and labor. Anyway...I don't know much about cars. I hope what I'm saying makes sense. I would go shopping around, but I had to eat a $90 diagnostics check at this shop in LA...I don't want to keep getting stuck with those just looking for accurate estimates.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>The perfect corn tortillas for tacos?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2013-09-02 04:01:03</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I've been making tacos for years...and I am damn good at it. But the weak link in my taco making always seems to be the tortillas. For those wondering, I use yellow corn tortillas. I used to brush them all with water and heat them in the microwave...and that worked okay at best. But I got rid of my microwave. For the past two years, I've simply been heating them up individually with some oil in a pan. As I go on, I stack them up together, and then when I have finished them all, I wrap them in foil to preserve heat. And they always taste pretty good. My question is this...doing them individually like it do - I do this because I am also cooking the meat so I can't divide my attention too much - takes a lot of time. Is there any way to get the same effect some other way? Maybe using the oven?</TEXT>

I'm trying to play devices through HDMI, (Xbox, Apple TV, Blue Ray Player), so I can't connect them directly to the receiver. My next move was to connect the tv to the receiver via a digital optical cable...and I'm not having any luck with that. I've turned off the tv's internal speakers, but beyond that, I'm at a loss. I guess my question is whether or not the optical cable is the way to go, and if it is, what am I doing wrong? I feel like it has something to do with the receiver. Next to the optical audio input it says "video 2 in", so I select "video 2", but I still get nothing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey guys, So, I'm a die-hard Penguins fan. I feel in love with them when I was seven years old (in 1993), and have been a huge fan ever since. However, I have never been able to go to a game due to location (grew in in Kansas) and later finances. That changed a few nights ago, where I was able to see The Pens take on the Kings at The Staples Center (I live in LA now). I HAD AN AMAZING TIME!! And I have to say....that was due in large part because of you Kings fans at the game. I had been to NHL games in the past. I used to live in Chicago, so I had seen a few games there. My first road game was to see the Blackhawks play at Anaheim last season....and what a bunch of shitty fans they were. Not only were the Ducks fans rude to Hawks fans, a lot of them just didn't know shit about hockey. I had the complete opposite experience at The Staples Center. I was in the middle of a big group of Kings fans...and they were great. They were friendly. They liked getting into some friendly shit-talking. They knew about the game of hockey and the team (They all knew that the pen's netminder for the game, Zatkoff, was drafted by the Kings in '06, for instance). Again...just wanted to say thanks. I've been a fan of this team for over 20 years. And then I finally got to see them, and you all made it a great experience. Let's go Pens! Go Kings Go!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Did I let a potential robber into my home?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2014-03-11 06:14:44</DATE>
    <TEXT>So, this morning I was awoken by a knock at the door a little after 8am. If was someone from DWP, or at least that's what I thought. He had on the uniform and was driving a van with the insignia. He said he was here to figure out a problem that my landlord, whose name he knew, brought up with DWP. He had me walk him around the property to show him the meters. All standard affair. But then he did something that I still can't figure out. He asked to come inside, and of course I let him on. Once inside he started taking photos - this is where the alarms in my head started going off. They seemed to just be general photos, but I can't figure out why he needed them. All day I've just been wondering if he was just getting into the place to see what kind of stuff we have inside. Taking photos to see where the good stuff is, so that when he comes back he can get to it quicker. And that he knew my landlord's name doesn't hold a whole lot of weight. First of all, he thought that my landlord lives at the house - he seemed surprised when someone else answered the door. Secondly, my landlord still receives mail at this place, and our mailbox is very accessible. That actually happened at an old apartment...a guy tried breaking in, and when caught he used my name because he read it from the mail box. Anyway, what do you all think? Ps: typed this all on my iPhone. Apologies for typos. UPDATE: I called DWP's Security Services, as [lasdlt](http://www.reddit.com/r/LosAngeles/comments/2047gd/did_i_let_a_potential_robber_into_my_home/cfznnwy) suggested. They agreed that what happened was strange. According to them there is absolutely no reason for a someone to take photos inside the home. He instructed me to call my local police station, which I did. The officer who I spoke with didn't seem too concerned. I got the "Well what do you want me to do about it?" treatment. I finally spoke with my landlord today, and he actually confirmed that he was expected someone from DWP to come by. Although, he was under the impression that the DWP person would call him before he came over. This guy may, or may not be a robber. However, even if he is, my house is pretty secure. We have an iron gate that surrounds the whole property which we keep locked at all times. We don't leave doors unlocked. We have two large dogs, a boxer and a pitbull. This just serves as a reminder to stay vigilant.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2014-03-25 22:42:56</DATE>
    <TEXT>This might sound insane, but bear with me. Brandon Sutter has been getting a lot of attention lately for his sub-par play. He was even demoted to the 4th line. I'm wondering if getting a chance to play with Neal and Jokinen is just what he needs to get his confidence back, and raise his game. We are certainly going to see his numbers increase. And perhaps, upon Geno's return, he can take some of that 2nd line offense back down to the third line with him. This is kind if silly, I know, but what are your thoughts?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Obviously we have had some amazing net-minders in the history of the sport. But I wonder if there could ever be one good enough to be labeled as the best hockey player in the world. I feel like it's a lot easier to give that title to a skater, because people just see them do more. They play offense and they play defense. They win faceoffs and they block shots. Goalies just stop the puck from entering the net (that's a bit glib, I know).</TEXT>

    <TITLE>How does a team like the Blackhawks not lose their cool when down?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2014-05-31 21:21:08</DATE>
    <TEXT>This is something that the penguins do time and time again. They get down in a game, or in a series, and beat themselves mentally. Part of me thinks that, for the Blackhawks, it has a lot to do with Toews. He's the captain of the team, and when push comes to shove, he always keeps his cool. On the pens, you have a few elite players that do the opposite. Crosby certainly hits panic mode every now and then. Sometimes the frustration pays off, but usually it doesn't. (See: 2012 Pens-Flyers series) Malkin has the same thing. When down he does two things - tries to carry the whole team single-handedly and takes awful penalties. Every now and then he enters beast-mode when frustrated, which is great. However, it's not sustainable. Neal...we all know what happens to Neal. I don't know...it's the off-season for the pens and I'm just theorizing. Maybe Crosby needs to take a look at how Toews handles himself, and the effect that it has on his team. What do you all think?</TEXT>

Usually I brine chicken, so I'll let it sit for long period of time, but should I be worried about the lemon juice "cooking" the chicken if it's marinating too long?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Should I get a PS3 or PS4?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2015-04-18 23:43:10</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I'm finally able to join the current gen and this go-around I want to go the Playstation Route. Up to now I'm a staunch nintendo guy, and I have all of their consoles in addition to an X-Box 360. I also own a PS2. In doing research for the upgrade, I've discovered that the PS4 is NOT backwards compatible, and having missed the PS3 a few games that I want to play are on that system - MGS4, Heavy Rain and Red Dead Redemption (which I suppose I can just get on 360) being the big three. The Last of Us is also a big title I want to play, but it seems to have a port on PS4. I'm admittedly out of the loop as far as what games are out there and what's good. As far as the PS4 goes, the only two games that stick out to me are Destiny and Journey (Last of Us, as well). But beyond that, I'm pretty clueless. So my question is this...There are more games on the PS3 that I KNOW I want to play. However, I'm willing to skip it if its worth it. Is there any chance the games I've mentioned will be ported over? That sure would make the decision easier. Lastly, though cost between the two consoles doesn't matter much to me, I cannot afford to buy both. What do you all think?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Okay, so my Mom is coming to town, and I want to treat her to some amazing steak prepared by yours truly. I found a very highly regarded butcher in town, Los Angeles, who sells some two inch thick dry aged ribeyes. Normally what I'll do is salt a steak about 24 hours in advance with course kosher salt. I sear it in my cast iron and finish in the oven. I only normally cook for myself. Should I be worried about cooking two steaks in my cast iron? Should I go out and get another cast iron and start seasoning the hell out of it? Also, I've never cooked anything that thick before. Does my technique still work? I've also never cooked a dry-aged steak before. Anything different with that bad boy? Should I still salt it?</TEXT>

    <DATE>2015-06-16 21:04:31</DATE>
    <TEXT>A lot of folks who are new to the industry don't understand how important your work attire is. We're working long days and being comfortable and ready for the elements is important. I thought it would be fun and informative if we shared what we find best to wear to set. I personally have some different sets of work-wear. What I wear on location is usually very different from a controlled studio show. On location I typically wear things that are light and breath easy. Brightly colored t-shirts (so people can always find me). Light-weight cargo shorts. I usually work in LA, so I hardly ever have to wear long pants. For studio shows I'll usually dress a bit nicer as there are usually important clients or execs around. So I'll wear a button-up with some cargo pants. As for footwear, I again have different things for different scenarios. I'm typically wearing [these salomon trail running shoes](http://www.salomon.com/us/product/xa-pro-3d-m-.html?article=359380). They're pretty good in all situations as they are durable, have great grip and are comfortable. I also have a waterproof option, and some standard running shoes for very hot days. I always make sure to have everything I would need to face the elements in my car. Rain gear (SUPER IMPORTANT TO HAVE THIS). Jackets/Cold Weather gear. Sun Hats (multiple because I always lose them). Extra socks. Safety Vests. One thing that I'm still not happy with are the sun hats that I find. The big wicker ones are terrible. Uncomfortable and unwieldy. I've tried some other options, but I'm still not happy. Do you guys have any suggestions?</TEXT>

On top of the logo I want to put a phrase that just screams the penguins. I'm thinking about doing "Buckle Up Baby!" but I'm wondering if there's something that is more appropriate. Like, I know that a team like the Blackhawks has "Commit" or "Commit To The Indian". What do you guys think? Obviously Mike Lange has a bunch.

    <DATE>2015-11-19 19:45:10</DATE>
    <TEXT>So, I just picked up the hobby a little while ago. I've made three models (all aircraft) and I'm having some trouble figuring out the order to do things. Particularly when it comes to airbrushing. I have a problem with following the included directions too closely perhaps. I go in the order that it says, and I paint the pieces individually before cementing them together. It worked out fine for the first two models, but now that I'm trying to add airbrushing into the mix. Currently I'm about to complete a Revel 1:48 Mig 29, and I want to airbrush the camo pattern on it. The problem that I have is that the construction is complete. I have the landing gear down. Drop tanks and missiles installed...and I think that's where I messed up... How am I supposed to airbrush this thing? Do I have to mask out every piece I don't want to airbrush (landing gear...missiles, etc)? Do I pull it apart...and if I do how do I even do that safely? In general...when you know you want to airbrush the fuselage and other parts...at what point is it appropriate to do this? Before you start attaching all of the other parts?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So I have a tricky situation here. I live in a house in Cypress park with my awesome pitbull. We've had this elderly neighbor who has been harassing my dog for the past year. What he'll do is just hang by our fence and taunt our dog until my dog is barking up a storm. And then when we come out to make our dog come inside he complains about the barking. I should point out that we always make our dog come indoors immediately when he's barking. Anywho, it got worse today. I was fixing breakfast when I heard my dog barking like crazy. I go outside to see this dude right at our fence, blowing smoke in my dog's face. As soon as I come out he says "he's waking up the whole neighborhood!". I told him to leave my dog alone and brought the pup inside. Any of you have to deal with something like this? We generally have a great neighborhood. Everyone is really nice to each other and everyone loves our dog. Except this one guy who just so happens to live next door.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2017-05-06 19:53:27</DATE>
    <TEXT>31 yo, male, 5 foot , 180lbs. The problem started yesterday morning right when I woke up. I had no problems with the knee whatsoever the day before. The pain is in my knee, and it's mostly in a very specific spot. It's right below the patella on what I assume is the bump where the tibia meets the knee. I get some pretty intense pain when I move my leg in certain ways. Any sort of bending on the knee hurts. It also hurts if I'm prostrate and I raise that leg up. Sitting down hurts. It also hurts to the touch. Icing seems to help to a degree. I'm pretty active. I go hiking pretty often (though I haven't been in a couple weeks). My job requires me to be moving on my feet throughout the day. I've never had issues with my knees before, outside of having Osgood Schlatter's when I was a kid. I'm posting here because I lost my insurance a couple of months ago. I'm getting new insurance through work, but it won't kick in until July 1st. My question is how long I should go with trying home remedies (ice, rest, etc) before I go in to the doctor.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Brisket is too big for vertical smoker. I'll need to cut it down, but I have a few questions about that.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-05-27 06:02:11</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hey pitmasters, I'm a novice at this game, but I have myself a vertical smoker that I love. However, the width means I can't smoke a large whole brisket. I just picked up a 15lb brisket for Monday. I knew full well it was too big when I bought it. My plan this whole time was to cut it down. What's the best method to doing this? Should I simply separate the point and flat? How do I calculate cooking time with the smaller portions? I would assume that I just need to weigh the sections and go from there, but I'm wondering if having both pieces in the smoker means that they need to go a little longer. Sorry if that sounds dumb...like I said, I'm a novice.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So I picked up a 5 pack of boneless beef chuck short rip from Costco the other day. I just got it on a whim...I was there to buy brisket and ribs for memorial day smoking. Anywho, I've never done shortribs on any kind. I figure I'll follow the same formula as brisket except skipping the wrapping part. But, if any of you have any better ideas I'd love to hear em.

    <TEXT>My buds and I are talking about doing an all-seafood cook next weekend. I've only ever done ribs, brisket and short rib before, so this is gonna be a new experience. What are some of your favorite smoked seafood recipes? The thing I'm most excited to try is smoked scallops. Though I'm not finding any exciting recipes. I figure I should just use some rubs on them and then smoke with a light smoke for about 40 minutes. How does that sound?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Man. This is tough. I went through the same thing here in the USA. Drunk dad who got physical. I learned a couple of tricks to deal with it. First, I figured out what would trigger him. And when I saw it going that way I'd change the conversation to something he liked...sports usually. I figured out ways to diffuse things. But that was not 100% effective. I was lucky because as I got older, I got bigger than my father. But beyond that, the thing that got me through it the most was the fact that I knew I was going to move away to college. Having that light at the end of the tunnel helped me deal with the trauma at home. I know that you don't have that same goal, but I wonder if you can get one. Figure out what can take you out of that house and do what you can to deal with the pain until then. This all assumes that you don't think you can talk to anyone else about this. Do you have a teacher or adult who cares about you? I don't really know how things work in Brazil, but if a student talks to a teacher about things like this in the USA there's automatically an investigation.</TEXT>

I call this doing your homework. And she absolutely needs to do the same...that's where the honest conversation comes in. You need to figure out what you need from her, and what she needs from you. And vice versa. It's also possible that you two are just growing apart. Which is unfortunate, but it happens. Especially at such a young age. Whatever happens, good luck dude. I've been there. It hurts.</TEXT>

On my gas stove I can get a cast iron up to around 800F and it gets a pretty good crust. Check out these two posts I made and see if that's what you're talking about. [Picanha](https://imgur.com/gallery/1qK9h), [Ribeye](https://imgur.com/a/6yl8W). I prefer sous vide because softens up fat much better than simply on the stove. I prefer ribeyes and I like them rare, so I always found that the fat was always too hard when I just use the stove.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No no no. You do not boil the water. You make sure that the water is at a constant temp that corresponds to the doneness you like in a steak. If you like medium rare you keep the steak at 135. Rare 130, etc. /u/justdoit84 check this video out. https://youtu.be/LuG7zrU-Uw0</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well, one thing I would say is that the cast iron skillet probably needs to be hotter than it would be for your method. I recently invested in an infrared thermometer, and it's helped a ton in figuring out when my pan is ready for the steak. And it's also helped me figure out how to get it hotter...I learned that if I angle the pan just so it gets another 100 or so degrees. That being said though...I'd say it's worth trying these other methods out....but I know your method rules too. If you like it then keep doing it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There's really no right answer here. Each director is different. Stanley Kubrick had control over every single creative decision in each and every one of his movies. JJ Abrams give his cast and crew every opportunity to contribute to the creative process. Just find what works for you. That being said, there's a really strong chance that your DP, designer, editor, etc know more about their craft than you do. I will say that this girl sounds ridiculous. Every professional knows that the director is in charge of the vision...and he/she can choose to be a big collaborator or not. It's up to him or her...not the crew. I'm curious to know what sort of level this shoot was. You mentioned school. Is this high school? College? Is this a film program?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's gotta be 2016 for me. First of all, I think that was easily the best Penguins team of this century. But more than that it's all about the insanity of the regular season. We had players like Sid unable to contribute under Mike Johnston's coaching. And then they fired Johnston and brought in Sullivan. And that's when it started to really get good. Sullivan instituted a new system that played to the team's strength. And then Rutherford started bringing in players like Hagelin and Bonino. Players that we never knew that we needed...but they made all the difference. Goddamn I love you GMJR!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I grew up as a wrestler. About 15 years ago I was a senior and I was in the state finals. I was up by one with about 10 seconds left. And because of a really horrible call by the ref my opponent was awarded a point. I lost the match in 2nd overtime. Was I mad at the ref? Of course. But I didn #8217;t lose because of the ref. I lost because I didn #8217;t get it done in OT.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I disagree with your playcall assessment. If they would have run on any one of those plays then K-State has to use at least one timeout. And K-State won because they had one timeout to spare. Also, I absolutely agree with you that the PI was a good flag. However I do not agree that by picking up the flag the refs gave the game to Kansas State. Iowa State still had a defense that could have taken the field and won the game. But they didn't. I agree that you should be mad at the refs. But you should also be mad at your team. The refs made some mistakes. But your team still had a job to do.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I proposed to my girl somewhat randomly. At the time we had been together for 5 years. I knew that I was gonna propose at some point that year - I just didn #8217;t know when/where. One night we found ourselves on vacation at Big Bear Lake CA. We had this awesome day of hiking and a nice dinner. That night we were looking at the stars in our cabin #8217;s hot-tub while drinking bourbon and listening to Tom Waits. I knew it wasn #8217;t gonna get any better than that so I popped the question. She said yes and we get married next year. I didn #8217;t have a ring at the time, because I wasn #8217;t expecting to ask on this trip. And let me tell you that was a good thing. We decided it was important to find a ring from Big Bear, so the following day we went to look at rings. Everything that I was picking out was getting shot down. And thank goodness. The ring she picked was about 3x less expensive as everything I was picking.</TEXT>

I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong, but it comes out dry every time. Just tonight I made some ahi tuna. I cooked it from frozen at 115 for about an hour (extra time to account for defrost). I took it out, seasoned it, and dried off the surface. I put it in my cast iron to sear once my skillet hit 600 degrees. And then.....dryness. What am I doing wrong?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was living in Chicago then. Before and after that I would hang out at a big Blackhawks bar (The Whirlaway for you Chicagoans). And when they started broadcasting more games the fan base literally grew before my own eyes in that bar. What started as just a few fans there to watch games became this huge event during the playoffs. It was so cool, especially when I got to be at that same bar when the hawks won the cup in 2010.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I used to do it every now and then in middle school. It would always trip a circuit so that outlet would be useless for a while. Once I did it right before we were supposed to watch some video. I did it as the teacher left to go get the roll-in TV setup (yes, this was back in the 90s) and when she came back in the TV wouldn't turn on. She spent all class trying to figure it out. We didn't learn anything that day - it was awesome.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2017-12-22 22:40:52</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hey folks, So I just received the above mentioned dish as an early xmas gift. And I'd love to utilize it for my x-mas eve rib roast. However, in reading the included manual something popped out at me which worries me. According to cuisinart, this dish cannot be placed in an oven that's hotter than 350 degree F. And I'm going to start my rib roast at 500. Okay, I won't use it. I'll just use my standard CI skillet. No problem. But I just wonder why it can't be in the oven past 350. It seems crazy to make a CI dish that can't go past that. Is it the enamel? Also, the included booklet says that this is dishwasher safe, despite the fact that there's exposed CI. Yeeeeeeah right. Link to the product here: https://www.cuisinart.com/products/cookware/EnameledCastIron/casserole_ccec/ci755-30cr.html</TEXT>

I lost player 1 to a person who has a waiver priority of 3, and I lost player 2 to a person who has a priority of 10. How did I lose both of these guys?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ah. I see. At the time I lost player 1 to a person, who at the time, had higher priority than me. But here's where it's confusing. The second waiver claim for player 2 doesn't show up at all.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Oh my friend. There's no other way to do a ribeye than sous vide. I used to do it your way with just the cast iron sear. And it's great.

    <TEXT>That looks great! However, I think you might want your pan to get a bit hotter before the sear. Looks like it #8217;s quite a bit more cooked just under the crust compared to the center. That being said, this still looks bomb.com. Good work.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Bravo, bud. We never went past 12 on the last movie that I did. Afterward the producer/UPM and I were talking about this. He was saying, much like yourself, that he also wanted to experiment with 8-10 hour days. It's crazy to think how even just a 2 hour difference is huge. It's Friday and you have a 6am call. You're off at 4:30pm. Holy cow. A shoot like this would have zero morale issues.</TEXT>

But it we were always teased with Goku and co. saying stuff like "It felt a lot like Zamasu's energy, but it was different." And I'm wondering if this is the same Zamasu that Goku beat on the Kai planet. If he just went to the future and has harbored resentment against Goku this whole time.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Gonna try a hot wing cook for the first time for the final for. Any tips?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-03-29 02:58:00</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hey folks, As the title states, I'm going to be doing my first hot wings this weekend. I've been looking at a few recipes and I think I have my method down, but I'd love to hear any tips or advice for you guys as well. Here's how I plan on doing it. Find some nice wings...with lots of meat on them. I'm going to separate the wings at the joint...maybe I can find some already separated. Defrost if necessary. Marinate overnight in italian dressing with a little bit of soy sauce and worcestershire and some seasoning. The next day I will apply a dry rub - I'll keep it simple with SPG and a dash of BBQ rub. Get the smoker up to 250. I'm unsure of which wood I'm going to use at this moment. Any tips? Smoke wings for one hour. Add hot wing glaze to wings. Finish in smoker for another hour. Pull from smoker and serve and DEVOUR! How does this seem to you all? Do I have anything wrong? Any tips or tricks that I'm not thinking of?</TEXT>

Also there #8217;s always a little leftover oil from when I cleaned it last (I use grape seed). Although to be honest I did get a fireball once and it turned out to be one of the best sears I ever got  #128521;.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I usually do 129F for 2 hours. Before you bag it season it however you like. I do SP amp;G. I also throw some fresh rosemary and thyme in the bag with some crushed garlic in there as well. Afterward I heat up my cast iron pan to over 600F. I will also melt some butter with fresh thyme, rosemary and crushed garlic. Take the steaks out of the bag and pat at dry as possible on all edges. Then into the screaming hot skillet they go. I usually count to 30 for each side - basting the other side with the herbed butter - and then flip. I'll judge the sear and flip again if I need to. Basting the whole way. You don't have to follow this sear method. Use a grill or torch or whatever you want. But you absolutely have to pat the steaks dry.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah. That happened in the dub. He turns SSJ and punches Trunks - launching him back. And then there are a few scenes and we cut back. They #8217;re are standing towards each other. Young Trunks is still SSJ. Future Trunks is normal, but now young Trunks is out of breath and says he can keep going. It just seems like we missed something.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The good thing about being a 1st is I set call times. Back in 2016 I got hired for this pilot. As it turned out we were going to shoot during game 6 of the SCF. Obviously I couldn't miss the game. So I made call time 4am, and I scheduled the day in a way where it ended really easy and I could have my 2nd take over the last hour or so. So I went over to this room by myself and watched the first period. We wrapped during the period. Once they blew the whistle I sped home and walked in the door right as they dropped the puck for the 2nd period. I didn't miss a single second and we won the cup. That show later went on to become Viceland's What Would Diplo Do. hahah</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I thought it was one of the best I've seen from any of the Dragon Ball series. What got me was the interaction between Future Trunks and Young Trunks. He explained what we, as the audience, already know. But, with young Trunks he did it in a way that very clearly helped young Trunks grow up a little bit. YT was obsessed with the idea that him and FT were the same person since the start of this arc. But in this episode FT showed him how that thought is impossible. And when YT realized that he understood how dire FT's world is. And I think I saw that it filled him with sadness.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>According to The Food Lab the science behind resting meat is so that the temperature gradient inside the meat evens out. Meaning the a rare steak has a cool center while hot on the outside. They then go on to say that because a sous vide streak is the same temperature from edge to edge - meaning resting is not necessary. That being said, personal experience is just that and can vary from cook to cook. If you like to rest yours and you find that it makes it better then go for it. But in my experience I do not need to rest.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>A chiropractor broke my mom's ribs.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-05-14 22:04:15</DATE>
    <TEXT>So as the title states a chiropractor broke my mom's ribs. Right after it happened he told my mom he would pay for whatever medical costs that would come from this. So she goes to the doctor and gets the standard broken ribs treatment - x-rays, pain medication, etc. The doctor told her she could not go to work (it's moderately physical) for a little while. She went back to the chiropractor with a folder with all of the expenses including lost wages. When the chiropractor sees this he said he only meant that he would pay for x-rays. My mom makes very little money. And now she is in great pain and has not received a pay check for two weeks. I feel like the obvious answer here is to lawyer up. Here's the problem...my mom doesn't want to. She's a nice lady and does not want to damage the chiropractor's career (he's a young guy). Is there anything that could be done without an attorney? Location: Kansas USA.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks bud. This has been the most valuable of all of the responses. As you suggested it was a spinal manipulation. And she also previously broke her ribs a few years ago after a heart attack. My mom said that when he made the adjustment there was a very loud pop (and intense pain for her). After hearing the pop the chiropractor celebrated because he thought the sound was from the spinal adjustment - that he had never heard anything like that before. But...it turned out to be her ribs.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This comment is a little disingenuous. He was our starter for all of the 15/16 season. He was hurt down the stretch and could not start in the playoffs. Zatkoff and then Murray started - Murray got hot and when Fleury was back he did back him up. But as we all know you go with the hot hand. You're right about 16/17. He did back up Murray for most of the season. But to say that he was the back up for two seasons is factually incorrect.</TEXT>

He has this extremely fit dude who is out of his mind coming at him saying he's going to kill him. His tazer failed (though that may have been his fault). At that point what would you do? Again...I'm not a fan of cops at all. Not one bit. Fuck em. But I like what I'm seeing here. And after backup finally arrives a superior asks the guy to holster his weapon. And then that same superior instructs everyone else to pull out their tazers. It really sucks that this man's life was taken away. But it was whatever drugs - not the cops - who took that life on this day.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey folks, I've become a huge fan of smoking salmon - and I've gotten pretty good at it. Because of that I would like to branch out to other fish. I picked up a huge piece of Ahi for tomorrow and I'm wondering if I just follow the same directions for it. Typically with salmon I will dry brine with salt, brown sugar and some other seasonings over night. The next day I let it dry for 1-2 hours to get the pellicle. And then I just smoke with some fruitwood super low. Do I do the same with ahi?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I understand that. And there are a lot of Russian players with limited NHL success in their. But I think they're all Russian Army players with mountains of international success. I could be wrong. But I did just look back and in the last 10 years all of those guys inducted were Russian Army players. Kovi is amazing. But we all know that the HOF gives individual awards in the NHL a lot of attention. Kovi does not have those, nor does he have the international pedigree of his Russian predecessors.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; I don't get how--as a teammate--you could witness DSP on the receiving end of racism last season (more realistically: his whole career) and then turn to him and say, "it would be an honor for our team to visit with and shake the hand of the most powerful racist in the land. But we totally have your back about that whole racism thing." That's such a wonderful way to think on your part. Don't just talk about it...BE about it. Edit: And I agree with you. I also did not like The Penguins going. And bear with me as I might go off on the deep here, but to me it speaks to the different kind of lives that most hockey players lived growing up versus those in the NFL and NBA. And I hate to speak in cliches but it shows how privilege might disconnect people from reality.</TEXT>

My pitbull is as sweet as can be - but I know that he is an animal at heart and that I cannot 100% trust him to not snap at something he doesn't like.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes and no. My dog absolutely has the potential for some pretty serious things. But you're incorrect in thinking that the decision to rescue a pitbull was as casual as you imply. I got this dog with my fiance. She works as both a dog trainer and at an animal shelter. She met our boy at her shelter. He came in and was instantly the sweetest, most well-behaved dog at the place. But because he was a pittie nobody wanted him. He was there for about six months. During that time she just fell for him. We went through all of the proper procedure with the adoption. Preliminary meetings with me. Followed by about 10 different preliminary meetings with our other dog that was supervised by a dog behaviorist. My fiance and I were happy to see that our boy got along great with our other dog. First they were simply allowed to just meet each other. Then on other meetings they were walked together. Then we let them play in other meetings. The dog behaviorist signed off. So the dog came home with us. This was five years ago and we have had no issues with him. However, as I said, we both know that our dog is extremely powerful. And we also know that we cannot trust that our dog will never "snap". Our pittie has our love. But even with his sweetness and good behavior he does not have our trust. We keep keen eye on him. When we throw parties at our house we do not allow children or other dogs (even though he's great with other dogs). We never let him wander out of our eyesight. We keep him on a very tight leash - proverbially speaking.</TEXT>
