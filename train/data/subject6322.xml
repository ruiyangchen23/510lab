    <TEXT>Once Bitcoin splits, they will both have partial value. Meaning Bitcoin will be worth 80% of it's old value, and BTC cash around 20% for example. However in reality, the value of both coins will be less that the value of 1 BTC before the split. No such thing as free money.

    <TEXT>So it appears that during the weekends, since there are no news, coins tends to drfit towards their support levels. Given this, how many people usually sell off all their coins at a high point sometime on Thursday or Friday, to rebuy at a much cheaper rate on Sunday night? Does this even work?</TEXT>

Buy after the dump/retrace, sell before token release on 16th as it will likey lead to a dump, warranted or not. Buy as China communist party Congress begins on 18 October in anticipation of positive regulation news. Be ready to sell if no announcement comes, or news is not good for neo. Sell all neo by 25 October into BTC for free btc gold. Sell well before that if BTC is rising faster than neo. Go back all in to neo if China news is positive on the 26th. Unknowns - South Korea's Coinlink exchange listing can happen anytime after 9 October when Korea gets back to work. What do you think?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>NEO is not China's (PBoC) official blockchain, but it's okay. Here's why.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-10-14 15:55:36</DATE>
    <TEXT>PBoC will be announcing it's own blockchain shortly and it will not be NEO. -It will be used for government tasks, from records keeping IDs to maintaining health records and whatever other centralized government functions they can think of. - #8206;it will not be traded on bittrex, binance, or any other exchanges we are familiar with. - #8206;there will definitely not be any ICOs on this blockchain. So really, this blockchain has nothing to do with us crypto traders. And it's also interesting to note that Da Hongfei advised PBoC in it's development. So what does this mean? When we talk about "China's crypto" we really mean "Chinese regulation compliant". Case in point, weChat is not the China's official chat program. Baidu is not China's official search program. They are merely regulation compliant programs that rose to the top of their respective fields and eventually became synonymous with China. Neo team had made it clear time and time again that they are fully compliant and have no problem with regulations. However, the crypto field is at its infancy and it's too early for a blockchain to become synonymous with China. That said, neo has the first mover advantage and had already been labeled, albeit by the West, as "China's ethereum". Neo will undoubtedly lead Chinese crypto when China reopens it's exchanges under it's regulations. Bottom line, don't dump your Neo because your friend promised you it will be announced as China's official crypto at the 19th communist party Congress; it won't. My reason for writing this is to educate so people don't FUD and dump neo when it's not named as China's official crypto. But it will soar nevertheless as the Chinese cryptocurrencies are just getting started. Don't sell to regret a year from now. spread the word.!</TEXT>

Maybe he left to pursue grander visions? Full disclosure, I'm 95% ICX but will be selling a big chunk to ETH to buy YGG ICO.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>33K needs to hold in the near term as we continue to go down to 25K full retrace. Before 25k gets to us, market sentiment needs to turn bullish or news needs to come out. For longer term, I have no doubt we will hit an ATH in April, like in the $15-20 range, before BTC starts surging. I plan to sell and buy back after the next BTC crash. ICX will most likely hit $50 ATH at some point in 2018...whether it stay up there is up to BTC. If you do not take profit at these milestone highs, you would be a fool as there will always be a retrace.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Upbit listed ICON but not Bittrex. It is my understanding Upbit shares orderbook with Bittrex. Does this mean Bittrex listing is in the near future and only delayed by cumbersome US regulations? Bittrex is a ghost town now, but still worth a 5-10K sat pump I think. And hopefully Bitfinex listing won't be too far behind. These listings combined with mobile wallet release and token swap news should be enough to push ICON to 50K+ sats if we catch BTC bounce at 7500-7600 and bull trap to 9500 coming in the next several days. If none of these good things happen and BTC goes to 6K range, RIP everyone's portfolios.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'll make a price prediction. With majority of Elliot Wave chartists predicting BTC will hit temporary bottom of 7200 as March ends, ICON will likely hit somewhere between 30-33K. Let's pray 30K holds. Just as BTC bounces (and ICON and all other alts with it), Min releases the mobile wallet and announces token swap instructions. The whole team traveling around Asia tells me the wallet is already finished. Most EW chartists expected ICX to dip to 30-35K then up to 50-60K range before the next retrace. Hopefully we will at least pump to 40K, and as steam begins to run out, either Bittrex or Bitfinex will list Icon and give the pump one more push (Upbit, which is Bittrex's partner and shares order book with Bittrex already listed ICX...no idea why Bittrex hasn't). OKcoin Korea also said it would open in March, meaning they only have a few days left as well. Sure it's an entire exchange and won't really benefit just ICX, but who knows, maybe they will have some sort of ICX related contest since it's a Korean coin? one can only wish. Of course these are just random musings of an ICX holder in dire times, but I think we need some optimism with all the FUD around. Who knows, maybe the Koreans will come around and rally around their national coin when they realize BTC is dumping hard and taking everything down with it and realize EOS XRP and STORM are not the answer... Let's go ICON!!!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>the sad reality is that Korea is not buying. Bithumb/Upbit ICX trading volume has been decreasing steadily and Bithumb ICX price is lower than Binance. Usually, Koreans pay MORE, but ICX is cheaper in Korea. Gotta change this.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's not in any trouble. 1 satoshi is too large of a unit for holo trading. You are either paying too little or too much. Trade at Hotbit where they added 2 more decimal points to BTC paring or trade in HOT/ETH pair. And you try to buying at 8 sats right now and waiting for your order to get filled after 3 billion orders ahead of yours. Stop being so naive. People getting their 8 sat buy orders fillied right now have been waiting days to get those filled if not a week. People paying the asking price don't care about the 1 sat difference as they know it's going to be easily 200 - 1000 sats next bull market.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>let's revisit this next bullmarket when crypto market cap approaches 1 trillion USD. So you don't think Holo can even double it's market cap to 160 million when the total crypto market cap is 1 trillion. You are the clueless idiot assuming that I am a clueless binance trader. Do you even know how shitcoins pump when altseason hits? You are the same idiot who said ripple cannot break 25 cents (it went to almost $3), ADA cannot go over 600 sats (it went to 8000sats) and xvg could not go over 100sats (it went to 1800). Stay poor, you the guy who doesn't understand the market cycle.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So if I bought at 6 SATs and the price is now 8 SATs, someone is always dumping at 11% lower than me? You're some kind of special. Lol. I think what you mean to say is that there is about 11% difference between the bidding and asking price due to hot price changes are too small to be quantified correctly with one sat but you are just too dumb to understand it. Also checked your previous posts and you are a complete troll.</TEXT>
