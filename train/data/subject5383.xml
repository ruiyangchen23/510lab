    <TEXT>Not exactly. There were these two so-called [Opium wars in China involving the British](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opium_Wars)  gt; The Chinese briefly sought to stop Britain from illegally importing and selling opium in the country, while Britain sought to legalize its opium trade and to liberalize other trade. For Britain, its balance of trade would be more favourable if Chinese payments for smuggled opium, provided from India and Turkey by British and other merchants, were boosted.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Forgot about that. Just got this excerpt from Wikipedia where he was shot during a drug bust:  gt; Shooting and public interest  gt; Serpico was shot during a drug arrest attempt on February 3, 1971, at 778 Driggs Avenue, in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Four officers from Brooklyn North received a tip that a drug deal was about to take place. Two policemen, Gary Roteman and Arthur Cesare, stayed outside, while the third, Paul Halley, stood in front of the apartment building. Serpico climbed up the fire escape, entered by the fire escape door, went downstairs, listened for the password, then followed two suspects outside.[7]  gt; The police arrested the young suspects, and found one had two bags of heroin. Halley stayed with the suspects, and Roteman told Serpico (who spoke Spanish), to make a fake purchase attempt to get the drug dealers to open the door. The police went to the third-floor landing. Serpico knocked on the door, keeping his hand on his revolver. The door opened a few inches, just far enough to wedge his body in. Serpico called for help, but his fellow officers ignored him.[7]  gt; Serpico was then shot in the face with a .22 LR pistol. The bullet struck just below the eye and lodged at the top of his jaw. He fired back,[8] fell to the floor, and began to bleed profusely. His police colleagues refused to make a "10-13" dispatch to police headquarters indicating that an officer had been shot. An elderly man who lived in the next apartment called the emergency services and reported that a man had been shot. The stranger stayed with Serpico.[7] A police car arrived. Unaware that Serpico was one of them, the officers took him to Greenpoint Hospital.[citation needed] Good film too starring Al Pacino.</TEXT>

Personally witness such a reaction last week at a meeting.  gt; An amygdala hijack exhibits three signs: strong emotional reaction, sudden onset, and post-episode realization if the reaction was inappropriate. What if a person is still angry post-episode and still think their rage reaction is justified when everyone think they overreacted?

    <TEXT>I am no expert but I read somewhere that it helps if you take a few deep breaths - slowly and gently (not hyperventilate) to contain your initial impulse to overreact. This might give you time to figure if your next action is going to be counterproductive and calm the fuck down! Maybe even excuse myself and leave the room if possible. Avoid making it worse for yourself - it's your emotional side taking control.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I may be wrong since I am no expert or even remotely close to the field of psychology/neurology etc. From the highest OP's comment I think this amygdala hijack is almost instantaneous - the amygdala takes over in milliseconds and the rational part of the brain has no chance to even "think about it". From thence on if the experience has been mapped the emotional side of the brain is triggered and the noecortex is not prominently active. I guess in your case it's a collection of bad experiences that allowed you to form some opinion of the unfairness of the professors' actions and the basis for your judgement of them. I don't think this is rage - which is almost instantaneous - like this guy [here]( http://i.imgur.com/bHeXIB5.gifv) - from r/wtf That doesn't mean your are not being unfairly treated. But as I said I am no expert and I bow to those with superior knowledge ;)</TEXT>

Ops article:  gt; "The Iraqi authorities call on Turkey to ... immediately withdraw from Iraqi territory, #8221; the statement said.  gt;  #8220;We have confirmation that Turkish forces, numbering about one armoured regiment with a number of tanks and artillery, entered Iraqi territory ... allegedly to train Iraqi groups, without a request or authorisation from Iraqi federal authorities, #8221;  gt; The deployment  #8220;is considered a serious violation of Iraqi sovereignty #8221;, it added. It's not Turkey's business so why is Erdogan interfering?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not trying to discredit you. I am not an authority on such matters so I have to resort to a Google search and this WHO report is interesting especially this part:  gt; The organ-exporting countries  gt; India was a commonly known organ-exporting country, where organs from local donors are regularly transplanted to foreigners through sale and purchase. Although the number of foreign recipients seems to have decreased after the enactment of a law banning the organ trade (the Human Organ Transplantation Act of 1994),10 the underground organ market is still existent and resurging in India. The Voluntary Health Association of India estimates that about 2000 Indians sell a kidney every year.11 The drop in foreign recipients in India was accompanied by an increase in the number of foreign recipients in other countries, such as Pakistan and the Philippines.  gt; In Pakistan, according to the Sindhi Institute of Urology, approximately 2000 renal transplants were performed in 2005, of which up to two-thirds were estimated to have been performed on foreigners.12 In the Philippines, data obtained from the Renal Disease Control Program of the Department of Health, National Kidney Transplant Institute, show that of the 468 kidney transplants in 2003, 110 were for patients from abroad. There is no comparable data for Egypt but a considerable number of patients from neighbouring countries are believed to undergo organ transplantation there.13  gt; In China, around 12 000 kidney and liver transplants were performed in 2005. Most of the transplant organs were alleged to have been procured from executed prisoners, a practice which itself is criticized by the international community.14,15 In the absence of paid organ donors, a question may be raised regarding whether the deceased organ transplants in China constitute an organ trade. Yet the lack of established rules about the allocation of organs, coupled with the prioritizing of foreigners due to their ability to pay and the existence of brokers, have been widely reported. These factors have led to the view that deceased organ transplants for foreigners in China do constitute part of the international organ trade. The number of foreign recipients in China is difficult to estimate, but a media report offers circumstantial evidence that over half of the 900 kidney and liver transplants performed in one major transplant centre in 2004 were for non-Chinese citizens from 19 countries.16  gt; The lack or insufficiency of a legal framework or enforcing mechanism in these countries has been highlighted by the public media and local experts. However, the Chinese and Pakistani governments recently have been taking steps to curtail the international organ trade (as of May 2007), which may change their respective situations.17,18</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Another interesting controversy in the De Anza case concerning Judge Persky:  gt; Four of the baseball players invoked fifth amendment rights not to self-incriminate during the discovery phase of the litigation.......  gt; The original judge in the case ruled in 2010 that the defendants could stay silent, but that would also mean that they would be prohibited from testifying in a later part of the case.  gt; That ruling was, however, overturned by Persky, a move that Jane Doe #8217;s attorneys now say undermined her case.  gt; Persky, taking over the trail in 2011, allowed one of the defendants, Christopher Knopf, to enter evidence that the woman #8217;s lawyers believed should have been covered by the earlier judge #8217;s order.  gt;  #8220;It was shocking to see judge Persky disregard that order, #8221; Burneikis said.  #8220;One judge completely disregarding an order that another judge has entered: yes, that was unusual. #8221;  gt;  #8220;It was devastating, #8221; she continued.  #8220;I can remember how I felt the moment the ruling came down and it was like a nail in a coffin.

    <TEXT>OP is probably referring to [this](http://www.newsweek.com/marijuana-and-old-amsterdam-308218)  gt; Cannabis with more than 15 percent of the THC that makes it intoxicating is now under consideration to be reclassified as one of the  #8220;hard drugs #8221; that come with stiff penalties. The government has also forced coffee shops where marijuana is sold to choose between alcohol and pot, prompting many to choose the former. Amsterdam once played host to nearly 300 coffee shops, of more than 1,000 scattered across the country. There are now fewer than 200 in the city and only 617 nationwide. While it #8217;s always been illegal to grow marijuana in the Netherlands, authorities passively allow coffee shops to sell weed, often pretending not to know where the shops #8217; cannabis comes from.  gt; But no longer. New laws target even the smallest of marijuana growers in Holland. In the past, people could grow up to five plants without fear of retribution. In 2011, the government issued new police guidelines and declared anyone who grew with electric lights, prepared soil,  #8220;selected #8221; seeds or ventilation would be considered  #8220;professional. #8221; It #8217;s a significant change, as professional growers risk major penalties, including eviction and blacklisting from the government-provided housing in which more than half of the country #8217;s citizens reside.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; Another senior official has directly blamed the United States.  gt; The Obama administration has strongly denied any involvement or responsibility in recent events in the country. In a phone call to his counterpart in Turkey, US Secretary of State John Kerry said:  #8220;Public insinuations or claims about any role by the United States in the failed coup attempt are utterly false and harmful to our bilateral relations." None of these allegations by Erodogan's govt has any basis other than his so-called political "enemy" residing in the US. Erdogan is either playing a well thought out strategic game or he is simply lashing out in anger. From threatening the German parliament over the recent recognising the Armenian genocide to now insinuating that the Obama administration is directly involved in the recent attempted coup, he is rapidly losing allies. Erdogan is either a raving lunatic or simply a brilliant strategist. But it's hard to credit him as the latter seeing that he reckons Mulism woman should have three children and alienated himself from those women voters. That hardly seems like a clever move for a politician. How critical is Incirlik Airbase to US and NATO operations or are there alternatives for USAF in neighbouring countries? It's risky to station US forces in a country and then to have to rely on a whims and fancies of a nutjob who can turn on sixpence.

    <TEXT>Copy of the article: By DENISE ROLAND Oct. 30, 2016 1:42 p.m. ET 68 COMMENTS Kendall Jack was dismayed when her health plan stopped covering her migraine drug Treximet earlier this year. To buy a pack at the pharmacy would cost $750, compared with a $20 copay when the drug was covered.  #8220;Nothing #8217;s worth $750 for nine pills, #8221; she said.  #8220;It #8217;s cruel. #8221; Instead, the 50-year-old stay-at-home mother from Memphis, Tenn., takes Treximet #8217;s two active ingredients #8212;sumatriptan and naproxen #8212;as separate pills. For these two generic drugs, her copay is zero. A spokesman for Pernix Therapeutics Holdings Inc., which sells Treximet, said the drug addressed an unmet need among migraine sufferers by combining sumatriptan and naproxen into a single tablet. He also said Mrs. Jack could get a pack of Treximet for $20 by contacting the company directly. Treximet is just one of many drugs whose active ingredients are generic drugs that can be purchased separately at a fraction of the cost. Others include acne cream Acanya, Duexis for rheumatoid pain and weight-loss pill Qsymia, according to data compiled for The Wall Street Journal by GoodRx, a group that compares pharmacy prices for prescription drugs. A spokesman for Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc., which makes Acanya, said doctors could prescribe whichever medication they believe is most appropriate for their patients. Valeant is one drugmaker that has come under fire amid a broader eruption of public anger at drug companies for sharp price increases in recent years. A spokesman for Horizon Pharma PLC, maker of Duexis, said combining its constituents made it easier for patients to stick with their drug regimen. Mark Oki, chief financial officer of Vivus Inc., which makes Qsymia, declined to comment. For Treximet, a box of nine tablets costs $728.67, according to Truven Health Analytics. Insurers and employers typically pay less than this so-called list price as a result of behind-the-scenes discounts: the average actual cost for a box of Treximet is about $353, according to an analysis of company-reported sales and prescription data from IMS, a health-care data company. To buy its two constituents, sumatriptan and naproxen, would cost around $19, according to GoodRx. ENLARGE There is no evidence that Treximet tackles migraines any better than a two-pill regimen of sumatriptan plus naproxen. The two clinical trials that led to its approval pitted it against sumatriptan alone, naproxen alone and placebo. Those trials were jointly conducted by GlaxoSmithKline PLC and Pozen Inc., now called Aralez Pharmaceuticals PLC. Glaxo transferred the rights for Treximet to Pernix in 2014. Some patients avoid paying the full price for Treximet because the cost is partly covered by their health plans. But those whose plans don #8217;t cover Treximet face the pharmacy price, which often exceeds the list price. Pernix and others said they issued coupons to keep patient copays low in some cases. Even so, patients likely will end up paying for it indirectly.  #8220;Premiums go up, or it #8217;s passed on to employers, #8221; said Michael Rea, chief executive of Rx Savings Solutions, a software company that helps employers and health plans lower their prescription costs by pointing patients to cheaper alternatives.  #8220;It all comes out of the same bucket. #8221; In some cases, combining two or more drugs into a single pill has benefits, such as added convenience, said Bernstein analyst Ronny Gal. The problem: There is no agreed-upon process for assigning a fair value to those benefits.  #8220;This is one more example of the inefficiency of the U.S. health-care system, #8221; he said. Mrs. Jack is a case in point: She would be willing to pay a premium price for Treximet, which she finds more effective than two separate pills, but not $750 more. What #8217;s more, patients and their doctors often have no idea that a cheaper alternative exists.  #8220;Americans shop [around] for everything in their lives, except medications, #8221; said Mr. Rea of Rx Savings Solutions.  #8220;They don #8217;t know how. #8221;  #8220;Understanding the price of medication with the myriad of health plans offered in the U.S. is extremely complicated, #8221; said Anand Rajani, a pediatrician based in Fresno, Calif., who owns a small stake in closely held Rx Savings Solutions.  #8220;Physicians are totally unaware #8221; of the price. To complicate matters further, some combination drugs use slightly different doses than are easily available to buy separately in the pharmacy. A single pill of Treximet contains 85 milligrams of sumatriptan and 500 milligrams of naproxen. When sold separately, sumatriptan comes in pills of 50 milligrams or 100 milligrams, making direct substitution difficult. Sharon Orrange, an internal-medicine doctor at Keck Medical Center of the University of Southern California, said she had switched many patients to generics from branded drugs which, like Treximet, comprise two generic constituents. She also works as a consultant for GoodRx on which branded combination drugs can be substituted with cheaper generics. For many of these patients, the savings are substantial, she said:  #8220;I have patients who can use the money [saved] to join a gym, or take a trip they couldn #8217;t take before. #8221;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Just read this comment from "The Guardian (live)" a couple of mins ago.  gt; The big picture right now  gt; Where do things stand, big-picture wise?  gt; Trump #8217;s having a good night. But results in the key battleground state are still out. Pointing to bright points for Trump, we look to Florida, where he is beating previous performances by Republican candidates in many rural counties and in the Tampa and St Petersburg area, which is a lot of people. We look to Virginia, where the race has yet to be called for Clinton, despite strong returns for her in the populous northern counties. And we look to question marks in the upper Midwest, in Wisconsin and Michigan, states that have not gone for a Republican in a presidential election in the last six elections, but where a lot of support for Trump among white, blue-collar voters could tilt the dynamics of the races this year.  gt; Clinton has bright points to point to as well, including that strong performance in Virginia #8217;s northern counties, the fact that portions of Florida yet to count are thought to prefer her strongly, and her solid early voting results in Nevada and elsewhere. She has strong precedent to rely on for possible victory in those aforementioned upper Midwestern states, which help make up her so-called  #8220;blue firewall #8221; of states  #8211; none of which she has yet lost.  gt; It #8217;s still either candidate #8217;s race. And we #8217;re coming up on a new wave of poll closings in states including Nevada, which has a habit of announcing results quickly, and Utah, where the presence of third-party candidate Evan McMullin, and perceived soft support for Trump could be important to the ultimate result.  gt; We have a ways to go.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; Close to 9,000 people have died since Duterte took office and promised an unrelenting campaign to rid the Philippines of illegal narcotics. About a third were killed in anti-drug operations in which officers said the victims had violently resisted arrest.  gt; Many other deaths were blamed on mysterious vigilantes who killed dealers and users, or homicides that could be unrelated to drugs. Police deny any involvement in those killings, most of which they say remain under investigation. Smart move by jailed critic Senator Leila de Lim. Bring public attention to herself just in case Duterte and his henchmen decide to make her one of the statistics of mysterious vigilantes death.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>ARTICLE (behind paywall):  gt; A trade row with Boeing could result in the US aerospace company  #8220;turning off #8221; Britain #8217;s attack helicopters, military transport aircraft and a planned fleet of submarine-detecting planes, sources said last night.  gt; The Ministry of Defence is buying 50 Apache AH-64E helicopters and nine P-8 maritime patrol aircraft from the US government. It already operates a fleet of C-17 transport aircraft and 60 Chinook helicopters. All the aircraft are built by Boeing.  gt; Part of the multibillion-pound deal is for the US manufacturer to provide upgrades and support for the technology on the aircraft, meaning that any breakdown in relations between Britain and Boeing could affect their serviceability.  #8220;Boeing owns the data. You buy the data. You rely on the original equipment manufacturer for the key to the data, servicing and upgrades, #8221; a former four-star officer said.  #8220;If you piss Boeing off, what are you going to do? They can turn the fleet off. #8221;  gt; Industry and defence sources described as  #8220;pretty hollow #8221; a warning by Sir Michael Fallon, the defence secretary, of retaliatory action against Boeing unless the company defuses a dispute with Bombardier, a Canadian company that employs thousands of people in Belfast. The US Department of Commerce has recommended a 220 per cent tariff on Bombardier aircraft after a complaint by Boeing.  gt; They also noted that a tit-for-tat row between Britain and Boeing could throw into jeopardy a proposal by the US firm to build a new aircraft centre at Boscombe Down, an MoD site in Wiltshire, a move that would generate more jobs. Boeing says it wants to double its 2,200-strong UK workforce by 2025. It is already building facilities in Sheffield, Gatwick and Lossiemouth.  gt; This reliance on Boeing for military equipment exposes Britain #8217;s weakness in a trade row, industry sources say. The MoD has been forced to buy more defence equipment from the US rather than from British industry in recent years to benefit from economies of scale and because there is less development risk.  gt; It provides less value for the British economy, however, because less money is invested in British jobs and into British business, according to industry sources. One said:  #8220;A number of defence companies are dusting down plans for alternative equipment supplies.  gt;  #8220;Boeing are simply not to be trusted and they deserve everything that is coming to them. You know what, the big guns of business are swivelling their barrels towards them. #8221;  gt; A source close to Boeing said:  #8220;Boeing provides the best products, services and people to meet the needs of the customer. Is this sour grapes from less successful bidders who can #8217;t win on a level playing field either? #8221;  gt; Boeing said it spent  #163;2.1 billion with more than 250 suppliers in Britain last year, three times the level of 2011. This supports 16,500 jobs in the supply chain on top of the 2,200 people directly employed by Boeing in the UK. Edit: For clarity</TEXT>

Yet, pollution is the largest environmental cause of disease and death in the world today, responsible for an estimated 9 million premature deaths.

Through analyses of existing and emerging data, the Commission reveals pollution #8217;s severe and underreported contribution to the Global Burden of Disease. It uncovers the economic costs of pollution to low-income and middle-income countries.

    <TEXT> gt; Nothing to see here FTA this snippet of info is interesting:  gt; The Chao family #8217;s use of offshore structures came to light in 2014 when The Nation reported that the family business had routed ownership of its cargo ships through a series of opaque registrations in Liberia and the Marshall Islands. And The Nation article linked below: [Mitch McConnell #8217;s Freighted Ties to a Shadowy Shipping Company: After drugs were found aboard the Ping May, a vessel owned by his wife #8217;s family #8217;s company, Colombian authorities are investigating.](https://www.thenation.com/article/mitch-mcconnells-freighted-ties-shadowy-shipping-company/):  gt; Though Foremost has played a pivotal role in McConnell #8217;s life, bestowing the senator with most of his personal wealth and generating thousands in donations to his campaign committees, the drug bust went unnoticed in Kentucky, where every bit of McConnell-related news has generated fodder for the campaign trail. That #8217;s because, like many international shipping companies, Chao #8217;s firm is shrouded from public view, concealing its identity and limiting its legal liability through an array of tax shelters and foreign registrations. Registered through a limited liability company in the Marshall Islands, the Ping May flies the Liberian flag.</TEXT>

How would this change China #8217;s foreign polices overal and in particular with the US now that Xi can focus on long term issues over a 10-20 years ahead. Knowing this how do you think Trump will manuever himself in order to cope Xi #8217;s rising influence on the world stage? Thank you in advance.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>[Human activities might influence oncogenic processes in wild animal populations](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-018-0558-7) Abstract Based on the abundant studies available on humans showing clear associations between rapid environmental changes and the rate of neoplasia, we propose that human activities might increase cancer rate in wild populations through numerous processes. Most of the research on this topic has concentrated on wildlife cancer prevalence in environments that are heavily contaminated with anthropogenic chemicals. Here, we propose that human activities might also increase cancer rate in wild populations through additional processes including light pollution, accidental (for example, human waste) or intentional (for example, bird feeders) wildlife feeding (and the associated change of diet), or reduction of genetic diversity in human-impacted habitats. The human species can thus be defined as an oncogenic species, moderating the environment in the way that it causes cancer in other wild populations. As human impacts on wildlife are predicted to increase rather than decrease (for example, in the context of urbanization), acknowledging the possible links between human activity and cancer in wild populations is crucial.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Extremely rapid maturation of a wild African annual fish Milan Vrt #237;lek, Jakub,  #381; #225;k, Martin P #353;eni #269;ka, Martin Reichard DOI:https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2018.06.031 Summary Ephemeral habitats can impose challenging conditions for population persistence. Survival strategies in these environments can range from high dispersal capacity to the evolution of dormant stages able to tolerate a harsh environment outside the temporal window of favourable conditions [1]. Annual killifish have evolved to live in seasonal pools on the African savannah and display a range of adaptations to cope with an unpredictable environment [2, 3]. For most of the year, killifish populations survive as diapausing embryos buried in dry sediment. When savannah depressions fill with rainwater, the fish hatch, grow rapidly and, after attaining sexual maturity, reproduce daily [2, 4]. Nothobranchius furzeri, a model species in ageing research [2, 3], is distributed in a region where the climate is particularly dry and rains are unpredictable [5]. Here, we demonstrate that the fast juvenile growth and rapid sexual maturation shown by N. furzeri in captivity is actually an underestimate of their natural developmental rate. We estimated the age of N. furzeri in natural populations by counting daily-deposited increments in the otoliths and performing histological analysis of gonads. We found that N. furzeri are capable of reaching sexual maturity within 14 days after hatching, which to our knowledge is the fastest rate of sexual maturation recorded for a vertebrate. We also demonstrate that N. furzeri can grow from an initial length of 5 mm up to 54 mm over the course of a two-week period. Such rapid juvenile development is likely to be adaptive since some pools were entirely desiccated 3 #8211;5 weeks after filling, but retained a viable killifish population that reproduced before the adults succumbed to the disappearance of their pool.</TEXT>

Sutherland2 and Didier Queloz1 Science Advances 01 Aug 2018: Vol. 4, no. 8, eaar3302 DOI: 10.1126/sciadv.aar3302 Abstract Given that the macromolecular building blocks of life were likely produced photochemically in the presence of ultraviolet (UV) light, we identify some general constraints on which stars produce sufficient UV for this photochemistry. We estimate how much light is needed for the UV photochemistry by experimentally measuring the rate constant for the UV chemistry ( #8220;light chemistry #8221;, needed for prebiotic synthesis) versus the rate constants for the bimolecular reactions that happen in the absence of the UV light ( #8220;dark chemistry #8221;). We make these measurements for representative photochemical reactions involving Embedded Image and HS #8722;. By balancing the rates for the light and dark chemistry, we delineate the  #8220;abiogenesis zones #8221; around stars of different stellar types based on whether their UV fluxes are sufficient for building up this macromolecular prebiotic inventory. We find that the Embedded Image light chemistry is rapid enough to build up the prebiotic inventory for stars hotter than K5 (4400 K). We show how the abiogenesis zone overlaps with the liquid water habitable zone. Stars cooler than K5 may also drive the formation of these building blocks if they are very active. The HS #8722; light chemistry is too slow to work even for early Earth.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Small room for compromise between oil palm cultivation and primate conservation in Africa Giovanni Strona, Simon D. Stringer, Ghislain Vieilledent, Zoltan Szantoi, John Garcia-Ulloa, and Serge A. Wich PNAS August 13, 2018. 201804775; published ahead of print August 13, 2018. https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1804775115 Significance Although oil palm cultivation represents an important source of income for many tropical countries, its future expansion is a primary threat to tropical forests and biodiversity. In this context, and especially in regions where industrial palm oil production is still emerging, identifying  #8220;areas of compromise, #8221; that is, areas with high productivity and low biodiversity importance, could be a unique opportunity to reconcile conservation and economic growth. We applied this approach to Africa, by combining data on oil palm suitability with primate distribution, diversity, and vulnerability. We found that such areas of compromise are very rare throughout the continent (0.13 Mha), and that large-scale expansion of oil palm cultivation in Africa will have unavoidable, negative effects on primates.</TEXT>
