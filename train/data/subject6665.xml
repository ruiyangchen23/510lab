    <DATE>2014-07-24 19:55:05</DATE>
    <TEXT>You may have noticed that /r/politics has had a bit of a makeover to make our rules clearer and more accessible. These are the changes: * **A new sidebar:** We have rewritten our rules in the sidebar to make them as clear and simple as possible. Mousing over a rule will provide further details. There are links within each of the expanded text areas to [our wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/wiki/rulesandregs) which gives an even more in depth explanation of the rule. The expanded text will automatically close after you move your mouse away from the area. * **Wiki update:** Our full rules which are located in the /r/politics [wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/wiki/rulesandregs) have also seen an update. The focus in this update was to improve the layout and reorganize the wiki to make it easier to navigate. The rules within are the same, but have had minor adjustments for clarity. * **New comment box text:** A cute snoo has been added to the comment box to remind you of our civility rule when commenting. There are several important rules to keep in mind when commenting and you can view them in our spiffy new sidebar. We find the "Be Civil" rule to be the one that is most commonly violated and we hope that the new comment box will serve as a reminder to treat others with respect in conversations, even if you disagree with them. * **New downvote text:** We have shortened the text for the downvote button in the hopes that more users will use the downvote button correctly. The new text reads "Vote based on quality, not opinion." __________ This is also an opportunity for us to remind ourselves of [Reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette), which asks that we vote based on quality and not opinion. Political discussion requires multiple viewpoints and we do not want to ostracize those of different beliefs and opinions from our community. Rather, we encourage people of all views to participate in discussions. Well-written and interesting content can be worthwhile, even if you disagree with it. We ask that you follow [Reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) and only downvote if you think a comment/post does not contribute to the thread it is posted in or if it is off-topic in /r/politics. Please vote based on quality and not opinion, and please vote regularly. _____________ We recommend taking the time to read each of the rules in the sidebar and for the more enthusiastic users, you can read [our full rules here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/wiki/index) Feel free to give us feedback below! _______ _________ **TL;DR** There is a new sidebar, new comment box text, new downvote text, and [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/Politics_Test/comments/2beiqr/draft_sticky/) has been reorganized. Mouse over the rules in the sidebar to see expanded details on each rule. And remember [Reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) - vote based on quality and not opinion.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>A Quick Quiz + Prizes</TITLE>
    <DATE>2014-08-18 17:25:34</DATE>
    <TEXT>Over the past several weeks, there has been a big focus on the rules of /r/politics and the rules of Reddit. So, the mods of /r/politics have decided that it is time for a little bit of fun after all those rules, rules, rules, but we also wanted to be able to reward those who paid attention. To that end, we have created a short quiz and those that score an 85% or higher will receive: * a 1 month temporary flair * be entered into a raffle for Reddit Gold. We have plenty of Reddit Gold prizes, so you have a good chance of winning should you choose to participate. You can only take the quiz once and the quiz is not timed. **Quiz has now ended. Thank you to all who participated.**</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Quiz Results</TITLE>
    <DATE>2014-08-26 08:10:08</DATE>
    <TEXT>The quiz has ended, but we had so much fun doing it. Nearly 1000 people participated and many of those people chose to give us feedback and suggestions. Thank you to everyone who participated in our quiz and to those who commented in the sticky thread. This sticky will be a bit lengthy and has been broken up into three parts: quiz answers, user feedback, winners of Reddit Gold and flair. _____ ______ **Part 1: Quiz Answers** ____ **Question 1:** Which of the below titles do you think best fits the /r/politics on topic statement? * [Responses.](http://i.imgur.com/kJS8zPz.png) * Correct answer: Congress approves additional funding for Israel. * Explanation: /r/politics is the subreddit for current and **explicitly political U.S. news** and information only. The only title in the selection available that deals explicitly with US politics is the one involving Congress. The options involving the UN and the ceasefire while important, do not explicitly discuss US politics, but rather are linked implicitly due to our relationship with Israel and our involvement in the Middle East. Those two options would be more appropriate in /r/worldnews. The celebrity one is completely off-topic for obvious reasons. **Question 2:** When is it okay to modify your submission title so that it is no longer the exact headline and/or exact quotes from the article? * [Responses.](http://i.imgur.com/xjkZwob.png) * Correct answer: Never. * Explanation: Titles must be the **exact** headline and/or **exact** quotes from the article. The selection of quotes should reflect the article as a whole. Prior to a rule requiring titles comprised of quotes, there were issues with users commenting in the title box instead of using the title field to describe the content of an article. The purpose of an article title is to explain the content of the article to users who may then want to read the article or not. All users should provide their thoughts on the topic in the comments. **Question 3:** You should use the "Suggest A Title" feature when submitting links and use whatever headline that feature generates for your post. * [Responses.](http://i.imgur.com/1mvNBvK.png) * Correct answer: False. * Explanation: The "suggest a title" feature uses the title tag in the html of the document and this title does not always match the title of the article. In fact, these url produced titles are often more sensational and editorialized than the title and quotes of an article because they are trying to get as many people to click and view the article as possible. Copying and pasting the exact title and/or exact quotes from an article will avoid the issues of the suggested title button entirely. Edit: Thanks to /u/hugogoetz for the correction. **Question 4:** If you are discussing an issue in /r/politics with other users and someone calls you a "fucking idiot", what should you do? * [Responses.](http://i.imgur.com/6Ye8RGR.png) * Correct answer: Ignore them and/or report the comment to the mods. * Explanation: Politics is a heated subject and many people are very passionate about their views on political topics. This can result in conversations quickly becoming volatile and even verge into uncivil discourse. Our rules regarding civility are in place to facilitate productive discourse. Therefore, if someone does insult you or personally attack you, the best thing you can do is to simply not engage with the user any further and report the comments that violate our rules. If you choose to respond and engage in an internet fight, you not only risk mod involvement in regards to your behavior, but you also reduce the chance that others will respect your argument and take you seriously. Remember, you are not just arguing with one user, you are also putting forth a view that other Redditors can see and consider. **Question 5:** Which of the following examples is NOT rehosted? * [Responses.](http://i.imgur.com/mYbUzNZ.png) * Correct answer: An article written by the journalist of the website it appears on. There are a few quotes, but everything is cited and there is plenty of original writing. * Explanation: Many people expressed their concerns and misunderstandings of this rule. First, the rule regarding rehosted content is part of [Reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) and one that /r/politics mods have chosen to enforce. We feel that this rule is particularly important for a few reasons: 1) Reddit generates a lot of traffic and we believe that the content creator should reap the benefits that come with increased traffic. 2) It helps to ensure less blogspam and better quality articles. * The explanation for question 8 goes into more detail. **Question 6:** What is the maximum age of an article that can be submitted to r/politics? * [Responses.](http://i.imgur.com/Lh0dXgD.png) * Correct answer: 45 days. * Explanation: Articles must be published within the last 45 days, or less if there are significant developments that lead older articles to be inaccurate or misleading. Older publications tend to leave out important details or consider current events from a perspective that may no longer be valid. If you believe that an older publication has a direct impact or has quality content relating to an important current issue, then you can post it in a self-post on our self-post Saturdays and bring it into the context of today. **Question 7:** Which of the following would NOT be appropriate as a valid submission to /r/politics? Check all that apply. * [Responses.](http://i.imgur.com/JXLMV8D.png) * Correct answers: * (1) A link to an active petition concerning a very important issue. * (2) A video clip from the Colbert Report making a very good political point. * (4) An indepth and informative wikipedia article. * (7) A meme about a current political issue. * (8) An on-point political cartoon from the New York Times. * Explanation: Submissions must be articles, videos, or soundclips. Therefore, out of the available answers, the following would be allowed in /r/politics - * (3) An article about an explicitly political topic that was published recently. * (5) A youtube video about an important political issue that was published recently. * (6) An audio clip from NPR's recent interview with a Senator. * Active polls and petitions, satire, wikis, memes, political cartoons, and social media (like Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr) are not valid submissions to /r/politics and will be removed. **Question 8:** All submissions must be from the original source. This means that they should contain significant analysis and original content--not just a few links of text among chunks of copy and pasted material. * [Responses.](http://i.imgur.com/2L84kqL.png) * Correct answer: True. * Explanation: This goes back to our rules regarding rehosted content. The question is taken word for word from our sidebar. The key here is that content must contain **significant analysis and original content**. This means that articles are perfectly acceptable if they are quoting other publications, public figures, embedding a youtube video, etc as long as the article also contains significant analysis and original content. **Question 9:** Reddiquette is an informal expression of the values of many redditors, as written by redditors themselves. These rules should be followed: * [Responses.](http://i.imgur.com/uMwAfaL.png) * Correct answer: Everywhere on Reddit. * Explanation: Reddiquette are site-wide expectations of behavior. You can read more about [Reddiquette here.](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) **Question 10:** Reddit's rules on spam require that your submissions be from a diverse range of sources. Once you pass a certain percentage of posts from the same source, you may be labeled a spammer. What is this percentage? * [Responses.](http://i.imgur.com/Gf37bT3.png) * Correct answer: 10%. * Explanation: The reddit.com spam guidelines suggest self-promotion should be limited [to 10% maximum](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion), but in /r/spam the admins ban users who overwhelmingly post from single domains. This is because it is often impossible to tell the difference between persons who are self-promoting and those who simply frequent those websites and as a result tend to share material from them more often then from other sources. In /r/politics, we set the threshold a bit higher, allowing up to 33% of submissions to be from the same source. However, as the question is speaking to the Reddit-wide rule, the correct answer is 10%. **Question 11:** Reddit also has rules about self-promotion and allow for people to promote their own content as long as you: * [Responses.](http://i.imgur.com/nGnfcHk.png) * Correct answer: also post content from other sources and engage with the community in an authentic way. * Explanation: This is addressed specifically in [Reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) and in even more detail under their rules for [self-promotion.](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion) Remember, "it's perfectly fine to be a redditor with a website, it's not okay to be a website with a reddit account." **Question 12:** Which of the following can earn you an immediate site-wide ban? * [Responses.](http://i.imgur.com/yODkC0j.png) * Correct answer: All of the above. (This includes, vote manipulation, spamming, posting personal information, child pornography, and breaking the site or interfering with its normal operation.) * Explanation: At its most basic level, Reddit only has [5 rules.](http://www.reddit.com/rules/) If you break any of these rules, you could earn an immediate site-wide ban. **Question 13:** You should only downvote content when: * [Responses.](http://i.imgur.com/xDc1WFj.png) * Correct answer: it does not contribute to discussion or is inappropriate for the subreddit. * Explanation: Political discussion requires varied opinions. Well written and interesting content can be worthwhile, even if you disagree with it. Downvote only if you think a comment/post does not contribute to the thread it is posted in or if it is off-topic in /r/politics.  gt; Upvotes were built to reward posts that are timely and relevant. Do not use them as an "I agree" button.  gt; Downvotes were built to be a disincentive for content that is off topic. Please do not use them to punish people you disagree with ideologically. * Merit-based voting ensures that the content that adds to the conversation gets exposure. /r/politics is a discussion subreddit, so it's especially important that contrasting views and arguments are exchanged. This rule is also covered in [Reddiquette.](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) **Question 14:** What is the best way that you can impact the content seen in /r/politics? Check all that apply. * [Responses.](http://i.imgur.com/TrhL6ii.png) * Correct answers: * (1) Submit content. * (4) Vote in the new queue. * (5) Report content that violates the rules of /r/politics. * Explanation: This was specifically discussed in our Reddit 101 wiki a few weeks ago. Occasionally, users from a variety of political backgrounds will complain that the front page is dominated by a certain topic or viewpoint. As moderators, we do not set the agenda for the subreddit, rather we enforce the rules which are publicly available. If you dislike the content that you are seeing in /r/politics, then there are three things that you can do to make an impact: * (1) Submit content. If you find certain issues particularly important or interesting, then share them here. You cannot expect other users to do it for you. * (4) Vote in the new queue. You can have the biggest effect on content by voting in the new queue. The early votes have far more power than votes applied after the post makes the front page. For that reason, and because most submissions never reach the general /r/politics page, voting in /r/politics/new sets the agenda for the subreddit. * (5) Report content that violates the rules of /r/politics. If you see content submitted that is not appropriate for /r/politics then you should report it. This allows for content that is relevant and within the rules to be seen by more people for longer periods of time and also prevents bad content from being upvoted to the front page. _____ _____ **Part 2: User Feedback and Suggestions** _____ Many people who participated in the quiz also chose to give us helpful feedback and suggestions. Those optional text questions were not there for laughs. We are paying attention and we appreciate all of the awesome stuff that you all shared. Below you will see some of the most common feedback and the most common and interesting suggestions that we received. *FEEDBACK* * I really enjoy the sub. * Too liberal. Needs more conservative leaning posts. * It is my daily go to for US political info! * I enjoy the comments except when they get personal or start attacking people. * Tendency for 'hot topics' to dominate the top few pages for certain periods of time. *SUGGESTIONS* * It would be nice if there was a submission filter in place. Something similar to what /r/worldnews has started using, except working better. * More things like this! * Make it a default sub again. * Try bringing in an AMA-style discussion featuring two (or more) prominent opposed parties - think moderated debate but instead of being on TV it's on reddit. * Flair to distinguish between sites that are well respected and sites that somebody just happened to find when they googled a news story. * Any article that is primarily a video should be tagged as such. * Have common left and right wing news source list on the side which outline the political leanings of popular sites. * Weekly politics 101 posts which go into the more scholarly aspects of politics. (i.e. Marxism, Realism as a political theory, Communism, etc). Please let us know if you find any of these suggestions particularly exciting. As mods, we are already considering some of them. ____ ____ **Part 3: Winners** ______ Reddit Gold Winners: *Please comment in this thread so I can award you gold.* * ~~/u/StrictScrutiny~~ * ~~/u/aggregaytion~~ * ~~/u/waebi~~ * ~~/u/OMGitzSARS~~ * ~~/u/fuckcancer~~ * ~~/u/lacroixblue~~ * ~~/u/Cryovenom~~ * ~~/u/carmac~~ * ~~/u/FooFighterJL~~ * ~~/u/chip085~~ * ~~/u/airmandan~~ * ~~/u/Amphoras~~ * ~~/u/rikudemyx~~ * ~~/u/Trying2BaWiseGuy~~ * ~~/u/BuckeyeSundae~~ *The strikethrough means that the user has received their Reddit gold* Flair: 204 people won /r/politics flair. The flair is a Captain America Shield and if you mouse over it, it does something special and even has some text. Check it out! The flair will last for 1 month. ___ ___ Special thanks to /u/Sporkicide and the other admins who helped support us with this project. Also, a big thank you to /u/fritzly and /u/nalixor for creating our flair. And of course, thank you to everyone who participated.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Introducing a New Interactive Community Project: The Politics 101 Series</TITLE>
    <DATE>2014-09-09 17:35:05</DATE>
    <TEXT>A few weeks ago, we hosted a quiz and almost 1,000 users participated and many of those users gave us feedback and ideas for the sub. One of those ideas was the Politics 101 series, which we are now making a reality. Several other ideas are still being discussed and developed and may eventually be introduced as well.  #160; ##**What is the Politics 101 series?** It is an interactive community project where YOU can both suggest the weekly topic and help write the content (there is more information about how you can be involved further down in this post). This series will rely on community participation to be successful and lack of community involvement may lead to its discontinuation. A sticky post will be made each Tuesday afternoon and will be up until Thursday night for the current week's topic. These posts will then be cataloged and saved in a portion of our wiki for anyone to reference at any time.  #160; ##**What sort of topics will be discussed?** * Types of government (i.e. Proportional Representation, Socialism, Capitalism, etc) * Structure of Government (i.e. the Supreme Court, electoral college, process for declaring war, etc) * Political Theories (i.e. Realism, Neoconservativism, etc) * Current Legislation (i.e. Obamacare, the DREAM Act, etc) * Politician Profiles (i.e. Rick Perry, Ted Cruz, Hillary Clinton, etc) Our goal is to keep these posts as factual as possible without adding any personal bias. We hope that these posts will not only educate, but also encourage discussion and new ideas. Please, keep the comment section in these Politics 101 posts focused on the current topic and as always, be respectful of other users.  #160; ##**What if I have an idea for a future post? How can I contribute?** A brainstorming self-post will be made by a mod every Saturday morning and will be up until Sunday at midnight. It will announce the next topic and ask for community text contributions - these will not be sticky posts, but rather a normal post which will rely on user votes for visibility.

    <TITLE>Reaction Thread to President Obama's Address to the Nation - September 10, 2014</TITLE>
    <DATE>2014-09-11 04:06:17</DATE>
    <TEXT>~~[Video.](http://www.whitehouse.gov/live)~~ Edit: [Updated video link.](http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2014/09/10/president-obama-we-will-degrade-and-ultimately-destroy-isil) [White House Transcript of the speech.](http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/09/10/remarks-president-barack-obama-address-nation) Transcript: My fellow Americans  #8211; tonight, I want to speak to you about what the United States will do with our friends and allies to degrade and ultimately destroy the terrorist group known as ISIL. As Commander-in-Chief, my highest priority is the security of the American people. Over the last several years, we have consistently taken the fight to terrorists who threaten our country. We took out Osama bin Laden and much of al Qaeda #8217;s leadership in Afghanistan and Pakistan. We #8217;ve targeted al Qaeda #8217;s affiliate in Yemen, and recently eliminated the top commander of its affiliate in Somalia. We #8217;ve done so while bringing more than 140,000 American troops home from Iraq, and drawing down our forces in Afghanistan, where our combat mission will end later this year. Thanks to our military and counterterrorism professionals, America is safer. Still, we continue to face a terrorist threat. We cannot erase every trace of evil from the world, and small groups of killers have the capacity to do great harm. That was the case before 9/11, and that remains true today. That #8217;s why we must remain vigilant as threats emerge. At this moment, the greatest threats come from the Middle East and North Africa, where radical groups exploit grievances for their own gain. And one of those groups is ISIL  #8211; which calls itself the  #8220;Islamic State. #8221; Now let #8217;s make two things clear: ISIL is not  #8220;Islamic. #8221; No religion condones the killing of innocents, and the vast majority of ISIL #8217;s victims have been Muslim. And ISIL is certainly not a state. It was formerly al Qaeda #8217;s affiliate in Iraq, and has taken advantage of sectarian strife and Syria #8217;s civil war to gain territory on both sides of the Iraq-Syrian border. It is recognized by no government, nor the people it subjugates. ISIL is a terrorist organization, pure and simple. And it has no vision other than the slaughter of all who stand in its way. In a region that has known so much bloodshed, these terrorists are unique in their brutality. They execute captured prisoners. They kill children. They enslave, rape, and force women into marriage. They threatened a religious minority with genocide. In acts of barbarism, they took the lives of two American journalists  #8211; Jim Foley and Steven Sotloff. So ISIL poses a threat to the people of Iraq and Syria, and the broader Middle East  #8211; including American citizens, personnel and facilities. If left unchecked, these terrorists could pose a growing threat beyond that region  #8211; including to the United States. While we have not yet detected specific plotting against our homeland, ISIL leaders have threatened America and our allies. Our intelligence community believes that thousands of foreigners  #8211; including Europeans and some Americans  #8211; have joined them in Syria and Iraq. Trained and battle-hardened, these fighters could try to return to their home countries and carry out deadly attacks. I know many Americans are concerned about these threats. Tonight, I want you to know that the United States of America is meeting them with strength and resolve. Last month, I ordered our military to take targeted action against ISIL to stop its advances. Since then, we have conducted more than 150 successful airstrikes in Iraq. These strikes have protected American personnel and facilities, killed ISIL fighters, destroyed weapons, and given space for Iraqi and Kurdish forces to reclaim key territory. These strikes have helped save the lives of thousands of innocent men, women and children. But this is not our fight alone. American power can make a decisive difference, but we cannot do for Iraqis what they must do for themselves, nor can we take the place of Arab partners in securing their region. That #8217;s why I #8217;ve insisted that additional U.S. action depended upon Iraqis forming an inclusive government, which they have now done in recent days. So tonight, with a new Iraqi government in place, and following consultations with allies abroad and Congress at home, I can announce that America will lead a broad coalition to roll back this terrorist threat. Our objective is clear: we will degrade, and ultimately destroy, ISIL through a comprehensive and sustained counter-terrorism strategy. First, we will conduct a systematic campaign of airstrikes against these terrorists. Working with the Iraqi government, we will expand our efforts beyond protecting our own people and humanitarian missions, so that we #8217;re hitting ISIL targets as Iraqi forces go on offense. Moreover, I have made it clear that we will hunt down terrorists who threaten our country, wherever they are. That means I will not hesitate to take action against ISIL in Syria, as well as Iraq. This is a core principle of my presidency: if you threaten America, you will find no safe haven. Second, we will increase our support to forces fighting these terrorists on the ground. In June, I deployed several hundred American service members to Iraq to assess how we can best support Iraqi Security Forces. Now that those teams have completed their work  #8211; and Iraq has formed a government  #8211; we will send an additional 475 service members to Iraq. As I have said before, these American forces will not have a combat mission  #8211; we will not get dragged into another ground war in Iraq. But they are needed to support Iraqi and Kurdish forces with training, intelligence and equipment. We will also support Iraq #8217;s efforts to stand up National Guard Units to help Sunni communities secure their own freedom from ISIL control. Across the border, in Syria, we have ramped up our military assistance to the Syrian opposition. Tonight, I again call on Congress to give us additional authorities and resources to train and equip these fighters. In the fight against ISIL, we cannot rely on an Assad regime that terrorizes its people; a regime that will never regain the legitimacy it has lost. Instead, we must strengthen the opposition as the best counterweight to extremists like ISIL, while pursuing the political solution necessary to solve Syria #8217;s crisis once and for all. Third, we will continue to draw on our substantial counterterrorism capabilities to prevent ISIL attacks. Working with our partners, we will redouble our efforts to cut off its funding; improve our intelligence; strengthen our defenses; counter its warped ideology; and stem the flow of foreign fighters into  #8211; and out of  #8211; the Middle East. And in two weeks, I will chair a meeting of the UN Security Council to further mobilize the international community around this effort. Fourth, we will continue providing humanitarian assistance to innocent civilians who have been displaced by this terrorist organization. This includes Sunni and Shia Muslims who are at grave risk, as well as tens of thousands of Christians and other religious minorities. We cannot allow these communities to be driven from their ancient homelands. This is our strategy. And in each of these four parts of our strategy, America will be joined by a broad coalition of partners. Already, allies are flying planes with us over Iraq; sending arms and assistance to Iraqi Security Forces and the Syrian opposition; sharing intelligence; and providing billions of dollars in humanitarian aid. Secretary Kerry was in Iraq today meeting with the new government and supporting their efforts to promote unity, and in the coming days he will travel across the Middle East and Europe to enlist more partners in this fight, especially Arab nations who can help mobilize Sunni communities in Iraq and Syria to drive these terrorists from their lands. This is American leadership at its best: we stand with people who fight for their own freedom; and we rally other nations on behalf of our common security and common humanity. My Administration has also secured bipartisan support for this approach here at home. I have the authority to address the threat from ISIL. But I believe we are strongest as a nation when the President and Congress work together. So I welcome congressional support for this effort in order to show the world that Americans are united in confronting this danger. Now, it will take time to eradicate a cancer like ISIL. And any time we take military action, there are risks involved  #8211; especially to the servicemen and women who carry out these missions. But I want the American people to understand how this effort will be different from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. It will not involve American combat troops fighting on foreign soil. This counter-terrorism campaign will be waged through a steady, relentless effort to take out ISIL wherever they exist, using our air power and our support for partner forces on the ground. This strategy of taking out terrorists who threaten us, while supporting partners on the front lines, is one that we have successfully pursued in Yemen and Somalia for years. And it is consistent with the approach I outlined earlier this year: to use force against anyone who threatens America #8217;s core interests, but to mobilize partners wherever possible to address broader challenges to international order. My fellow Americans, we live in a time of great change. Tomorrow marks 13 years since our country was attacked. Next week marks 6 years since our economy suffered its worst setback since the Great Depression. Yet despite these shocks; through the pain we have felt and the grueling work required to bounce back  #8211; America is better positioned today to seize the future than any other nation on Earth. Our technology companies and universities are unmatched; our manufacturing and auto industries are thriving. Energy independence is closer than it #8217;s been in decades. For all the work that remains, our businesses are in the longest uninterrupted stretch of job creation in our history. Despite all the divisions and discord within our democracy, I see the grit and determination and common goodness of the American people every single day  #8211; and that makes me more confident than ever about our country #8217;s future. Abroad, American leadership is the one constant in an uncertain world. It is America that has the capacity and the will to mobilize the world against terrorists. It is America that has rallied the world against Russian aggression, and in support of the Ukrainian peoples #8217; right to determine their own destiny. It is America  #8211; our scientists, our doctors, our know-how  #8211; that can help contain and cure the outbreak of Ebola. It is America that helped remove and destroy Syria #8217;s declared chemical weapons so they cannot pose a threat to the Syrian people  #8211; or the world  #8211; again. And it is America that is helping Muslim communities around the world not just in the fight against terrorism, but in the fight for opportunity, tolerance, and a more hopeful future. America, our endless blessings bestow an enduring burden. But as Americans, we welcome our responsibility to lead. From Europe to Asia  #8211; from the far reaches of Africa to war-torn capitals of the Middle East  #8211; we stand for freedom, for justice, for dignity. These are values that have guided our nation since its founding. Tonight, I ask for your support in carrying that leadership forward. I do so as a Commander-in-Chief who could not be prouder of our men and women in uniform  #8211; pilots who bravely fly in the face of danger above the Middle East, and service-members who support our partners on the ground. When we helped prevent the massacre of civilians trapped on a distant mountain, here #8217;s what one of them said.  #8220;We owe our American friends our lives. Our children will always remember that there was someone who felt our struggle and made a long journey to protect innocent people. #8221; That is the difference we make in the world. And our own safety  #8211; our own security  #8211; depends upon our willingness to do what it takes to defend this nation, and uphold the values that we stand for  #8211; timeless ideals that will endure long after those who offer only hate and destruction have been vanquished from the Earth. May God bless our troops, and may God bless the United States of America.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Politics 101 - Week 1. Republic vs Democracy: The founders' vision and where we are now.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2014-09-16 17:19:32</DATE>
    <TEXT>Welcome to the very first Politics 101 post. The topic this week is:  #160; **Republic vs Democracy** * **What did the founders envision?** * **Where does the US government currently stand?**  #160; ____ ____  #160; If you were to ask most Americans what type of government the US has, they would say that it is a democracy. Yet, our "Pledge of Allegiance", which millions of American children recite every morning before school, calls our country a republic.  #160;  gt; I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible with Liberty and Justice for all.  #160; So which one is it and what is the difference? ____  #160; First, let's briefly discuss the definitions of a Republic and a Democracy so that we can dive into the more juicy questions.  #160; ##Republic A republic is a form of government in which power resides in the people, and the government is ruled by elected leaders and run according to law, rather than inherited or appointed. [Source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic) One of the most famous republics in history is the [Roman Republic](http://www.roman-empire.net/republic/rep-index.html) which began in 510BC after the overthrow of the Roman monarchy and lasted ~480 years. The Roman Republic had many elements which are still seen in modern republics today, such as: * Constitution * Consuls (Senators) * Tribunes (Representatives) * Separation of powers * Checks and balances [Source](http://www.ushistory.org/civ/6a.asp) The separation of powers that exists in the US government was inspired by the Roman Republic, where power was divided between the consuls, the tribunes and the different assemblies of the people. This division of power was meant to protect minority rights and ensure that no one arm of the government became stronger than another. [Source](http://leidenlawblog.nl/articles/law-making-at-the-roman-imperial-court) It is also an important distinction between a republic and a democracy.  #160; [Comparison between the US government and the Roman Republic.](http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/rome-balance.asp)  #160; ## Democracy Democracy is a form of government in which all eligible citizens are meant to participate equally  #8211; either directly or, through elected representatives, indirectly  #8211; in the proposal, development and establishment of the laws by which their society is run. In contrast with a republic, a democracy structurally favors majority opinion and typically has fewer protections for minorities. [Source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy) There are two basic forms of democratic governments: * [Direct Democracy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy#Direct), which is a political system where the citizens participate in the decision-making personally, contrary to relying on intermediaries or representatives. * [Representative Democracy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy#Representative), which involves the election of government officials by the people being represented. A characteristic of representative democracy is that while the representatives are elected by the people to act in the people's interest, they retain the freedom to exercise their own judgement as how best to do so. [Athens](http://www.stoa.org/projects/demos/article_democracy_overview?page=all) was one of the first known democracies. The city-state operated as a direct democracy for almost 200 years. The Athenian democracy saw nearly permanent turmoil in its existence, going from being subservient to nearby cities to a regional powerhouse back to subservience based on the outcome of poorly planned and executed wars. [Source](http://classics.mit.edu/Thucydides/pelopwar.html) Aristotle, a Greek philosopher (considered one of the most influential thinkers of ancient times) lived in Athens and wrote in depth about political theory. He was very [critical of democracy as a form of government:](http://www.crf-usa.org/bill-of-rights-in-action/bria-26-1-plato-and-aristotle-on-tyranny-and-the-rule-of-law.html)  gt; For in democracies where the laws are not supreme, demagogues spring up. . . . [T]his sort of democracy . . . [is] what tyranny is to other forms of monarchy. The spirit of both is the same, and they alike exercise a despotic rule over the better citizens. The decrees of the [demagogues] correspond to the edicts of the tyrant . . . . Such a democracy is fairly open to the objection that it is not a constitution at all; for where the laws have no authority, there is no constitution. The law ought to be supreme over all . . . . Aristotle's writings about the dangers of democracies and the importance of constitutions and the rule of law had a profound impact on the Founding Fathers.  #160; ____  #160; ## What did the founders envision for the United States? The founders based many of their ideas for the US system of government off of the writings of John Locke, another notable political philosopher. Locke developed many of his ideas off of the works of Aristotle and [Thomas Hobbes.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Hobbes) He is regarded as one of the most influential forces on the founding fathers and his political philosophy shaped the framework of the United States. In his [Second Treatise of Government](http://www.earlymoderntexts.com/pdfs/locke1689a.pdf), Locke identified the basis of a legitimate government. According to Locke, the duty of that government is to protect the natural rights of the people, which includes life, liberty, and property. If the government should fail to protect these rights, its citizens would have the right to overthrow that government. This idea deeply influenced Thomas Jefferson as he drafted the Declaration of Independence. [Source](http://www.ushistory.org/gov/2.asp) As a result, the founders envisioned the United States as a **[Constitutional Republic:](http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_republic)**  gt; a state in which the head of state and other officials are representatives of the people. They must govern to existing constitution. In a constitutional republic, executive, legislative, and judicial powers can be separated into distinct branches. There is quite a bit of evidence that shows the founders did not want the US government to be a democracy, including: * James Madison, in [Federalist Paper No. 10](http://www.constitution.org/fed/federa10.htm), said that a pure democracy, " there is nothing to check the inducements to sacrifice the weaker party or an obnoxious individual." * At the 1787 Constitutional Convention, Edmund Randolph said, ". . . that in tracing these evils to their origin every man had found it in the turbulence and follies of democracy." * John Adams said, "Remember, democracy never lasts long. It soon wastes, exhausts, and murders itself. There was never a democracy yet that did not commit suicide." [Source](http://econfaculty.gmu.edu/wew/articles/fee/democracy.htm) It is important to realize that the founders feared a system of government which would be dominated by majority rule. In a pure democracy, the majority rules and there is no such thing as a significant minority: there are no minority rights except civil rights (privileges) granted by a condescending majority. [Source](http://www.1215.org/lawnotes/lawnotes/repvsdem.htm) The founders made sure that our Constitution set up a government that has numerous checks and balances to prevent majority rule. Each of the branches of government (executive, legislative, judicial) checks and balances another. There are also systems in place to ensure that the voices of smaller states are not drowned out by larger states (i.e. the House of Representatives vs the Senate, the Electoral College, etc).  #160; ##Where does the US government currently stand? This is a pretty loaded question and one that is hotly debated. Some argue that the US is still a Constitutional Republic that has remained true to the founders' vision. While others believe it is a representative democracy. And yet others argue that the US is now an [oligarchy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligarchy):  gt; a government in which power effectively rests with a small number of people. These people could be distinguished by royalty, wealth, family ties, education, corporate, religious or military control. Such states are often controlled by a few prominent families who typically pass their influence from one generation to the next, but inheritance is not a necessary condition for the application of this term. [Article about study that found the US is an oligarchy](http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-echochambers-27074746) ^*Note:* ^*the* ^*original* ^*study* ^*is* ^*no* ^*longer* ^*publicly* ^*available.* The simple fact of the matter is that there is no right answer. The founders built the framework for the US government intending for it to operate as a Constitutional Republic. However, hundreds of years have passed and there have been political events and technological advances that the founders could not account for. America has transformed over that time and has tried to remain true to the Constitution, but how well have we done? And where do we really stand now?  #160; ___ ____ CREDITS:  #160; Topic suggested by - /u/Coniuratus.  #160; Major text and source contributors: /u/subject6665 and /u/buckeyesundae.  #160; As this was our very first post in the Politics 101 series, everyone who made suggestions in the [introduction thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/2fwxtd/introducing_a_new_interactive_community_project/) and the [brainstorming thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/2gap1u/politics_101_series_brainstorming_session_1/) will be flaired for sharing their ideas and enthusiasm for the project.

    <TEXT>I am re-reading the Harry Potter books and in the 5th book, just after Ron gets his Prefect badge, we find out that James Potter was not a Prefect. The reasoning given was that he caused too much trouble - Harry was comforted by this information. Yet, in other books, we know that James Potter was Head Boy. It seems like often the Head Boy/Girl are chosen from those that were Prefects. So why did James get to be Head Boy without being a Prefect first? Was this an error by JK Rowling?</TEXT>

You can read more about each of the speakers at the link provided above, by clicking "debate details". _____ _____  #160; ##Campaign Finance Laws 1867 - 1980 Let's first delve into a bit of history. Campaign finance laws first made their appearance in the US in 1867 when a law was passed that prohibited Federal officers from requesting contributions from Navy Yard workers. [Source: Fec.gov](http://www.fec.gov/info/appfour.htm) However, more comprehensive reform didn't begin until 1907 when corporate contributions were banned under the [Tillman Act.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tillman_Act_of_1907) This was as a result of a scandal involving Theodore Roosevelt's 1904 presidential campaign. [NPR provides a great rundown of the history of US campaign finance law, which you can look at here.](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=121293380) Additional and notable campaign finance laws include: * [Federal Corrupt Practices Act of 1910 (FCPA)](http://wps.prenhall.com/wps/media/objects/531/544609/Documents_Library/corrupt.htm) which limited contributions and required that federal candidates disclose financial information. * In 1925, this law was revised and substantially strengthened, particularly in its disclosure requirements. * [The Hatch Act of 1939](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatch_Act_of_1939) and its 1940 amendments asserted the right of Congress to regulate primary elections and included provisions limiting contributions and expenditures in Congressional elections. * [The Taft-Hartley Act of 1947](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_Management_Relations_Act_of_1947) barred both labor unions and corporations from making expenditures and contributions in Federal elections. In 1971, Congress passed the Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA), which required full reporting of campaign contributions and expenditures, but also limited spending on media advertisements. These limits on spending in media advertisements were later repealed. The FECA also provided the basic legislative framework for separate segregated funds, popularly referred to as PACs (political action committees), established by corporations and unions. You can read more about the FECA and its amendments [here.](http://www.fec.gov/info/appfour.htm) ^(Much of the text for this section was taken from) [^Fec.gov](http://www.fec.gov/info/appfour.htm). ___  #160; ##PACs, Super PACs, and the BCRA **So what is a PAC?** According to [Opensecrets.org](https://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/pacfaq.php), a PAC is:  gt; a political committee organized for the purpose of raising and spending money to elect and defeat candidates. Most PACs represent business, labor or ideological interests.  #160; **What is a Super PAC?** [Opensecrets.org](https://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/pacfaq.php) explains that a Super PAC is:  gt; A new type of PAC was created after the U.S. Court of Appeals decision in Speechnow v. FEC in 2010. These PACs make no contributions to candidates or parties. They do, however make independent expenditures in federal races - running ads or sending mail or communicating in other ways with messages that specifically advocate the election or defeat of a specific candidate.  #160; **How do they differ?** PAC | Super PAC ---|--------- Established in 1944 | Established in 2010 Contribute directly to a candidate or party committee | No contributions to candidates or parties Up to $5,000 per candidate committee per election. | Make independent expenditures in federal races to communicate with the public. (i.e. ads) Up to $15,000 annually to any national party committee | No limits or restrictions on sources of funds. Up to $5,000 annually to another PAC | File regular financial reports with the FEC, which includes a list of donors and expenditures. May receive up to $5,000 annually from any one individual, PAC, or party committee. | Registers with the Federal Election Committee (FEC) within 10 days of forming. | Treated as 1 donor for the purpose of campaign contribution limits. |  #160; **BCRA** BCRA stands for [Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartisan_Campaign_Reform_Act), which was signed in to law in March 2002. It is:  gt; a United States federal law that amended the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, which regulates the financing of political campaigns. Its chief sponsors were Senators Russ Feingold (D-WI) and John McCain (R-AZ). The Act was designed to address two issues: 1. The increased role of soft money in campaign financing, by prohibiting national political party committees from raising or spending any funds not subject to federal limits, even for state and local races or issue discussion; 2. The proliferation of issue advocacy ads, by defining as "electioneering communications" broadcast ads that name a federal candidate within 30 days of a primary or caucus or 60 days of a general election, and prohibiting any such ad paid for by a corporation (including non-profit issue organizations such as Right to Life or the Environmental Defense Fund) or paid for by an unincorporated entity using any corporate or union general treasury funds. The decision in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission overturns this provision, but not the ban on foreign corporations or foreign nationals in decisions regarding political spending. For more information about the BCRA, you can check out [Cornell University Law School's Legal Information Institute.](http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/bcra) ___ ____  #160; Now with all of that background stuff out of the way, let's jump into the Citizen's United case.  #160; ##What is the Citizens United case? According to [Cornell University Law School's Legal Information Institute](http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/08-205), the Citizens United case stemmed from the BCRA's rules on "electioneering communications", which defines "electioneering communications" as any cable or satellite broadcast made within sixty days before a general election or thirty days before a primary election, and which "refers to a clearly identified candidate for Federal office". Citizens United, a nonprofit corporation, created a movie titled *Hillary: The Movie*, which they planned to air within these timeframes and even conceded that its planned advertisements and VOD broadcast of the movie fall within this definition of "electioneering communications." As a result of falling under this definition, they were subject to provisions 201, 203, and 311 of the BCRA. Section 201 and 311 require:  gt; the disclosure of donors to such communication and a disclaimer when the communication is not authorized by the candidate it intends to support. and Section 203:  gt; prevents corporations or labor unions from funding such communication from their general treasuries.  #160; [Citizens United argued that:](http://www.oyez.org/cases/2000-2009/2008/2008_08_205) 1. Section 203 violates the First Amendment on its face and when applied to The Movie and its related advertisements, and that 2. Sections 201 and 203 are also unconstitutional as applied to the circumstances.  #160; ##What was the main argument? The main focus of the Citizens United case was free speech. They argued that the BCRA prohibited participation in the political process which is guaranteed by the First Amendment. Specifically, the case argued that **political spending is a form of protected speech under the First Amendment, and the government may not keep corporations or unions from spending money to support or denounce individual candidates in elections.** While corporations or unions may not give money directly to campaigns, they may seek to persuade the voting public through other means, including ads, especially where these ads were not broadcast. [Source: Scotus Blog](http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/citizens-united-v-federal-election-commission/)  #160; ___ ##Supreme Court Ruling The ruling was made in January 2010. By a 5-to-4 vote along ideological lines, the majority held that under the First Amendment corporate funding of independent political broadcasts in candidate elections cannot be limited. [Source: oyez.org](http://www.oyez.org/cases/2000-2009/2008/2008_08_205) Yes votes: Chief Justice Roberts, Justice Alito, Justice Scalia, Justice Thomas, and Justice Kennedy. No Votes: Justice Stevens, Justice Ginsburg, Justice Breyer, and Justice Sotomayor. You can read the opinion by Justice Kennedy [here.](http://www2.bloomberglaw.com/public/desktop/document/Citizens_United_v_Federal_Election_Commission_130_S_Ct_876_175_L_)  #160; [oyez.org](http://www.oyez.org/cases/2000-2009/2008/2008_08_205) has an excellent synopsis of the ruling, which reads:  gt; The majority maintained that political speech is indispensable to a democracy, which is no less true because the speech comes from a corporation. The majority also held that the BCRA's disclosure requirements as applied to The Movie were constitutional, reasoning that disclosure is justified by a "governmental interest" in providing the "electorate with information" about election-related spending resources. The Court also upheld the disclosure requirements for political advertising sponsors and it upheld the ban on direct contributions to candidates from corporations and unions.  gt; In a separate concurring opinion, Chief Justice Roberts, joined by Justice Alito, emphasized the care with which the Court handles constitutional issues and its attempts to avoid constitutional issues when at all possible. Here, the Court had no narrower grounds upon which to rule, except to handle the First Amendment issues embodied within the case. Justice Scalia also wrote a separate concurring opinion, joined by Justices Alito and Thomas in part, criticizing Justice Stevens' understanding of the Framer's view towards corporations. Justice Stevens argued that corporations are not members of society and that there are compelling governmental interests to curb corporations' ability to spend money during local and national elections. ____  #160; ## Effects of Citizens United It is important to note that this ruling did not abolish [limits on campaign contributions.](http://www.fec.gov/pages/brochures/contriblimits.shtml) The link contains a chart that outlines the contribution limits for 2013-2014. However, it does allow corporations to contribute to Super PACs which have no limits on source donations or on spending for political communications. The only restriction is that the donor cannot be directly involved in the operation of the Super PAC.  #160; [The Wall Street Journal](http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2014/01/23/new-study-counters-assumptions-about-impact-of-citizens-united/) wrote an article about the findings of a [recent study](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2046878). The study found that there were increases in spending in PACs and nonprofits after the ruling, and also discovered "that the increases weren #8217;t driven by a few, large expenditures  #8212; those exceeding $55,000  #8212; but by larger numbers of mid-range expenditures between $1,000 and $40,000." The New York Times also wrote about the effects of Citizens United in [this article](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/22/magazine/how-much-has-citizens-united-changed-the-political-game.html?pagewanted=all) and others. They even provide a [helpful graphic to illustrate how spending has changed since the ruling.](http://imgur.com/wbzhH3Z) The Washington Post published [this article](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2014/01/21/how-citizens-united-changed-politics-in-6-charts/) complete with 7 charts to show the impact of Citizens United. * [Chart 1](http://imgur.com/WhemIqV) - details all spending by outside groups from 1990-2014.

    <DATE>2014-09-30 16:32:18</DATE>
    <TEXT>Welcome to this week's Politics 101 post. The topic this week is:  #160; **Legislation and Congress**  #160; Specifically: * The Basics * How Does a Bill Become a Law? * Pork Barrel Legislation * Money and Congress * How Members of Congress Spend Their Time  #160; ____ ____  #160; ##The Basics Congress "makes laws that influence our daily lives. It holds hearings to inform the legislative process, conducts investigations to oversee the executive branch, and serves as the voice of the people and the states in the federal government." Of the three branches of government, Congress is the only one elected directly by the people. [Article I](http://constitutioncenter.org/constitution/the-articles/article-i-the-legislative-branch) #8212;the longest article of the Constitution #8212;describes congressional powers. Congress has the power to: * Make laws * Declare war * Raise and provide public money and oversee its proper expenditure * Impeach and try federal officers * Approve presidential appointments * Approve treaties negotiated by the executive branch * Oversight and investigations [Source: visitthecapitol.gov](http://www.visitthecapitol.gov/about-congress#.VCov4CldWIA) _____  #160; ##How a Bill Become a Law? As laid out above, one of the primary tasks of Congress is to make laws to govern the United States. However, many people do not fully understand the process by which that happens. Here are two options for learning about the process:  #160; **Option 1: Whitehouse.gov** For those of you who appreciate a more official explanation, here is the legislative process as laid out by [whitehouse.gov.](http://www.whitehouse.gov/our-government/legislative-branch) There is no way that I can hope to write something more detailed or accurate than the information provided there, so simply click on the link and read away.  #160; **Option 2: Schoolhouse Rock!** Many of you will recall the old Schoolhouse Rock! videos from your youth and they do a great job communicating important information in a simple and easy to digest way. Click the link below to watch.  #160; **[I'm just a bill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyeJ55o3El0)**  #160; Here are a few terms that you might not fully understand that were mentioned in the video: * [Bill:](http://72.32.58.69/learn_about/feature/congressional_glossary.php#bill)  gt; A legislative proposal which would make law if it passes both the House and Senate and if it receives Presidential approval.  gt; Bills are introduced as "H.R." in the House, and as "S." in the Senate. Besides bills, joint resolutions are the only other type of legislation which makes law. They are designated as H.J.Res. in the House and S.J.Res. in the Senate.  #160; You can view historical bill statistics [here.](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/statistics)  #160; To review current bills pending before Congress, visit the [THOMAS website.](http://thomas.loc.gov/home/LegislativeData.php? amp;n=BSS amp;c=108) *Please note: THOMAS is closing soon. Make the switch to [Congress.gov](https://www.congress.gov)*  #160; * [Committee:](http://72.32.58.69/learn_about/feature/congressional_glossary.php#Committees)  gt; Committees are panels of the House or Senate, created to do the initial review of proposed legislation, and decide which measures are worthy of further consideration by the full House or Senate. The committees are each assigned various policy categories to handle, known as jurisdiction.  gt; The House and Senate each have about 20 permanent standing committees. The House and Senate also have select committees, and joint committees.  gt; Every Representative in the House is assigned to work on an average of two committees; while Senators are assigned to an average of four. Members are expected to become specialists in the subject matter under their committee"s jurisdiction.  #160; You can check out each Congressional Committee [here.](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/committees/) The site gives you information about which representatives and senators are on each committee, who chairs the committee, information about the purpose of the committee (along with a link to their specific website), and you can choose to sign up and track their activity as well.  #160; * [Law:](http://72.32.58.69/learn_about/feature/congressional_glossary.php#Law)  gt; Legislation passed by both the House and Senate in identical form and signed by the President, or passed over his veto.  gt; Public Laws affect the nation as a whole; Private Laws affect only one individual or legal entity [such as a single corporation].  #160; * [Veto:](http://72.32.58.69/learn_about/feature/congressional_glossary.php#veto)  gt; The action taken by the President returning a bill to Congress with a message explaining why he refuses to sign it into law. To override his veto and allow the bill to become law anyway, both the House and Senate must pass the bill again, but this time with a 2/3 vote - if all are present that is 290 votes in the House and 67 votes in the Senate.  #160; You can look up more definitions using [this Congressional glossary.](http://72.32.58.69/learn_about/feature/congressional_glossary.php)  #160; ______  #160; ##Pork Barrel Legislation First, let's get [the definition](http://72.32.58.69/learn_about/feature/congressional_glossary.php#PorkBarrel) out of the way:  gt; The term began as a political reference in the post-Civil War era. It comes from the plantation practice of distributing rations of salt pork to slaves from wooden barrels.  gt; When used to describe a bill, it implies the legislation is loaded with special projects for Members of Congress to distribute to their constituents back home, courtesy of the federal taxpayer.  #160; [Wendy McElroy gives a pretty good rundown of the history of pork-barrel legislation in her article at fff.org:](http://fff.org/explore-freedom/article/pork-barrel-spending-the-history-of-lipsticking-pigs/) Pork barrel legislation started in the first Congress, however it did not become a widespread occurrence until the 1980s. Proponents for pork barrel, reference [Article 1 - Section 8 of the Constitution](http://constitutioncenter.org/constitution/the-articles/article-i-the-legislative-branch) for its justification. Specifically, there are two clauses which are commonly used to advocate its legitimacy: * The General-Welfare Clause:  gt;  #8220;The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts and excises, to pay the debts and provide for the common defence and general welfare of the United States. #8221; Pork is said to provide for general welfare, and thus to be permitted by this clause. * The Postal Clause:  gt; which authorizes Congress  #8220;to establish post offices and post roads #8221; as a way to expedite interstate communication. This is now construed to give the federal government the power to appropriate money for public works. The first Congress (1790) authorized pork in the form of $1,500 to complete a lighthouse in Maine, which was then part of Massachusetts. The expenditure had the active support of President George Washington and of Rep. George Thatcher of Massachusetts. While the first Congress did authorize pork, it was by no means a common occurrence. The next attempt at passing pork-barrel legislation was under the second Congress and it was rejected because politicians feared that it would set a "dangerous precedent." In 1817, President Madison vetoed an earmark aimed at funding a national system of roads and waterways because he did not believe the general-welfare clause permitted it. He concluded that  #8220;special-interest issues like internal improvements inexorably corrupted the legislative process. #8221; The next president, James Monroe, vetoed a bill to construct a national road. Unlike Madison, he believed the Constitution empowered Congress to appropriate funds, but he argued for an explicit amendment covering internal improvements. Monroe wanted federal power  #8220;confined to great national works only, since if it were unlimited it would be liable to abuse and might be productive of evil. #8221; Anything other than  #8220;great national works #8221; were the responsibility of the individual states. It appears that pork-barrel legislation did not become common until the mid 1980s; Between FY [fiscal year] 1985 and FY 1999, the growth in annual earmarks increased substantially faster  #8212; between 25 to 1,000 times faster in most cases  #8212; than inflation-adjusted federal domestic discretionary spending. #8230; The number of earmarks in five of the 13 appropriations bills doubled between FY 1998 and FY 1999. [Source: Heritage.org](http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/1999/04/congressional-earmarks-and-spending-undermine-decisionmaking)  #160; And now for some charts to illustrate the points above: * [Number and cost of earmarks by fiscal year 1991 - 2010](http://imgur.com/1Rb0FAg) * [Growth in appropriations earmarks from fiscal year 1985 - 1999](http://imgur.com/LLdIvC3) While there is no denying that pork-barrel spending has become more prolific in today's Congress, you should also be aware that it does not actually involve that much of the national spending. According to [factcheck.org](http://www.factcheck.org/2007/12/pork-barrel-spending/), pork-barrel spending made up about 1% of the national spending in 2007. ______  #160; ##Money and Congress It is no secret that money plays a major role in Congress. Money in politics has grown significantly over the past 50 years; [According to wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Congress_and_citizens), In 1971, the cost of running for congress in Utah was $70,000. Since then, campaign costs have climbed. The biggest campaign expense is television ads, although campaign staff and materials are expensive too. By 1986, the average Senate race cost $3 million; average House races cost $350,000. By 1994, the cost to run for a congressional seat was about $500,000 on average. In the 2008 election, spending for all campaigns (including presidential) approached $2 billion in early 2008. In recent years, the average victor in a Senate race spent close to $7 million, and the average House victor spent over a million dollars. [Opensecrets.org](http://www.opensecrets.org/news/2008/11/money-wins-white-house-and/) states that, The average cost of winning a House race in 2008 was nearly $1.1 million, based on pre-election finance reports, and almost $6.5 million for a Senate seat. Opensecrets.org allows you to look at the cost of a seat in Congress in more detail [here.](https://www.opensecrets.org/bigpicture/stats.php) _____  #160; ##How Members of Congress Spend Their Time But what does this all mean for our Congressmen and women? Well it means that they have to spend more time fundraising and less time working for their constituents. In January 2013, Huffington Post released two images from a powerpoint presentation given to new members of Congress by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee; * The first image outlines a typical day for members of Congress who are in DC. [Image here.](http://imgur.com/yf0568x) * The second image outlines a typical day for members of Congress who are in their home districts. [Image here.](http://imgur.com/RgDILzi) You can read the full HufingtonPost article about this [here.](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/08/call-time-congressional-fundraising_n_2427291.html) The WashingtonPost also published a story about fundraising in Congress in July 2013 and specifically discusses some of the claims made in the HuffingtonPost article. You can read the WashingtonPost article [here.](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/07/29/congress-spends-too-much-time-fundraising-but-its-less-time-than-you-think/) In the WashingtonPost article, the author agrees that fundraising does take up a lot of Congress's time, but not so much as the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee powerpoint suggests that it should.  gt; [it is] possible that there's huge variation in how much time members of Congress spend fundraising. That DCCC schedule might hold true for a new members from a contested district. But House incumbents typically have a 90 percent reelection rate. Most of them are in safe districts. A lot of the money they raise goes to the party rather than to them. They're not going to spend most of their day doing something they hate. [The Congressional Management Foundation conducted a survey](http://www.congressfoundation.org/projects/life-in-congress/the-member-perspective), asking working members of Congress how they spent their time. [The survey results are here.](http://imgur.com/Aov0EfD) In the survey, fundraising falls under the broad category of "political/campaign work". And both when members are in Washington and when they're at home, they report that all political/campaign work takes up less than a fifth of their time -- and only part of that is fundraising. According to the same survey, which was published in 2013:  gt; When in Washington, D.C., Members reported spending their time as follows:  gt; * 35% on  #8220;Legislative/Policy Work #8221;  gt; * 17% on  #8220;Constituent Services Work #8221;  gt; * 17% on  #8220;Political/Campaign Work #8221;  gt; * 9% on  #8220;Press/Media Relations #8221;  gt; * 9% with  #8220;Family/Friends #8221;  gt; * 7% on  #8220;Administrative/Managerial Work #8221;  gt; * 6% on  #8220;Personal Time #8221; And  gt; When in their congressional districts, Members reported spending their time as follows:  gt; * 32% on  #8220;Constituent Services Work #8221;  gt; * 18% on  #8220;Political/Campaign Work #8221;  gt; * 14% on  #8220;Press/Media Relations #8221;  gt; * 12% on  #8220;Legislative/Policy Work #8221;  gt; * 9% with  #8220;Family/Friends #8221;  gt; * 8% on  #8220;Personal Time #8221;  gt; * 7% on  #8220;Administrative/Managerial Work #8221; Additionally, members of Congress report working most weekends out of the year and anywhere between 50 to 70 hours a week depending on whether or not Congress is in session. So even though Congress may not always be in session, your Congressmen and women are still likely working hard on behalf of their constituents, or if you are more pessimistic - working towards their re-election and on behalf of their corporate sponsors.

    <TITLE>Politics 101 - Week 4: The Electoral College</TITLE>
    <DATE>2014-10-07 20:23:31</DATE>
    <TEXT>Welcome to this week's Politics 101 post. The topic this week is:  #160; **The Electoral College**  #160; ____ _____  #160; *We are going to try a new approach this week, so please read the small paragraph below before going any farther:*  #160; This week, we want to encourage discussion on the merits of the electoral college. Does it work? Why or why not? Is there a better system for determining elections? What is it? All of the information below can be used to inform your responses. Ultimately, though, we want everyone to discuss alternative ideas or else explain why the electoral college is the best method. ____ _____  #160; Alright, so now that you know the framework for this week's thread, let's jump right into the information.  #160; ### The Electoral College  #160; First, let's start with a video explanation from the [National Archives and Records Administration.](http://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/about.html) **[Video here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGoL1jYxu5E#t=62)**  #160; You can also listen to the Stuffyoushouldknow Podcast that discusses the electoral college in detail. **[Podcast Audio Link here.](http://www.stuffyoushouldknow.com/podcasts/how-the-electoral-college-works/)**  #160; The Federal Election Commission also has a very detailed PDF about the electoral college that not only provides information on how it works, but also a full history. **[You can read the pdf here.](http://www.fec.gov/pdf/eleccoll.pdf)**  #160; Fairvote.org also has a great FAQ about the electoral college which you can [read here.](http://www.fairvote.org/reforms/national-popular-vote/the-electoral-college/electoral-college-faqs/)  #160; Here is a succinct rundown of the most basic points that are explained in detail in the links provided above: * The electoral college is a process and not an office, a person, or a place. * It was created by the Founding Fathers as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. * Each State is allocated a number of Electors equal to the number of its U.S. Senators (always 2) plus the number of its U.S. Representatives (which may change each decade according to the size of each State's population as determined in the Census). * The [process for selecting Electors](http://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/electors.html#selection) varies throughout the United States. Generally, the political parties nominate Electors at their State party conventions or by a vote of the party #8217;s central committee in each State. Each candidate will have their own unique slate of potential Electors as a result of this part of the selection process. * On Election Day, the voters in each State choose the Electors by casting votes for the presidential candidate of their choice. The Electors #8217; names may or may not appear on the ballot below the name of the candidates running for President, depending on the procedure in each State. * The winning candidate in each State #8212;except in Nebraska and Maine, which have proportional distribution of the Electors #8212;is awarded all of the State #8217;s Electors. In Nebraska and Maine, the state winner receives two Electors and the winner of each congressional district receives one Elector. * There is no Constitutional provision or Federal law that requires Electors to vote according to the results of the popular vote in their States. Some States, however, require Electors to cast their votes according to the popular vote. These pledges fall into two categories #8212;Electors bound by State law and those bound by pledges to political parties.  #160; [Click here to view a list of the State Laws and Requirements for Electors.](http://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/electors.html#selection)  #160; In most presidential elections, the candidate who wins the popular vote will also receive the majority of the electoral votes, but this is not always the case. Only four candidates in U.S. history have won an election by losing the popular vote and winning (or deadlocking) the electoral vote: * 1824: John Quincy Adams, the son of former President John Adams, received some 38,000 fewer votes than Andrew Jackson, but neither candidate won a majority of the Electoral College. Adams was awarded the presidency when the election was thrown to the House of Representatives. * 1876: Nearly unanimous support from small states gave Rutherford B. Hayes a one-vote margin in the Electoral College, despite the fact that he lost the popular vote to Samuel J. Tilden by 264,000 votes. Hayes carried five out of the six smallest states (excluding Delaware). These five states plus Colorado gave Hayes 22 electoral votes with only 109,000 popular votes. At the time, Colorado had been just been admitted to the Union and decided to appoint electors instead of holding elections. So, Hayes won Colorado's three electoral votes with zero popular votes. It was the only time in U.S. history that small state support has decided an election. * 1888: Benjamin Harrison lost the popular vote by 95,713 votes to Grover Cleveland, but won the electoral vote by 65. In this instance, some say the Electoral College worked the way it is designed to work by preventing a candidate from winning an election based on support from one region of the country. The South overwhelmingly supported Cleveland, and he won by more than 425,000 votes in six southern states. However, in the rest of the country he lost by more than 300,000 votes. [Source: U.S. National Archives and Records Administration](http://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/scores.html) * In 2000, Al Gore received 50,992,335 votes nationwide and George W. Bush received 50,455,156 votes. The race was so close in Florida that ineffectively punched ballots (known as "hanging chads") required a manual recount because the voter intent couldn't be deciphered by machine. Eventually, Bush was awarded the state of Florida by the U.S. Supreme Court and had a total of 271 electoral votes, which beat Gore's 266 electoral votes. [Source: factcheck.org](http://www.factcheck.org/2008/03/presidents-winning-without-popular-vote/) Today, a candidate must receive 270 of the 538 votes to win the election. In cases where no candidate wins a majority of electoral votes, the decision is thrown to the House of Representatives by virtue of the 12th Amendment. The House then selects the president by majority vote with each state delegation receiving one vote to cast for the three candidates who received the most electoral votes. [Source for the above section: HowStuffWorks](http://people.howstuffworks.com/electoral-college4.htm)  #160; Also, in January 2013, Gallup did a poll of Americans regarding term limits and the electoral college. [You can view it here.](http://www.gallup.com/poll/159881/americans-call-term-limits-end-electoral-college.aspx) [Here is the data for the electoral college.](http://imgur.com/f7Hw159)  #160; Gallup found that:  gt; Large majorities of Americans are in favor of establishing term limits for members of the U.S. House and Senate, and doing away with the Electoral College. Despite sharp polarization of the parties on many issues in 21st century politics, Republicans and Democrats broadly agree on both longstanding election reform proposals.  #160; ____ _____  #160; Originally, I had intended to also cover gerrymandering in this week's post. However, due to real life time constraints, I was not able to get to it. Sorry guys and gals!

    <TITLE>Politics 101 - Week 5: Gerrymandering</TITLE>
    <DATE>2014-10-15 23:42:30</DATE>
    <TEXT>Welcome to this week's Politics 101 post. The topic this week is:  #160; **Gerrymandering**  #160; Apologies everyone for the late post this week. Real life got in the way. However, the post will run until Friday afternoon to make up for the lost day.  #160; ____ _____  #160; ## Gerrymandering in a Nutshell As always, let's start with some links and media to explain the topic in a succinct and easy to digest way.  #160; CGP Grey has a great video analogy of gerrymandering. **[Click here to watch it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mky11UJb9AY amp;feature=youtu.be)**  #160; Intelligence^2 US had a debate about the two-party system in the US and they touch on the issues of partisan politics and gerrymandering. **[Click here to listen to the debate.](http://intelligencesquaredus.org/debates/past-debates/item/560-the-two-party-system-is-making-america-ungovernable)** and *[Click here to see the research information for the debate, including additional sources of information on gerrymandering.](http://intelligencesquaredus.org/education/item/533-the-two-party-system-is-making-america-ungovernable#gerrymandering)*  #160; Here are a few articles about gerrymandering that might also be of interest: * [Arnold Schwarzenegger's OpEd in the New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/19/opinion/19hill.html?_r=0) * [The Economist: Why do politicians gerrymander?](http://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2013/10/economist-explains-17) * [A multipart series from Bloomberg.com,](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-03-18/republicans-foil-what-most-u-s-wants-with-gerrymandering.html) which includes some wonderful graphics. You can view the [graphics here.](http://www.bloomberg.com/infographics/2013-03-19/redistricting-delivers-north-carolina-to-republicans.html)  #160; For those of you interested in a more detailed and scholarly explanation, you can read the pdf's below. * [A Citizens Guide to Redistricting The Brennan Center at New York U, School of Law.](http://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/legacy/CGR%20Reprint%20Single%20Page.pdf) It is 139 pages. *Authoritative, extensive, easy to follow look at the complexities of redistricting, including recommendations on how states can fix gerrymandering. * [Redistricting, Risk, and Representation: How Five State Gerrymanders Weathered the Tides of the 2000s Election Law Journal, Nicholas M. Goedert (PDF).](http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/pdfplus/10.1089/elj.2014.0261) It is 13 pages, but very dense. _____ ____  #160; ##Gerrymandering - What is it?  #160; Vox put together a terrific article that does a great job explaining all of the facets of gerrymandering. It is very detailed and definitely worth the read. [Click here to read it,](http://www.vox.com/cards/gerrymandering-explained/what-is-gerrymandering) or you can read some of the text below:  gt; In the US, every state elects a certain number of people to the House of Representatives  #8212; a number that's based on the Census count of the state's population. Pennsylvania, for instance, elects 18 House members. So Pennsylvania has to be divided into 18 congressional districts with roughly equal populations. In most US states, this process is controlled by the majority party in the state legislature.  gt; Partisan gerrymandering occurs when this map-drawing process is intentionally used to benefit a particular political party  #8212; to help that party win more seats in the legislature, or more easily protect the ones it has. The goal is to create many districts that will elect members of one party, and only a few that will elect members of the opposite party.  gt; You can see [Pennsylvania's Congressional district map here.](http://imgur.com/A7nho75)  gt; You'll notice that's not a very clean map. It's full of jagged edges and weird outcroppings and sharp turns. That's no accident. The map was drawn by Pennsylvania's Republicans in 2010, and it did its job: though Democrats won the state's popular vote in 2012 - House Republicans won only 49 percent of Pennsylvania's popular vote, they won 72 percent of its House seats. Additionally, it is worth considering that there are different kinds of gerrymandering. Nicholas Goedert's defines "3 types of gerrymanders": * Bipartisan Gerrymander: drawn to protect incumbents of both parties, usually when the state government is under split partisan control. Districts will tend to be ideologically homogenous, with few competitive elections, but a diverse group of legislators elected. * Nonpartisan Gerrymander: A neutral committee draws a map designed to favor neither party. Incumbency may or may not be considered, but in general districts will not be drawn with the goal of electing a certain representative or type of representative. Instead, districts will be internally heterogeneous and competitive elections will be common. * Partisan Gerrymander: One party controls the map-drawing process. They  #8216; #8216;pack #8217; #8217; members of the opposed party into a small number of ideologically homogenous districts, creating some safe incumbents. But they also create a large number of districts that favor their own party. If the map-drawers create districts that tilt only slightly in favor of the majority party, they risk having the map  #8216; #8216;backfire, #8217; #8217; losing many seats in the event of a modestly averse partisan tide. [Text provided by /u/flantabulous] _______  #160; ##How Does Gerrymandering Work?  #160; First, it is important to remember that redistricting is a necessary part of the democratic process. Redistricting is the process of redrawing district lines to better fit the census of an area so that its constituents can be fairly represented. Gerrymandering is a perversion of this process whereby a political party seeks to gain an advantage through the redrawing of these lines. The opportunity for this arises out of the once-a-decade district re-apportionment required by a set of 1960s Supreme Court cases. As voters move into different congressional districts, the population in each of these districts becomes uneven, which results in residents of relatively unpopulated districts having greater representation (because a single vote from a less populated district will comprise a greater proportion of the total votes cast). These Supreme Court cases require state legislatures to redraw districts every ten years (coinciding with the national Census) to ensure that legislative districts are roughly equal in population. In redrawing districts, officeholders can dilute the opposition party #8217;s votes by  #8220;cracking #8221; its voters across several districts, making it more difficult to construct a majority in any district, and can waste the opposition party #8217;s vote by  #8220;packing #8221; its voters into unnecessarily safe districts, reducing its capacity to compete in the remaining districts. [Source: Politicsandpolicy.org](http://politicsandpolicy.org/article/gerrymandering-proving-all-politics-local)  #160; ________  #160; ##Effects of Gerrymandering The New York Times published an excellent article on gerrymandering in 2013, which you can read [here.](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/03/opinion/sunday/the-great-gerrymander-of-2012.html?pagewanted=all amp;_r=0) Below are excerpts from the article that explore the effects in a far more eloquent way than I could: In the 2012 election,  gt; Democrats received 1.4 million more votes for the House of Representatives, yet Republicans won control of the House by a 234 to 201 margin. This is only the second such reversal since World War II.  gt; In 2012 the net effect of intentional gerrymandering was far larger than any one factor.  gt; We can quantify this effect using three different methods. First, Democrats would have had to win the popular vote by 7 percentage points to take control of the House the way that districts are now (assuming that votes shifted by a similar percentage across all districts). That #8217;s an 8-point increase over what they would have had to do in 2010, and a margin that happens in only about one-third of Congressional elections.  gt; Second, if we replace the eight partisan gerrymanders with the mock delegations from my simulations, this would lead to a seat count of 215 Democrats, 220 Republicans, give or take a few.  gt; Third, gerrymandering is a major form of disenfranchisement. In the seven states where Republicans redrew the districts, 16.7 million votes were cast for Republicans and 16.4 million votes were cast for Democrats. This elected 73 Republicans and 34 Democrats. Given the average percentage of the vote it takes to elect representatives elsewhere in the country, that combination would normally require only 14.7 million Democratic votes. Or put another way, 1.7 million votes (16.4 minus 14.7) were effectively packed into Democratic districts and wasted. Sam Wang of the Princeton Election Consortium, who also authored the above NYTimes article, also provides a small representation of the 2012 election results: State| D% Vote| R%Vote | D Seats |R Seats ----------|---|--|-------|----- **Entire House** | 50.4% | 49.6% | 201 | 234 Arizona | 45.6% | 54.4% | 5 | 4 Michigan | 52.7% | 47.3% | 5 | 9 North Carolina | 50.9% | 49.1% | 4 | 9 Pennsylvania | 50.7% | 49.3% | 5 | 13 Wisconsin | 50.8% | 49.2% | 3 | 5 [Source](http://election.princeton.edu/2012/12/30/gerrymanders-part-1-busting-the-both-sides-do-it-myth/) It is important to note that both the Democrats and Republicans do engage in gerrymandering, however it has been more prolific in the Republican Party, especially in recent years. The information provided above focuses on recent elections and as a result shows gerrymandering being controlled by the Republican Party.  #160; ______  #160; ##Alternatives to Gerrymandering [Politicsandpolicy.org](http://politicsandpolicy.org/article/gerrymandering-proving-all-politics-local) discusses the two most popular solutions to gerrymandering:  gt; Unlike in Australia, Canada, or most European countries, anti-gerrymandering reforms have failed to gain much political traction in the United States due to entrenched political interests, however alternatives do exist. The most commonly proposed tactic for eliminating gerrymandering is the creation of an independent and objective commission to draw the boundaries of electoral districts rather than leave this task to the legislature; the United Kingdom and Australia have specially designated commissions for this purpose. These commissions, in the few places where they have been implemented in the United States, are usually made up of relatively apolitical members, selected with the aim of achieving equitable representation of Republicans and Democrats. *Option 1: Commissions*  gt; At present, however, the only American state which consistently draws its electoral districts in this manner is Iowa, whose nonpartisan Legislative Services Bureau has sole oversight of the process. Instances of bipartisan commission failure are more common however; one established by the Missouri legislature after the 2000 Census to redistrict that state infamously ended in intractable deadlock. In 2005 the voters of Ohio soundly rejected a ballot measure that would have established a state-level districting commission. Moreover, employing a commission is no guarantee that gerrymandering will not take place #8212;California #8217;s Congressional districts, for instance, are the result of a bipartisan gerrymander that effectively locks the balance of power in the state #8217;s delegation to the U.S. House of Representatives at the status quo. This strategy was so effective that in 2004 not a single one of California #8217;s 53 House seats changed hands. *Option 2: Technology*  gt; As an alternative to human intervention, some political scientists and mathematicians have developed computer programs and mathematical algorithms to create electoral districts. One examples is the  #8220;shortest splitline algorithm #8221; created by the Center for Range Voting which uses a computer to divide a state into the appropriate number of evenly populated districts using the shortest possible straight lines. Another example is a program written by software engineer Brian Olson which places voters in districts such that the average distance from a voter to the center of his or her district is minimized. Although solutions of this kind do create unbiased districts, whether or not such districts are fair is subjective; since algorithmic solutions have no concept of  #8220;communities of interest, #8221; they can result in splitting a single city into multiple districts or lumping communities with very different interests (but geographic proximity) into the same district.  #160; _____ ____  #160; Discussion: What do you think about Gerrymandering? Is it a necessary part of democracy? Is it a net positive or negative? Are there any realistic solutions that can be implemented? What other solutions do you think there are that have not been mentioned here? Which solution is best? Ofcourse there are many other avenues of discussion, but those are just some jumping off points to get it started.  #160; Sources and credits are listed in the comment section.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Politics 101: The midterm elections are almost here. Get out and vote!</TITLE>
    <DATE>2014-10-28 15:05:30</DATE>
    <TEXT>The midterm elections are less than a week away. These elections often see a much lower turnout then Presidential election years, but they are no less important. There is a lot at stake this year and it is important that you go out and vote to make sure that your voice is heard.  #160; This week's politics 101 post will focus on: 1. Voter Resources. (How do I vote? Where do I go? Who is running? What do they stand for? etc) 2. Voter turnout in midterm vs Presidential election years. 3. Why it is important to vote? What is at stake?  #160; ____ _____  #160; ## 1. Voter Resources  #160; **How do I vote? Where do I go? What do I do?** * For links to all state voting authorities, where you can find out poll hours, locations, voting rules, etc. **[The Elections Assistance Commission] (http://www.eac.gov/voter_resources/contact_your_state.aspx)**.  #160; **Where do I go to vote?** Go to **[Vote411.org](http://www.vote411.org/enter-your-address#.VE6yvpPF9DF)** and enter your address to find out where to vote and if any ID is required. You can also go to **[Rockthevote.com](http://www.rockthevote.com/)** and enter your address to find your polling place, voter ID requirements, and information about the races in your state.  #160; Additionally, each county in every state has a County Elections Department/Division that is responsible for coordinating the elections in their respective boundaries. Many of these counties host a voter look-up site for constituents to determine their voting precinct, their congressional district, and the physical address of their polling site Example: http://www.traviscountyclerk.org/eclerk/Content.do?code=E.18  #160; **Who is up for election in my area? What do they stand for?** * **[Ballotpedia](http://ballotpedia.org/Main_Page)** gives a non-partisan overview of races and ballot issues in each state. * **[Judgpedia](http://judgepedia.org/Main_Page)** gives a non-partisan overview of judicial races in each state. * **[VoteSmart](http://votesmart.org/)** lets you research candidates, their records, endorsements, funding. * **[Congress.gov/members](https://www.congress.gov/members?q={%22congress%22%3A113%2C%22chamber%22%3A%22Senate%22} amp;pageSize=2500)** provides a searchable list of Senators that give their biographic information and voting record. * **[Congress.gov/committees](https://www.congress.gov/committees)** has links to the subcommittees and their members; this is where the voter can find which committees the legislator sits on and offers a good indication of legislative power. * **[House.gov/representatives](http://www.house.gov/representatives/find/)** will help you find your House representative, and provides biographical information along with voting record. * **[Opensecrets.org](http://www.opensecrets.org/)** offers information about the money behind each candidate's election/re-election.  #160; **What do the ballots look like?** Sample ballots for state  amp; national elections are often posted at the website for the Elections Department/Division of each Secretary of State in most states. This is useful for reviewing obtusely worded propositions. Examples: http://votetexas.gov/voting/what/ http://www.sos.state.tx.us/elections/forms/sample-ballot-2014.pdf  #160; A simple google search for "sample ballots by state" or "sample ballot for [insert state here]" should yield the information you are looking for.  #160; For instance, [this is a sample ballot](http://myballotmn.sos.state.mn.us/ShowImage.aspx?i=048DEF0F-D5EC-4325-A685-FA39E1FEC201) for zip code 56431 in Aitkin Township, Minnesota.  #160; _____  #160; ##2. Voter Turnout Fairvote.org has an excellent graph that explains voter turnout trends for midterm elections vs Presidential elections. [This graph shows turnout from 1948-2012.](http://i.imgur.com/knT3TrK.png) Notice that in recent years, voter turnout is almost 20% lower in midterm election years than in Presidential election years. Now let's break it down a bit more and look at who shows up to vote in elections. [Source: Fairvote.org](http://www.fairvote.org/research-and-analysis/voter-turnout/what-affects-voter-turnout-rates/) * *Age*: Young people are much less likely to vote than older ones. From 1972 to 2012, citizens 18-29 years old turned out at a rate 15 to 20 points lower than citizens 30 year and older. For more about the youth vote, [click here.](http://www.civicyouth.org/quick-facts/youth-voting/) * *Race/Ethnicity*: Voter turnout also varies by race and ethnicity. In 2012, turnout rates among eligible white and black voters was 64.1% and 66.2%, respectively, while it was only 48.0% and 47.3% among Latino and Asian American voters respectively. The 2012 election was the first presidential election in which black turnout exceeded white turnout. * *Gender*: Women's voter turnout has surpassed men's in every presidential election since 1980. In the 2012 election, 7.8 more women than men voted. Interestingly though, older women are actually less like to vote than older men. In 2008, 72.2% of men 75 years and older voted, compared to only 64.9% of women that age. * *Socio-economic Status*: Wealthy Americans vote at much higher rates than those of lower socio-economic status. During the 2008 presidential election, only 41% of eligible voters making less than $15,000 a year voted, compared to 78% of those making $150,000 a year or more. Studies have shown that this difference in turnout affects public policy: politicians are more likely to respond to the desires of their wealthy constituents than of their poorer constituents, in part because more of their wealthy constituents vote. Remember, the numbers above are including Presidential election years, so during midterm election years, the turnout percentages for certain groups is actually much lower. Nonprofitvote.org has an excellent pdf that breaks down voter turnout for the 2010 midterm elections, which you can read [here.](http://www.nonprofitvote.org/documents/2011/11/voter-participation-gaps-in-the-2010-midterm-election.pdf) Below are some graphics that illustrate the voter turnout gaps that they discuss in the pdf: * [Voter turnout by age in 2010.](http://i.imgur.com/PUjz1xC.png) * [Voter turnout by race/ethnicity in 2010.](http://i.imgur.com/A091pep.png) * [Voter turnout by income in 2010.](http://i.imgur.com/f1K2hrI.png)  #160; _____  #160; ##3. Why should I vote? What is at stake? Congress has one of the lowest approval ratings in its history and yet our politicians can still expect a ~90% re-election rate. They have no motivation to change their platforms or to work together to make changes that are in line with their constituency. If you are passionate at all about any issue, then you should head to the polls and vote for the individuals who represent you and your ideals best. In 2010, the Congressional approval rating was just 21% [source: Gallup](http://www.gallup.com/poll/171671/key-midterm-election-indicators-near-historical-lows.aspx) However, 85% of the members of the House were re-elected and 84% of the Senate members were re-elected. [Source: OpenSecrets.org](https://www.opensecrets.org/bigpicture/reelect.php) * [House Re-election rates 1964 - 2012](http://i.imgur.com/evYt1kK.png) * [Senate Re-election rates 1964 - 2012](http://i.imgur.com/uYSvI4D.png) This year, Gallup shows just a 16% approval rating for Congress. According to [270towin.com](http://www.270towin.com/2014-senate-election/):  gt; The current U.S. Senate has 53 Democrats and 45 Republicans. There are two independents who caucus with the Democrats, effectively giving them control of 55 seats. The 2014 Senate elections will take place on November 4, 2014. There are 36 races, of which 33 are on a normal six-year cycle. There are special elections in Hawaii, Oklahoma and South Carolina. In the latter two states, these special elections coincide with a regular election.  gt; The 36 Senate seats are currently held by 21 Democrats and 15 Republicans. Of those 36 incumbents, five Democrats and two Republicans are retiring; an additional Republican is resigning in early 2015, at the conclusion of the 113th Congress. Right now, fivethirtyeight.com is projecting that the Republicans have a 63.3% chance of taking control of the Senate. The website has one of the best **[interactive election graphics](http://fivethirtyeight.com/interactives/senate-forecast/)** that I have seen. Most pollsters are also predicting with nearly 100% certainty that the Republicans will maintain control of the House of Representatives as well. The WashingtonPost has put together **an [Election Lab](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dre/politics/election-lab-2014)** where you can look at each race more closely. If you are a Democrat, then you should feel compelled to vote so that your party can keep control of the Senate and maybe even win a few seats in the House. If you are a Republican, then you should be motivated to vote so that your party can take control of the Senate. If you are an independent or affiliated with a third party, then you should likewise get out and vote so that your ideals are represented. Your vote can make a very real difference this election year. Voter turnout is already low, so every vote that is cast this year has a much bigger impact on the results.  #160; _____ ____  #160; **Get out and vote! It doesn't matter what your party affiliation is, go out and make sure your voice is heard.**  #160; Credits to: /u/flantabulous /u/madam1 /u/forthouston /u/intrepidone66 for helping to gather the resources and participating in the brainstorming post.

    <TITLE>Fantasy Election + Trash Talk Megathread</TITLE>
    <DATE>2014-11-01 15:43:36</DATE>
    <TEXT>The midterm elections are nearly here and /r/politics has some great stuff planned. Make sure to stop by on election day to get involved! This thread is a fantasy election and trash talk thread. Read below to find out about the rules and the grand prize. Edit: The fantasy election is now closed. Join us on Tuesday for our special election threads. _____ _____  #160; ## Fantasy Election Rules  #160; Read **all** of the instructions below (especially the scoring) before filling out the google form:  #160; 1. **[Click here to go to the google form.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1qc5LE3XKnO2wxJNr6x_6cT4vGEkjhf9kYJh2BbrTPSs/viewform?usp=send_form)** 2. Choose a winner for each race. The first section is for Safe races, the second section is for the Likely races, the third section is for the Toss-up races, and the last section is for the two bonus questions and the tie-breaker. 3. The google form will be closed on Sunday night at 11:59pm EST. No submissions can be made after that time. 4. The comment section of this thread is for trash talk. 5. Our civility rules will be relaxed for the trash talk thread, but **only** in this thread. No calls for violence/death will be tolerated.  #160; ##Scoring * For Safe Seats, correctly predicting an upset is +5 points (an upset being the supposed Safe seat going to anyone other than the presumed winner), but incorrect guesses of upsets are worth -5 points (otherwise, one could just guess an upset for every race). You get 0 points for selecting the projected winner. * For Likely Seats, correct predictions are worth +1 point, incorrect guesses are worth -1. Again, to reflect the safe-bet nature of picking the winner of these seats. * For Toss-ups, since these are statistically the hardest ones to pick, this is where I envision the meat and potatoes of the scoring to take place. Correct guesses are worth +3 points, but no points are lost for incorrect guesses. * For each correct answer in the Bonus Section, you will earn +3 points, with a total of 6 bonus points available. No points will be deducted for a wrong answer in this section. * There is also a tie-breaker question.  #160; ##Grand Prize Besides winning bragging rights around the sub, you will also get a 1 month flair declaring you the King/Queen of Politics as well as 1month of Reddit Gold.  #160; *Please note that if you would like to track your lineup and score during election night, you will have to write your selections down separately.* We will also have a leaderboard posted on election night with the scores being regularly updated.  #160; _____  #160; Good Luck! ^(But for real, I am going to crush you all. Losers!)  #160; ________ _______</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Politics 101: Midterm Ballot Initiatives Recap</TITLE>
    <DATE>2014-11-13 06:17:14</DATE>
    <TEXT>The Midterm Elections are over and there has been a huge amount of coverage discussing the Republican victories in the House and Senate. As we all know by now, the Republicans have gained control of the Senate and many of the "close" races ended up not being very close at all. However, there has not been much discussion about the ballot initiatives that passed and failed across the US (aside from the marijuana legalization measures). So, let's check it all out.  #160; ##This Politics 101 post will discuss: * Ballot initiatives in cities and states across the USA and whether they passed or failed. * Trends and the potential measures for 2016.  #160; ##Discussion We'd like the discussion this week to really focus on why so many progressive ballot measures passed and yet so many Republicans were elected to Congress. What does this say about the US and our political parties? Which of these ballot initiatives do you think is the most promising?  #160; _______ ________  #160; ##Ballot Initiatives  #160; You can go through the [full list of ballot initiatives here.](http://ballotpedia.org/2014_ballot_measures) You can view the 2014 Midterm Election scorecard [here.](http://ballotpedia.org/Ballot_Measure_Scorecard,_2014#November_4) According to ballotpedia.org:  gt; One hundred fifty-eight (158) statewide ballot questions were certified for spots on 42 statewide ballots in 2014.  gt; Twelve of these measures were on pre-November ballots, leaving 146 for a decision on November 4.

PASSED with 58% of the vote. * Initiative 591 - prevents confiscation of firearms without due process and also prevents the implementation of more extensive background checks than those at the federal level. FAILED with 54% of the vote.  #160; ________  #160; ##Summary of Trends and Potential for 2016  #160; *MOST POPULAR:* People highly favored the raising of the minimum wage and it succeeded in every state where it appeared on the ballot. This issue will almost certainly show up on ballots in more states in 2016.  #160; *LEGALIZE IT:* Marijuana legalization/decriminalization is becoming increasingly popular and it is HIGHLY probable that it will appear on the ballot in upcoming elections. The issue is gaining momentum and continued success could lead to significant changes at a federal level.  #160; *IT'S ALIVE!:* Personhood made it on to several state ballots this year, but did not fare well. Only the more tempered version in Tennessee succeeded. Proponents for personhood may take this as a sign that less aggressive wording will garner better results at the polls while also achieving the same ends. I would not be surprised to see more restrained personhood bills in future elections.  #160; *IS THAT....EDIBLE?:* GMO labeling also appears to be an increasingly hot topic and I expect that the issue will be raised again in 2016.  #160;</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Discussion Thread: Presidential Address on Immigration</TITLE>
    <DATE>2014-11-21 01:27:49</DATE>
    <TEXT>Tonight at 8pm Eastern, President Obama will be giving an address about immigration. It will not be aired on all networks. ~~Below you will find a list of networks who will be broadcasting the address, as well as links to live streams and live blogs.~~ After the address concludes, we will post the transcript and a link to a video replay. Edit: The post has now been updated. __________ *We recommend sorting by NEW while the address is taking place and then switching to BEST once the address is over.* ______ _______  #160; **Video Replay of the Speech:** [Whitehouse.gov video](http://www.whitehouse.gov/issues/immigration/immigration-action)  #160; **Transcript of the Speech:** [Transcript](http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/11/20/remarks-president-address-nation-immigration) 8:01 P.M. EST THE PRESIDENT: My fellow Americans, tonight, I #8217;d like to talk with you about immigration. For more than 200 years, our tradition of welcoming immigrants from around the world has given us a tremendous advantage over other nations. It #8217;s kept us youthful, dynamic, and entrepreneurial. It has shaped our character as a people with limitless possibilities  #8211;- people not trapped by our past, but able to remake ourselves as we choose. But today, our immigration system is broken -- and everybody knows it. Families who enter our country the right way and play by the rules watch others flout the rules. Business owners who offer their workers good wages and benefits see the competition exploit undocumented immigrants by paying them far less. All of us take offense to anyone who reaps the rewards of living in America without taking on the responsibilities of living in America. And undocumented immigrants who desperately want to embrace those responsibilities see little option but to remain in the shadows, or risk their families being torn apart. It #8217;s been this way for decades. And for decades, we haven #8217;t done much about it. When I took office, I committed to fixing this broken immigration system. And I began by doing what I could to secure our borders. Today, we have more agents and technology deployed to secure our southern border than at any time in our history. And over the past six years, illegal border crossings have been cut by more than half. Although this summer, there was a brief spike in unaccompanied children being apprehended at our border, the number of such children is now actually lower than it #8217;s been in nearly two years. Overall, the number of people trying to cross our border illegally is at its lowest level since the 1970s. Those are the facts. Meanwhile, I worked with Congress on a comprehensive fix, and last year, 68 Democrats, Republicans, and independents came together to pass a bipartisan bill in the Senate. It wasn #8217;t perfect. It was a compromise. But it reflected common sense. It would have doubled the number of border patrol agents while giving undocumented immigrants a pathway to citizenship if they paid a fine, started paying their taxes, and went to the back of the line. And independent experts said that it would help grow our economy and shrink our deficits. Had the House of Representatives allowed that kind of bill a simple yes-or-no vote, it would have passed with support from both parties, and today it would be the law. But for a year and a half now, Republican leaders in the House have refused to allow that simple vote. Now, I continue to believe that the best way to solve this problem is by working together to pass that kind of common sense law. But until that happens, there are actions I have the legal authority to take as President  #8211;- the same kinds of actions taken by Democratic and Republican presidents before me - #8211; that will help make our immigration system more fair and more just. Tonight, I am announcing those actions. First, we #8217;ll build on our progress at the border with additional resources for our law enforcement personnel so that they can stem the flow of illegal crossings, and speed the return of those who do cross over. Second, I #8217;ll make it easier and faster for high-skilled immigrants, graduates, and entrepreneurs to stay and contribute to our economy, as so many business leaders have proposed. Third, we #8217;ll take steps to deal responsibly with the millions of undocumented immigrants who already live in our country. I want to say more about this third issue, because it generates the most passion and controversy. Even as we are a nation of immigrants, we #8217;re also a nation of laws. Undocumented workers broke our immigration laws, and I believe that they must be held accountable - #8211; especially those who may be dangerous. That #8217;s why, over the past six years, deportations of criminals are up 80 percent. And that #8217;s why we #8217;re going to keep focusing enforcement resources on actual threats to our security. Felons, not families. Criminals, not children. Gang members, not a mom who #8217;s working hard to provide for her kids. We #8217;ll prioritize, just like law enforcement does every day. But even as we focus on deporting criminals, the fact is, millions of immigrants in every state, of every race and nationality still live here illegally. And let #8217;s be honest - #8211; tracking down, rounding up, and deporting millions of people isn #8217;t realistic. Anyone who suggests otherwise isn #8217;t being straight with you. It #8217;s also not who we are as Americans. After all, most of these immigrants have been here a long time. They work hard, often in tough, low-paying jobs. They support their families. They worship at our churches. Many of their kids are American-born or spent most of their lives here, and their hopes, dreams, and patriotism are just like ours. As my predecessor, President Bush, once put it:  #8220;They are a part of American life. #8221; Now here #8217;s the thing: We expect people who live in this country to play by the rules. We expect that those who cut the line will not be unfairly rewarded. So we #8217;re going to offer the following deal: If you #8217;ve been in America for more than five years; if you have children who are American citizens or legal residents; if you register, pass a criminal background check, and you #8217;re willing to pay your fair share of taxes -- you #8217;ll be able to apply to stay in this country temporarily without fear of deportation. You can come out of the shadows and get right with the law. That #8217;s what this deal is. Now, let #8217;s be clear about what it isn #8217;t. This deal does not apply to anyone who has come to this country recently. It does not apply to anyone who might come to America illegally in the future. It does not grant citizenship, or the right to stay here permanently, or offer the same benefits that citizens receive - #8211; only Congress can do that. All we #8217;re saying is we #8217;re not going to deport you. I know some of the critics of this action call it amnesty. Well, it #8217;s not. Amnesty is the immigration system we have today - #8211; millions of people who live here without paying their taxes or playing by the rules while politicians use the issue to scare people and whip up votes at election time. That #8217;s the real amnesty  #8211;- leaving this broken system the way it is. Mass amnesty would be unfair. Mass deportation would be both impossible and contrary to our character. What I #8217;m describing is accountability  #8211;- a common-sense, middle-ground approach: If you meet the criteria, you can come out of the shadows and get right with the law. If you #8217;re a criminal, you #8217;ll be deported. If you plan to enter the U.S. illegally, your chances of getting caught and sent back just went up. The actions I #8217;m taking are not only lawful, they #8217;re the kinds of actions taken by every single Republican President and every single Democratic President for the past half century. And to those members of Congress who question my authority to make our immigration system work better, or question the wisdom of me acting where Congress has failed, I have one answer: Pass a bill. I want to work with both parties to pass a more permanent legislative solution. And the day I sign that bill into law, the actions I take will no longer be necessary. Meanwhile, don #8217;t let a disagreement over a single issue be a dealbreaker on every issue. That #8217;s not how our democracy works, and Congress certainly shouldn #8217;t shut down our government again just because we disagree on this. Americans are tired of gridlock. What our country needs from us right now is a common purpose  #8211;- a higher purpose. Most Americans support the types of reforms I #8217;ve talked about tonight. But I understand the disagreements held by many of you at home. Millions of us, myself included, go back generations in this country, with ancestors who put in the painstaking work to become citizens. So we don #8217;t like the notion that anyone might get a free pass to American citizenship. I know some worry immigration will change the very fabric of who we are, or take our jobs, or stick it to middle-class families at a time when they already feel like they #8217;ve gotten the raw deal for over a decade. I hear these concerns. But that #8217;s not what these steps would do. Our history and the facts show that immigrants are a net plus for our economy and our society. And I believe it #8217;s important that all of us have this debate without impugning each other #8217;s character. Because for all the back and forth of Washington, we have to remember that this debate is about something bigger. It #8217;s about who we are as a country, and who we want to be for future generations. Are we a nation that tolerates the hypocrisy of a system where workers who pick our fruit and make our beds never have a chance to get right with the law? Or are we a nation that gives them a chance to make amends, take responsibility, and give their kids a better future? Are we a nation that accepts the cruelty of ripping children from their parents #8217; arms? Or are we a nation that values families, and works together to keep them together? Are we a nation that educates the world #8217;s best and brightest in our universities, only to send them home to create businesses in countries that compete against us? Or are we a nation that encourages them to stay and create jobs here, create businesses here, create industries right here in America? That #8217;s what this debate is all about. We need more than politics as usual when it comes to immigration. We need reasoned, thoughtful, compassionate debate that focuses on our hopes, not our fears. I know the politics of this issue are tough. But let me tell you why I have come to feel so strongly about it. Over the past few years, I have seen the determination of immigrant fathers who worked two or three jobs without taking a dime from the government, and at risk any moment of losing it all, just to build a better life for their kids. I #8217;ve seen the heartbreak and anxiety of children whose mothers might be taken away from them just because they didn #8217;t have the right papers. I #8217;ve seen the courage of students who, except for the circumstances of their birth, are as American as Malia or Sasha; students who bravely come out as undocumented in hopes they could make a difference in the country they love. These people  #8211;- our neighbors, our classmates, our friends  #8211;- they did not come here in search of a free ride or an easy life. They came to work, and study, and serve in our military, and above all, contribute to America #8217;s success. Tomorrow, I #8217;ll travel to Las Vegas and meet with some of these students, including a young woman named Astrid Silva. Astrid was brought to America when she was four years old. Her only possessions were a cross, her doll, and the frilly dress she had on. When she started school, she didn #8217;t speak any English. She caught up to other kids by reading newspapers and watching PBS, and she became a good student. Her father worked in landscaping. Her mom cleaned other people #8217;s homes. They wouldn #8217;t let Astrid apply to a technology magnet school, not because they didn #8217;t love her, but because they were afraid the paperwork would out her as an undocumented immigrant  #8211;- so she applied behind their back and got in. Still, she mostly lived in the shadows  #8211;- until her grandmother, who visited every year from Mexico, passed away, and she couldn #8217;t travel to the funeral without risk of being found out and deported. It was around that time she decided to begin advocating for herself and others like her, and today, Astrid Silva is a college student working on her third degree. Are we a nation that kicks out a striving, hopeful immigrant like Astrid, or are we a nation that finds a way to welcome her in? Scripture tells us that we shall not oppress a stranger, for we know the heart of a stranger  #8211;- we were strangers once, too. My fellow Americans, we are and always will be a nation of immigrants. We were strangers once, too. And whether our forebears were strangers who crossed the Atlantic, or the Pacific, or the Rio Grande, we are here only because this country welcomed them in, and taught them that to be an American is about something more than what we look like, or what our last names are, or how we worship. What makes us Americans is our shared commitment to an ideal - #8211; that all of us are created equal, and all of us have the chance to make of our lives what we will. That #8217;s the country our parents and grandparents and generations before them built for us. That #8217;s the tradition we must uphold. That #8217;s the legacy we must leave for those who are yet to come. Thank you. God bless you. And God bless this country we love. END 8:16 P.M.

We are still awaiting confirmation from the press conference. 8:15pm - Press conference has started. Updates below are from the Press Conference: * Holder announced federal investigation just days after the shooting. Federal investigators worked closely with local law enforcement. * There were no pre-conceived decisions on this case. They reviewed it fairly and tried to make an informed decision. * Evidence was immediately shared between federal and local investigators. * All testimony before the grand jury was immediately provided to the Department of Justice. * Though the investigations were separate, the local and Federal investigation teams have the same information. * The media has made this case even more difficult - caused distrust in the community and the propagation of misinformation. * Witnesses made inconsistent statements that were refuted (either in part or completely) by physical evidence. Some of these statements also changed over time and conflicted with earlier statements. * Some witnesses did not witness the shooting at all, but merely claimed that they had. * All witness statements were recorded prior to the media circus. * Some witness statements were consistent throughout and were also consistent with physical evidence. * All 12 jurors were present for every testimony. * All jurors were very engaged - asking questions, requesting information, and asking for evidence. * Met for 25 days and heard 72? hours of testimony. * Heard from 3 medical examiners and numerous experts. * Instructed on the law and given 5 indictments from murder to manslaughter. * Needed to determine if there was probably cause to indict Darren Wilson on these charges. * The law allows Police to use deadly force. * The duty of the grand jury is to separate fact from fiction. * The grand jury are the ONLY people who have heard and examined all evidence. * The grand jury deliberated over 2 days and determined that **no probable cause exists to charge Darren Wilson with any of the 5 charges.** * Witnesses said that they saw a fight (or tussle) inside the Police vehicle. * The vehicle and Officer Wilson's clothing were examined and Brown's blood and DNA were found on the inside of the driver's door, Officer Wilson's clothing and gun. * 2 shots were fired from inside the car. * 1 bullet was found in the car. * All three autopsies performed were consistent. * Soot found on wound on hand consistent with a close range gunshot. * Darren Wilson had some redness and swelling to his face according to hospital records. * Brown ran away. Witnesses had varying reports as to when the next shots were fired. * Several witnesses said that he did not raise his hands at all, or raised them briefly. * Witnesses are inconsistent as to whether or not he charged Wilson or stood still. * The most credible witnesses claimed that Brown moved towards Wilson when he was shot again. * Physical evidence does not support testimony that said Brown's hands were raised above his head. * All of the information seen by the Grand Jury will be made public. 9:10pm - President Obama makes statement about decision and events in Ferguson. Encourages peace. As of 10pm - * Atleast 2 cop cars have been set on fire. * Shots have been fired in multiple locations * Looting has been occurring in multiple locations. * The entire inside of Walgreens is currently on fire (according to Police scanner). 10:15pm - ToysRUs being looted. 15 vehicles and approx 40-50 people. 10:20pm - Protesters have completely blocked I-44 (a major highway through St. Louis) on both sides.

    <TITLE>Santas, let's have a chat about this year and what we can do better next year.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2014-12-26 08:44:42</DATE>
    <TEXT>Merry Christmas everyone! I hope your holiday was fantastic. RAOC was a lot of fun this year. Santas, thank you all for your generosity - you made a lot of children very happy this Christmas. However, we all know that there were some dark spots this year too. We had a LOT of people double-dipping in other subs, without disclosing it. We had people deleting posts, making requests too often, and requesting toys for their kids even after they had reached the maximum. There were also some scammers - we caught quite a few of them before they could get too far, but there were also a few that slipped by. So, given some of the points above, we'd like to hear your thoughts on the following points: 1. What can we do better? 2. What new rules can we implement? 3. What other checks can we put in place to ensure that a request is legitimate? 4. What other issues did you notice? And how might we resolve those for next year? 5. Will you be returning next year as a Santa? Why or why not? Requestors, we also welcome your feedback. How was your experience? What are your thoughts on all of this?  #160; Thank you all again for your generosity and wonderful Christmas spirit. __________ **Edit: There will be a post tomorrow which will go over all of the suggestions and give feedback from the mod team's perspective.**</TEXT>

    <TITLE>New Rule Discussion for Next Year. Please read and discuss.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2014-12-27 21:08:59</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hello Everyone, Thank you all so much for your feedback on [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/RandomActsOfChristmas/comments/2qfj35/santas_lets_have_a_chat_about_this_year_and_what/) about how we can improve for next year. There were a lot of excellent comments from Santas and Requestors alike. The mod team has read all of them and made a tentative list of the suggestions that we will be considering for implementation for next year. Please note that this list is in no way final - we will be discussing them in more detail over the coming days and weeks in order to ensure a better RAOC experience for next year. **List of Potential New Rules** * Minimum reddit account age of 3 months with an active user history. * Requestors must be at least 18 years of age. We will allow requests from teen parents or from parents using their children's reddit accounts, but extra information may be requested by the mod team to verify these points. * No requests for children under the age of 1 year. * No requests for food, diapers, bassinets, beds, etc. These requests would be better suited to /r/foodpantry or /r/assistance. Requests for clothing will still be allowed. * Additional verification requirements, such as: facebook links, ID cards, proof of disability/sickness/pay/unemployment. (Note: only mods would see this information. It would not be made public). * Improved streamlining of registrations and gift register. * Limit the number of subs that someone can request in. * Users who only request items on reddit will not be allowed to request in RAOC. * Better information regarding how many gifts have been received by each requestor. Full disclosure will be required in posts. * Amazon wishlists will be limited to 1 page per child with only one expensive item per list. This allows children to list their "dream" toy while also keeping a list of realistic items for Santas. * Items on the wishlist must be priced ~$30 or less, with the exception of the one big item. * Formulated layouts for requests that all users must use. * Perhaps not allowing reposts at all and instead keeping a master list, with a link to each request an a running gift tally. * Users who do not thank their Santas will not be welcome to participate here in future years. We already have rules in place regarding the deletion of posts, number and frequency of request posts, adult wishlists, etc - we hope to better enforce those rules next year. As our sub grows, it becomes necessary for mods to be a bit more rigid in the rules and more firm in the application of said rules. We want everyone to have a great experience here and to have a lovely holiday season, but we can only do that if we hold everyone accountable.  #160; ___________  #160; **Santas:** Please let us know which users have not yet thanked you for gifts. Also, we have created a new private sub just for you guys - this will be a place for you all to discuss ideas, concerns, etc for next year in RAOC. Please message the mods with proof that you are a Santa and we will add you to the new subreddit. **Requestors:** Please ensure that you thank your Santas and also please let us know if any gifts were not received. **Everyone:** please read these proposed rules above and discuss all of this in the comment section. We are paying attention and considering everything that is said. We need your input to make this sub a better place and we want to make sure that all rules are fair and realistic.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Low-Elo Shaming</TITLE>
    <DATE>2015-06-06 01:24:05</DATE>
    <TEXT>The mod team has been discussing a potential new rule this evening and we would love your input. From time to time, people post videos of low-elo games. Often times, the entire purpose of the post is to name and shame the individual who made a bad play and laugh at them. Occasionally, this can lead to in-game harassment. So, should we allow videos of bad plays from low-elo when the intention is to laugh at the player? If we do not allow low-elo shaming, then how can we fairly enforce the rule without seriously restricting other content? And, what exactly constitutes "low-elo"? (Bronze, silver, gold, plat, etc - where do we draw the line?) Two ideas that the mod team has discussed: * Disallow submissions whose intent is solely to name and shame a player. (In theory, this would mean that instead of a title like "noob lee sin fucks up", the submission would be framed as "awesome outplay on lee sin".) In this way, the focus is shifted to the positives of the play rather than the negatives of the mistake. * Require that the igns be blurred or removed from the video. Thoughts? Ideas? Concerns?</TEXT>

Here are some photos from our events. We wrote guides on how to do such events, created unique LoL-cocktails and did massive LoL parties during gamescom over the years. So far, we #8217;ve just been a side-event but now we want to open our own, dedicated eSports bar as a part of the MELTDOWN network. A place where you can meet people alike every day, play with and against each other and watch live games together. We started a crowdfunding some weeks ago which ends in less than 48 hours. So far we've gathered over 16.000 Euros. All information can be found on http://gamingbar-koeln.com. If you want to support our project you can donate something. You can also help us immensely just by sharing our site. Thank you all, I hope you have a great day :) Andy  #160; Reason: Crowd-funding.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>[Link to submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/3lhy3g/just_lost_a_game_because_the_enemy_jungler/) Body:  gt; I'm still stunned that this happened and now I'm honestly wondering why more people aren't doing this  amp; what the hell is the point of the "Gift Player" option on the post game screen?  gt; Had a game where I won lane, helped snowball bottom, and proceeded to take several towers across the map, leaving the enemy team with only inhib towers by the 15 minute mark or so. At around this time, the Vi says in all chat that she's in her promos to get into Platinum and promises that if someone purposely throws the game, she will gift that person a skin of their choice in the post game chat.  gt; My bot lane and I tell her to get real cause that's a really sad thing to do. My Singed on the other hand decided to walk 1 v 5 into the enemy team and die a few times to get the ball rolling. He then refuses to group but doesn't really push (just takes jungle creeps or pushes a lane halfway then doesn't really try to go for the inhib tower). He then says he would like the new Master Yi skin.  gt; At this point I'm stunned that this is even happening and I inform him (while still in All chat) that you can't receive gifts unless someone has been on your friend's list for a week and by then the Vi could easily just delete him. He then says in all chat that I'm flaming him/report me. The Vi says he can gift my Singed via the "Gift Player" option.  gt; Game ends. We end up losing. He gets the new Master Yi skin (supposedly) and I'm confused as to why the hell this happened or why it's even a thing.  gt; This post will probably get swept under the rug but I usually defend the community in this game saying they're not all that bad but this game actually has made me sick.

    <TITLE>Zyra is Thematically On-Point but Weaker Overall with Patch 6.9</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-05-07 00:12:03</DATE>
    <TEXT>As a Zyra main, I have some really mixed feelings about the rework. In some respects, I think Riot nailed the idea of her being part of a sprawling garden, but hurt her strengths in the process. Here are the main issues: The passive is underwhelming and problematic since the seeds spawn in seemingly random places. It feels very similar to the Illaoi tentacles. The biggest problem though, is that the spawned plants last for HALF the time of her old plants. Suggestion: make the plant timer decrease based on the number of plants spawned. 5 seconds for 1 or 2 plants, 2.5 seconds for anything more. In addition to the nerf on the plant timers, the plants also do less damage -- understandable since you can spawn so many. Again, I think scaling damage for the plants would make sense here too. Overall, Zyra seems weaker in mid and support. She also seems more annoying to play against if she manages to proc multiple seeds...which goes against the framework that Riot has been working on. She's like a cross between Illaoi's tentacles and Heimerdinger harass. **TL;DR Riot wants to reward players for growing a garden when skirmishing rather than having single plants. However, when your passive spawns seeds all over the place, it makes it really hard to have the control to capitalize on that.**</TEXT>

    <TITLE>State of the subreddit and the Orlando Shooting</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-06-13 00:03:38</DATE>
    <TEXT>We've heard your feedback on how today's events were handled. So here's the rundown of why certain actions were taken and what we intend to do to rectify the situation: /r/news was brigaded by multiple subreddits shortly after the news broke. This resulted in threads being filled with hate speech, vitriol, and vote manipulation. [See admin comment about brigades.](http://i.imgur.com/Aj5WKw6.png) We did a poor job reacting to the brigades and ultimately chose to lock several threads and then consolidate other big threads into a megathread. Brigades are still underway and there is still a lot of hate speech prevalent in the threads. However, we're going to take the following steps to address user concerns: 1. This is the meta thread where you can leave any feedback for our team. Some mods will be in the comments doing their best to answer questions. 2. We are allowing new articles as long as they contain new information. Our rules have always been to remove duplicates. We have also unlocked previously locked threads. 3. We have removed many of the comment filters that were causing comments to be incorrectly removed. We'll still be patrolling the comment sections looking for hate speech and personal information. 4. We are also aware that at least one moderator on the team behaved poorly when responding to users. Our team does not condone that behavior and we'll be discussing it after things in the subreddit calm down. We want to first deal with things that are directly impacting user experience. For the time being, we have asked the mod(s) involved to refrain from responding to any more comments. While we understand that there is a lot of disdain for our mod team right now, please try to keep your messages and comments civil. We are only human after all. **Update: The mod mentioned in point #4 (/u/suspiciousspecialist) is no longer on the /r/news mod team.** **Update 2:** Multiple people have raised concerns about /u/suspiciousspecialist and how a 4month old account was able to be a moderator in /r/news. Here is the response from /u/kylde:  gt; Ok. /u/suspiciousspecialist was originally a long-time /news moderator, who left of his own accord when he got a new job. This was 11 months ago. He left with an open invitation to rejoin the /news team at any time. So, eventually he returned as /u/suspiciousspecialist, verified his identity to our satisfaction, and was welcomed back to the team 4 months ago. Nothing sinister, nothing clandestine, simply an old team-mate rejoining the team, experienced mods are always a boon in large subreddits. **Update 3:** [Spez's statement about censorship](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4ny59k/lets_talk_about_orlando/): "A few posts were removed incorrectly, which have now been restored. One moderator did cross the line with their behavior, and is no longer a part of the team. We have seen the accusations of censorship. We have investigated, and beyond the posts that are now restored, have not found evidence to support these claims."</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Visiting Japan for 2 weeks - Need advice!</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-10-21 22:04:41</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm planning a 2 week trip to Japan with the most likely timeframe being end of January or sometime in February (with only a slight possibility of early March). Would love some advice re the following: 1. When would be the best to visit? 2. Are there any festivals or events happening in the Jan - early March timeframe that are worth doing/seeing? 3. I'm currently thinking that I'd like to spend the majority of my time in Kyoto (or at least use it as a hub for visiting other areas). So, what are the things I should definitely do/see while in Kyoto? 4. Two weeks is a decent chunk of time, is there anything else I should do or see while in Japan that isn't going to be super expensive and is reasonable to get to from Kyoto? 5. Whenever I travel, I try to go to a local "diamond in the rough" spot (like Dahab in Egypt). Any recommendations? Thanks for the help!</TEXT>

If not, I'd love to hear how you have adjusted given the nerfs. Right now, I'm just not seeing how she is viable there given all her counters, the long cds, and the most recent nerf.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Redesign discourages traffic to subreddits</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-12-05 19:18:15</DATE>
    <TEXT>Just checked out the new redesign, and I have two concerns: (1) Submissions on the front page now pop out, which is nice for the casual browser since you can easily remain on the front page. However, I think it could really harm subreddits since it will discourage people to go to the subreddit. Some impacts I foresee: * Traffic will be significantly lower resulting in less voting (even less than we have now) in the new queue. * It will be easier for spammers or people with an agenda to give their post traction with so few people actively in the new queues. * Subreddit activity will likely decrease significantly, especially in small subreddits. While a front page post will still see a lot of interaction, I doubt that other compelling posts in a subreddit will see the same sort of interaction. * Essentially, this feature will keep most people on the front page rather than encouraging them to interact in a subreddit as a community. * Reddit is, at its core, supposed to be a conglomeration of lots of small communities. This change seems to push it more towards one big RSS feed. (2) The experience on desktop sucks. It's very narrow and feels like you are browsing on mobile.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Ranked Placements Megathread</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-01-19 19:25:26</DATE>
    <TEXT>On January 16, the new ranked season began, and already we've seen thread after thread of people needing emotional support as they begin their climb...or fall (if you play yasuo). We have licensed therapists who will be browsing comments and offering clinical support to the worst affected by the broken and utterly **unfair** queues. ^^Not ^^really. If you somehow were blessed by the gods, then share your success and maybe offer some pointers to the lowly plebs. Let the gloating and bitching commence.  #160; *From the shadows, a lone mod yells: "NO! I REFUSE TO LISTEN TO THE TRIFLINGS OF PLEBS WHO STILL PLAY RANKED." He weeps.* ________  #160; This thread has started to fill up, so we have changed the suggested sort to "new" so everyone can share their placements with each other. If you would like to view the comments by "best" instead, you can change the suggested sort manually or [click here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/7rkcwi/ranked_placements_megathread/?sort=confidence)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Update to the title rule: Meme titles no longer allowed.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-01-22 16:35:55</DATE>
    <TEXT>Roughly 1 year ago, our enforcement changed to become more lenient on memes in titles. It's snowballed and we've been seeing an increasing number of vague titles that use memes as key descriptors (looking at you 200IQ play). Ultimately, our team has decided to completely disallow memes in titles. We discussed allowing some that accurately described the content of a post, but a major concern was that it would result in wildly inconsistent moderation. Starting today, our team will disallow all submissions with memes in the title. [The title rule](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/wiki/subredditrules#wiki_titles_require_context) has been updated to reflect the change and two bullets within the rule have been adjusted: **Old:**  gt; * Submission titles that are vague, contain no context, or do not accurately represent a major part of the submission content will be removed.  gt; * When making a title for a discussion topic, state what you're talking about directly. Posts with titles that start with phrases akin to "Does anyone else think" and other similar phrases will be removed. **New:**  gt; * Vague, contextless, memetic, or inaccurate titles are not allowed. Titles should represent or describe the content of a post.  gt; * Posts with titles that start with statements such as "Does anyone else think" and other similar phrases will be removed. And that's it. Please share any feedback you have or hit us up with your questions or concerns in the comments. I'll be floating in and out of the thread today and will do my best to respond.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Read this comment. You will be permanently banned without warning if you do not follow these three very crucial rules. * **DO NOT** post about police movements. In other words, if you are listening to scanners and radio communications of emergency personnel, hold off on sharing the play by plays. * **DO NOT** share the personal information of alleged suspects or victims until the identities are confirmed by the police or mainstream media. * **DO NOT** post identifiable images/videos of the dead or dying. Reddit is one of the most high-traffic sites in the world, especially in times of crisis. No one should find out that their loved one has died in a reddit thread. To clarify, you can still post images and videos of the incident, just no closeups of someone's face as they die. Edit: The shooter's name is now public. Please do not share the personal details of the shooter's family members (things like addresses, emails, phone numbers, etc will all still be removed). You still cannot name or share personal information of victims.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For a few reasons: 1. Live scenes are often chaotic and scanners can have conflicting information being reported from people on the scene. By using official police statements or media reports, we can be certain that the information is correct and most importantly, confirmed. 2. We don't want to encourage users to listen into the scanners to reap karma. In the past, listening to and reporting scanner information has led to major issues (Boston bomber comes to mind).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This megathread will serve as a location for active discussion about the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. **Comments have been set to new so that people can discuss developments in real time.**  #160; [The original thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/7xkstl/shooting_at_south_florida_high_school/) is still live and will remain up. However, it has nearly 30,000 comments and is pretty hard to use for active discussion. __________ **Here are the basic facts:** * 17 confirmed dead. 3 in critical condition at the hospital. * Suspect is in custody and has been named. * Shooter is cooperating with police and said that he pulled fire alarm. * This looks to be pre-meditated. Shooter had an AR-15 with multiple magazines and smoke grenades. He pulled the fire alarm at the end of the school day and began his rampage. There are a lot of other details out there, but these are just the basics. ___________ Remember, we have three very important rules for situations like these. If you do not abide by them, you will be permanently banned. * **DO NOT** share the personal information of victims until the identities are confirmed by the police or mainstream media. * **DO NOT** post identifiable images/videos of the dead or dying. Reddit is one of the most high-traffic sites in the world, especially in times of crisis. No one should find out that their loved one has died in a reddit thread. To clarify, you can still post images and videos of the incident, just no closeups of someone's face as they die. Since the shooter's name is now public, you can share his name, but do not share the personal details of the shooter's family members (things like addresses, emails, phone numbers, etc will all still be removed).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So the title here isn't the best...blame the outlet and not OP. **This happened at Jackson Middle School in Ohio.** It did not happen in Mississippi.  #160; It looks like the outlet used MS as an abbreviation for middle school when they first published the article and it has since been updated. Unfortunately, the OP cannot edit the title, nor can we. I've flaired the submission to try to make it even more obvious for people browsing the sub.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Guys....just because the title says "kill the NRA" does not mean that the article is [threatening violence.](https://imgur.com/a/NPbPc) Also, we don't want to lock this thread, so do us a favor and report any comments that violate our rules. Things like hate speech, threats of violence, personal attacks, etc are all not allowed. Have fun!  #160; Edit in response to some of the replies to this comment: Even if the billboard said "Kill NRA Members", which it does not, it is a news story. The article title is not threatening anyone, rather it is reporting on an event. It's amazing that this needs to be explained....  #160; Edit 2: Thread has been locked due to the sheer amount of vitriol, hate speech, and outright death threats that people are making towards one another.

    <TEXT>It's an article title. It is not a user making a comment that says "kill NRA members". Why is this so difficult to understand? An article title reports on the event at hand. That is what this article does. The article title is not threatening you or anyone else. Wtf world is this that people do not understand the difference?</TEXT>

They are talking about shit. Literal shit. They are not talking about the game, training, or any aspect of league. It is a clear violation of our relevancy rule. If they were talking about the game, the team, or some other aspect of league, it would likely be allowed. This is no different than how we treat videos of pros doing unrelated things.

    <TEXT>Honestly, I don't know. I've been away for a good chunk of the last two weeks due to irl things. My personal view is that it isn't relevant because while it's a mic check, they are mostly meming and there is little to no audio content that is relevant to the game. But it looks like the mods who were online at the time felt it was. Unsure what the consensus would be if I re-raised it now. For the submission in this removal thread though, the team was very much aligned on it being irrelevant. We're a big team with people from all over the world and while we aim for consistency, it doesn't always happen. Edit: I believe this is [the submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/84f27z/technical_difficulties_cloud9_comic_comms/) that /u/fml420xd is referring to.</TEXT>

Many approvals/removals are done by the first mod who sees it. Reported front page posts get more discussion, but can often be resolved by just 2-3 mods. We have ~30 mods on the team and we all discuss/work on policy together. We also have people whose job it is to go through and review mod actions to look for inconsistencies so we can correct them. We make mistakes and those can be very visible. But we also get a lot right and you guys don't see those because it's all done in the background. In a given month, our team will do more than 50,000 mod actions.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>When Duo becomes Solo</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-03-23 16:51:30</DATE>
    <TEXT>**Permalink:** /r/leagueoflegends/comments/86igik **Body:**  gt; Well..this is goin to be a small story that I feel I just need to share because it just happened to me. Not sure really what to think, because it was something so stupid that ended the start of a really good friendship, and there is nothing that I can do.  gt; To begin, I met this guy during solo que. Let's call him Jerry. Me and Jerry played a lot over the past few weeks, and it was really awesome. We were on discord, we chilled, we had tons of fun in games, even when one of us was triggered from our team not being that great, we were able to just bounce into the next game and have a blast. Jerry was shaping up to be a great online friend of mine. We would talk on dis and play a TON of games together, talk about personal lives, and we really got to know each other just in the week or 2 that we've met. Well...today, I guess League FINALLY came out with a voice chat system. Not knowing this, I ended up getting into a lobby, talking to Jerry beforehand and we agreed to play together. Shortly after he joins, I get on discord, and I'm waiting in my voice channel for him to join in. I start hearing something in the background, and I start to investigate to figure out where the noise was coming from. Before I realized what was going on, I kinda figured out what the noise was from the obvious moans and dirty talk. I check discord, no one in my channel, I open my browser to see if maybe there was a stupid ad about that kinda stuff, nothing. Finally, I open league (which was minimized at the time) and realized that both of us were in a voice channel, and he was doing something personal.  gt; After understanding the situation, I realized that he also just figured out what was going on. I quickly tried to brush it off by saying "I'm not sure if you know this man, but league has a voice channel now! For some reason xD. I had no idea, but whenever you're ready let me know and we can start!" I tried to just make it like it was no big deal, because honestly it isn't a big deal to me. So what, you were doing something 90% of the population does...but it was too late...  gt; The moment he figured out what was going on, he leaves the party. He disappears from my friends list. I am unable to message him on discord because his name is no longer there, I was blocked. Something so trivial ended a great short term friendship. I tried to message his other Discord account, but I'm not sure if he'll ever read it, or even try to deal with the embarrassment that he went through in that very brief moment. For those curious, I will post the message below that I sent him.  gt; To end, Jerry, it was amazing playing with you and learning about you as a person. You were a great friend, great duo partner, and I'm glad that I got the chance to meet you. I'm sorry that this happened, and I hope the future looks up for you, man.  gt; Much love, CynicalSilas.  gt; The message: Yo. So it's pretty clear that you deleted me, and that's fine if you don't want to be friends anymore because of that. I'm okay with it, but I wanted to say man...it was nice playing with you while we were friends. I'm sorry that that happened the way it did, I was completely unaware League had a voice channel now, and it's okay to be embarrassed, but man, you're a guy, and guys jerk off, I'm not judging, nor do I really care that you do. It was real nice meeting you, and I hope things go well and your climb is great. If you ever feel as if you want to readd me, I'll be here. Otherwise, have a good life, and good luck in your future ventures man. Sad to see ya go, though =(..much love, CynicalSilas.  gt; TL;DR - I lost a friend today because of something really silly, but I understand why he was embarrassed, it was a very personal thing that I accidentally became a part of, and I wish you the best, Jerry.  gt; Thanks for listening.  gt; Edit: Wow, I've never had this many comments on anything before. Filtering through and replying to them has been a bit of a challenge. Thanks to everyone for reading this, from the funny joke comments down to the serious condolences for the loss of a friend. Truly was a ride for the last hours!  gt; Edit: First off, holy shit this is the first time I've ever hit a front page of any reddit. Mostly don't post, just comment on various things. Thank you everyone for the comments. It's been a ride! Secondly, I wanted to address one thing that is constantly being commented on here in the way of "Why didn't you just leave voice chat" or "Why didn't you just act like you weren't there." In short, I couldn't. It took me about 30-45s to realize the sound of the porn was coming from League voice chat, and when I finally realized, he already knew I was hearing it. I had said "What the fuck is this..?" as soon as I started to hear the porn, and it was over from that point. Didn't even really get to say much, he had left as soon as I typed what was stated in the message above. **Rule violation(s):** * irrelevant edits **Reports:** [Lots.](https://i.imgur.com/9eJJkKc.png) --- ^Note: ^Front ^page ^removals ^are ^never ^made ^by ^a ^single ^mod. ^This ^post ^was ^created ^to ^provide ^a ^place ^for ^discussion ^specific ^to ^this ^removal. ^If ^you ^want ^to ^discuss ^another ^thread ^removal ^or ^changing ^the ^rules, ^please ^make ^a ^separate ^post.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have never been supportive of a filter system because it essentially creates false positives. Users filter out content they don't want to see instead of downvoting it. While this is nice for people who use the subreddit often, it can lead to a terrible experience for a casual user. Our job is to make sure the subreddit is accessible to everyone and reflective of the community as a whole. Enabling filters kneecaps both of those goals. That said, we are a team and there may come a day when a sufficient number of people on the team feel that filters would be a good move. Right now, I'm not sure there is enough support for it...</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The rule is applied most stringently to submissions. That does not mean that comments can go cart blanche and say whatever they want. People should report them, and we will review them. The fact of the matter is that the vast majority of these sorts of things go unreported. That said, comments are generally not held to quite the same standard as a submission when it comes to evidence. There are two main reasons for this: 1. Comments are not as visible as a submission. 2. People can reply to comments in the same chain with a direct retort or additional information that may either invalidate the assertion or result in sufficient evidence. We remove comments that make personal attacks. We also remove unsubstantiated comments that could lead to severe real life implications for someone. But there is a grey line with comments that doesn't really exist for submissions, in that Reddit functions primarily to allow open discussion. People can and do comment with opinions, conspiracy theories, and blanket statements that may not always be based in fact. We do not want to curtail speech, even if it is misguided.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I wouldn't say it isn't for you. Content changes all the time. During LCS, there tends to be a lot more esports content and when the matches aren't happening, there tends to be a lot more related to patch notes, items, champions, fan art, etc. That's what makes the subreddit great. Depending on the hour, the day, or week, you get a wide variety of content. As far as other subreddits, I'm not too sure where to point you. There is /r/summonerschool if you want to get tips and tricks, various champion main subreddits if you want to chat about a specific champ, rule34 if you are into that sort of stuff. But I don't know of any other broad and large league related subreddit.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I understand that Reddit is doing this to make the site more accessible to new users especially since their central focus is growth, not revenue. I support it because I want reddit to grow. However, as a longtime user, I prefer the old reddit. I like its simplicity and I like that the old version encourages more direct engagement with subreddits as communities. The new version seems to prioritize the front page as a news feed (ala Facebook) by making things into pop-outs, rather than sending people to the actual subreddits. I worry that this will lead to the loss of distinct subreddit identities and move towards just another generic newsfeed with a comment section. So yeah...I have real concerns about the new design that I hope are addressed. But I also do genuinely prefer the old version and would love to see it left available for users who do like it better.</TEXT>

In the interview he says:  gt; The incentive structure is simply growth at all costs. There was never, in any board meeting that I have ever attended, a conversation about the users, about things that were going on that were bad, about potential dangers, about decisions that might affect potential dangers. There was never a conversation about that stuff. And a little further down he says:  gt; From the inside, I can tell you that the board is never asking about revenue. They honestly don #8217;t care, and they said as much. They #8217;re only asking about growth. They believe that if they have a billion unique visitors a month, that they have a property that is going to be worth a ton of money in some way eventually. They really do look at it in that abstract way.  gt; I know they #8217;re making a lot of strides on the advertising side. But I guarantee, that is not their focus.

    <TITLE>Redesign hurts Reddit's core identity</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-05-02 16:46:28</DATE>
    <TEXT>Reddit is unique because it (1) allows users to be anonymous, and (2) has very defined subreddit communities that make up the site. While the redesign has not yet threatened that first item, it seems to be moving towards becoming a Facebook newsfeed by de-emphasizing subreddits. Submissions on the front page pop out, which is nice for the casual browser since you can easily remain on the front page. However, it no longer pushes users to subreddits where they can browse other submissions and get a feel for the community as a whole. As a result, traffic will be significantly lower resulting in major issues for subreddits, like: * Less voting (even less than we have now) in the new queue. * Spammers or people with an agenda having more power to push their posts to the top because of that drop in traffic. * Subreddit activity will likely decrease significantly, especially in small subreddits. While a front page post will still see a lot of interaction, I doubt that other compelling posts in a subreddit will see the same sort of interaction. Essentially, this feature will keep most people on the front page rather than encouraging them to interact in a subreddit as a community. _______ I totally understand the desire to make reddit more accessible to new users. However, the redesign thus far seems more focused on becoming another Facebook. Chats and subreddit chats are being implemented, user profiles, a more streamlined news feed that deemphasizes subreddits, etc. All of these changes move reddit away from its core identity and are alienating users who have been on the site for years.</TEXT>

Additionally, admins are implementing that feature and expecting moderators to moderate it.

    <TEXT>[Read this comment thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/8g22a6/subreddit_chat_rooms_beta_has_been_released_to/dy88d3f/) to understand why the subreddit chat is a terrible idea and a slap in the face of mods. It doesn't matter if we can just not use it. It matters that we send super serious tickets into Reddit admins and it takes days to get a reply. Just a few weeks ago, a mod on the news team received death threats from a guy who knew where he lived and said he was going to kill him, his family, and throw their bodies in a lake nearby. He was able to name locations and people. It was alarming enough that not only did we give it to the admins, we also reported it to the police. It took nearly a week to hear back from the admins and all they said was "we have reviewed this matter". That is not good enough.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; You don't have to be redirected to the sub. The redesign gives the users more opportunities to subscribe to the subreddit by putting that information front and center. What you seem to be missing is that people are no longer actually sent to the subreddit. They sit on the front page. Yes, they might subscribe, but they aren't actually interacting on the subreddit itself.  gt; You haven't given an actual reason why you think the new queue or voting in general would be lower. There's nothing about the redesign that deemphasizes voting. Yes, I have. The fact that people are no longer being pushed to subreddits via the homepage means that we will see even fewer people in the new queue. Spammers who understand how reddit works will therefore have an easier time getting their content to artificially rise.  gt; This feels like another baseless claim. Honestly, it feels like you just fundamentally misunderstand the argument I am making. The redesign, especially with regards to the homepage, means that people stay on the homepage instead of going to subreddits. Subreddits are a defining element of reddit. New users will now be interacting with their "home feed" more than they will be interacting with subreddits themselves as distinct entities because they are never actually redirected. They instead have a pop-out that allows them to stay in one place. It de-emphasizes subreddit communities in favor of a Facebook newsfeed.</TEXT>

If we, as mods, struggle to make decisions on submissions on an almost daily basis, I think it probably could use some fine tuning.

    <DATE>2018-05-27 16:36:11</DATE>
    <TEXT>**Permalink:** /r/leagueoflegends/comments/8mgn5r **Body:**  gt;It is important that this Voice line would not trigger on snap cast, as knocking up a thot only makes them harder to remove and strengthens their power. That is how thots win. And at that close range Evelynn can still ult back and deal damage and thus the thot is not gone.  gt;I have given much thought about this thot issue, and concluded even a mostly charged ult can #8217;t ensure thotimus prime is indeed gone. Evelynn is league #8217;s trickiest thot, and if you knock her back just a bit she will just stealth, heal, and reposition to try again. Only poppy #8217;s max ult can purify the land of her thotiness. **Rule violation(s):** * Sexist + a meme **Reports:** * 7: This is spam * 6: Not relevant to League of Legends * 2: Threatening, harassing, or inciting violence * 2: Specific restricted content (see rules for list) * 1: Misogyny * 1: Dumbass shit * 1: ban memes * 1: Low effort shit post.

    <TEXT>Hi Everyone, It's been a rough week. If you or someone you know is suicidal, please seek help. Here are some resources:  #160; **Worldwide Directories** We know of two international lists that are maintained by reputable agencies: * [The International Association for Suicide Prevention maintains a **Global Crisis Centre Directory**.](https://www.iasp.info/resources/Crisis_Centres/). * [The Befrienders](http://www.befrienders.org/need-to-talk) maintain a hotline database; use the "Find a Helpline by Country" control at the top of their page. Do be aware that there are a lot of online global hotline lists maintained privately by members of the public. Although these people usually mean well, the information on their sites is often outdated or incorrect. ****  #160; **United States** * [National Suicide Prevention Lifeline](http://www.suicidepreventionlifeline.org/): 1-800-273-8255 (TALK) Veterans press 1 to reach specialised support. (The older number, 1-800-SUICIDE, is no longer published by the lifeline agency and will probably stop working in the near future.) * Online Chat: http://chat.suicidepreventionlifeline.org/GetHelp/LifelineChat.aspx * [Crisis Text Line](http://www.crisistextline.org/get-help-now/): Text "START" to 741-741 * Youth-Specific services (voice/text/chat/email) from the Boys' Town National Hotline: http://www.yourlifeyourvoice.org/Pages/ways-to-get-help.aspx * Spanish: 1-800-SUICIDA _________  #160; **Unsure if you should reach out to a hotline?** If you are worried about reaching out through these hotlines for any reason, then please check out this [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SWResources/comments/1c7ntr/suicide_hotline_faqs/) which may address some of your concerns. _________  #160; The above information comes from our friends over at /r/suicidewatch who maintain an [excellent resource page](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/hotlines) that contains hotline numbers, chat lines, and more for countries around the world. /r/suicidewatch exists to provide help to redditors who are having a rough time and is not a place to discuss celebrity deaths. If you go there to offer help, **read their rules** because they have extremely strict guidelines.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2018-06-16 20:36:39</DATE>
    <TEXT>**Permalink:** /r/leagueoflegends/comments/8rizth **Body:**  gt; Just won a game where my computer turned off at the begining, after 7-8 minutes I come back, and not only win the game, but get most damage with velkoz support http://euw.op.gg/summoner/userName=hispace100 (which wasn't hard considering we had a first time heimerdinger in the botlane) and which is my prize? You guess it right, -19 LP and 5 games in low priority queue.  gt; So my question is... Why? If someone afk for a few minutes because something happens, they come back, and win the game, why should they be punished? Next time something like this happens I'll consider if losing 30 extra minutes of my life to lose LP no matter how I play is worth it or not...  gt; EDIT: The thing is, that if someone wants to go AFK, they could stay in base moving from time to time, and if their team wins, they'll get LP, but if you get disconnected and come back in 2-3 mins, you will still be penalyzed, thats what I think that makes 0 sense. **Rule violation(s):** * Address rule.

    <TEXT>Just from a philosophical perspective, one of the negative impacts of things like Facebook's newsfeed is that it allows people to only see the news and information they WANT to see. It is one of the reasons that so many people live in bubbles these days and why conservatives and liberals have such fundamentally different realities. It's a problem that responsible media sites should be looking to solve. While I hear the concerns about Reddit's own user bias due to upvotes, I think it would be far worse for people to simply self select their news. The bubble would just be worse than ever...for people on both sides.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So beyond the relevance factor, if you watch the video there is no real evidence that Singed420 intends any sort of self-harm. The OP is reading **a lot** into the words that are said. Yes, singed420 looks a bit upset, but no more upset than anyone else who is having a bad day. The post is pretty hyperbolic and based on extremely weak evidence.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think you are missing the point. The /r/leagueoflegends subreddit is not the proper place for people to seek assistance. I understand that people are worried about the guy, but the post itself doesn't contain adequate evidence to support that concern. Further, even if it did, the league subreddit is not the place to post about it. All it does is magnify singed420's personal issues, which most experts say is the **worst** thing you can do.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No. It was removed because the evidence in the post does not support the title. It's also not relevant in its current form. There are a lot of issues at hand. Even if the title was that this was singed420's last game ever, the evidence would be insufficient because all he said was that it was his "last game" and did not give a timeframe. For all we know, it's his last game of the day or of the weekend. Hence why I said that the post is hyperbolic and lacks evidence. Simply put, we don't have enough information to know what was going on.</TEXT>

The big difference is that our exception allows for things that **do** affect, not **could** affect.

    <TEXT>Quick reminder to everyone about commenting during major situations like this. * **DO NOT** post about police movements. In other words, if you are listening to scanners and radio communications of emergency personnel, hold off on sharing the play by plays. * **DO NOT** share the personal information of alleged suspects or victims until the identities are confirmed by the police or mainstream media. * **DO NOT** post identifiable images/videos of the dead or dying. Reddit is one of the most high-traffic sites in the world, especially in times of crisis. No one should find out that their loved one has died in a reddit thread. To clarify, you can still post images and videos of the incident, just no closeups of someone's face as they die.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm with you. I could care less about e-sports. It's not something I watch or enjoy. I prefer satire, champ info, patch notes, fan art, fan fiction, etc. However, filters are not an option right now. Reddit is rolling out a redesign that will impact css across the site. Additionally, current filters don't work for mobile users. It's a band-aid and not a viable solution. As for the spoiler rule, it's something we will be re-evaluating in a few weeks once we have more data to look at to see how it impacted the sub. Please continue to share your thoughts on it. We are actively considering everyone's feedback and I think your feedback here is extremely helpful. The res spoiler filter was something that I had not personally thought about when considering the spoiler rule.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Mueller is being smart here. He knows that Republicans and the Trump administration are running a massive propoganda campaign to convince the public that there was no collusion. So he's laying the groundwork to first prove that Russia interfered in our election. The next step will be proving whether or not the Trump campaign worked with them. If he had indicted Roger Stone or Trump Jr today for "collusion", the campaign to discredit those charges would be massive. But if he waits until after there is undeniable evidence/proof that the Russians actually interfered, it will be much harder to discredit those charges.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Everyone needs to pause for a second. Yes, it would be good to hear from the translator, but think about the precedent it would set. The argument from Lindsey Graham (R-SC) is that subpoenaing the translator would set a precedent of allowing Congress to subpoena translators and aides in the future and could erode trust with foreign leaders. I'm all for transparency, but I think that argument is solid. Imagine if the Republicans could have subpoenaed every translator or aid from every meeting Obama had with foreign leaders.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>New Rule: No Gambling Sites</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-07-31 03:16:01</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi Everyone, The mod team has just updated our rule-set to include a new rule that **bans content from websites whose business is primarily gambling.** #So what does this mean: Unikrn, eSportbet.com, draftkings, fanduel, and other similar sites whose primary business is gambling will no longer be allowed on the subreddit. #Why has this rule been implemented? We have a young user base and we already have rules in place relating to spam, direct advertising, nsfw content, etc which exist to (1) protect users, and (2) keep the subreddit appropriate for all ages. This change serves the same purpose since gambling is predatory in nature, opens users up to scams or addictive behavior, and is not even legal for users under 18. To be clear: the reason for this is because we don't want to host gambling on the subreddit. It is the gambling aspect of these sites, not the platform that is problematic.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This may seem sudden to a lot of people given the ridiculously fast paced news cycle in the Trump era, but this investigation has been going on since early 2017. [Politico wrote a great article in May 2017](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/05/14/congress-stock-trading-conflict-of-interest-rules-238033) about Collins and a half dozen other lawmakers who have major financial conflicts. ------ Here are a few highlights from the article: * **Senator Sheldon Whitehouse**, Democrat from Rhode Island, sits on the Senate HELP Committee, which oversees health care, is a heavy investor in pharmaceutical stocks. Last November, as lawmakers closed in on a bipartisan deal over a significant medical research bill called the 21st Century Cures Act, Whitehouse bought shares in the pharmaceutical firms McKesson, Gilead, and Abbott Labs 10 days before the bill was made public. Whitehouse and his wife bought additional stock in Gilead and Amgen on Nov. 28, two days before the House voted on the bill. The day President Barack Obama signed the bill into law, Whitehouse started a series of three sales of shares in those companies. * **Rep. Adam Kinzinger**, Republican of Illinois, was a guest speaker at Prescient Edge, a small research and technology firm with Defense Department contracts, in January of 2016. When the company raised private capital later that year, Kinzinger bought in to the tune of $20,002. Kinzinger is now a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, which oversees issues affecting Prescient Edge. * **Rep. Chuck Fleischmann**, Republican of Tennessee, sits on the health care appropriations panel. As Vice President Joe Biden was pressing lawmakers to approve funding for his  #8220;Cancer Moonshot #8221; proposal in the summer of 2016, a Fleischmann family account invested in two companies, Juno Therapeutics and Celgene, which were developing new cancer drugs. One of the investments was made a week before the Obama administration announced new measures that would speed up approval for cancer therapies. * **Conaway**, the Texas Republican , who is a House deputy majority whip, introduced a bill in late 2015 that would pave the way for an area nuclear waste storage facility in his district. The following spring, the storage facility #8217;s owner applied to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for approval to open. Within days, an account owned by Conaway's wife bought stock in a nuclear power company that operated in states surrounding Texas and stood to benefit from a nearby storage facility. * **Sen. Bob Corker**, Republican of Tennessee, was an original cosponsor of a bill to eliminate the oil export ban in 2015. He bought shares in Chesapeake Energy, which was part of a coalition of companies pushing for an end to the ban, in the months leading up to Congress passing the energy-friendly legislation. The day after it was announced that the ban would be included in a piece of must-pass legislation, Corker sold at least $500,001 of the stock in Chesapeake.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The 2008 financial crisis changed that. In the lead-up to the market crash, members of Congress were using insider information to sell off stocks before they nosedived. After public outrage, Congress passed the [STOCK Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STOCK_Act) which President Obama signed into law in 2012. However, Congress quickly weakened the law in 2013 after public pressure had subsided.</TEXT>

Yesterday, we made it clear that the post was relevant and would be allowed, and we did everything in our power to keep the thread unlocked to allow discussion. We did not VM the post. A person directly affiliated with the article did, and as such it was removed. This isn't even a grey area. It's black and white. Depending on where you stand on this removal, you may view it as a good thing that we did not know about the VM until this evening, because the post already had all of the visibility and discussion it was going to get.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Kadexe is right that this post is allowed and within our rules. Our team recently discussed posts that focus on the subreddit community and a majority of the team decided that those posts are not meta and should be allowed. A majority of the team felt that meta only means things like css, rules, enforcement, and other things relating to the mod team, moderation, and mechanics of the subreddit. I disagree, but I am in the minority. My view is that commentary on the subreddit community, past or future posts on the subreddit, etc would all be meta, but that discussion about the broader league community would not be. Mostly wanted to put this here to give some insight into how our team thinks about these things.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No. We have rules for a reason and we apply them as fairly as possible. We also rely on users to report rule-breaking submissions and comments, while also doing our best to manually spot them. Making an exception like this would breakdown how moderating works by incentivizing users to not report rule-breaking submissions. Furthermore, it opens the mod team up to even more abuse and allegations of "shilling" since we are no longer applying a ruleset equally across all submissions, but rather making exceptions. Users would have no idea if we simply noticed the submission too late OR if we chose to ignore that it was rule-breaking until it was too late, in order to allow it to stay up.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>**Permalink:** /r/leagueoflegends/comments/9cc0z5 **Body:**  gt; I #8217;m a minority and a woman, and I #8217;ve been playing since season 3. I am so fucking over all the outspoken Rioters on twitter and I don #8217;t understand how Riot doesn #8217;t have a better PR team yet.  gt; How is excluding men a good thing? Yes, women face discrimination in the industry. We just want to be equal. Despite what Daniel thinks, that doesn #8217;t mean pushing men down. We want to be raised up. Pushing men down just makes us feel like we #8217;ve been begging for a spot on the cool kids table, so admin decides to ban every cool kid so we finally get a seat. ITS NOT EQUALITY. It #8217;s especially disappointing that a woman that works for Riot does not understand this and chooses to condemn the community instead of her coworkers.  gt; Also, calling a minority (unsure if female) a sea lion in response to a perfectly polite and interesting tweet is fucked up, especially when you go on to retweet tweets about how minorities struggle so much against white men. Nice, I love someone who speaks for us while not even listening to us. I saw some amazing female responses in the reddit thread that appeared quite early but I guess we #8217;re all manbabies, right?  gt; It #8217;s super annoying to see a game I love die like this, at least Blizzard let their games die in peace. **Rule violation(s):** * Repost **Reports:** 4: Not relevant to League of Legends 2: Addressed to individuals or distinct entities 1: This is spam 1: Spam 1: Not related to League of Legends but to an event Riot is running separate from the game. 1: this doesn't contribute anything new to the conversation, its just repeating other posts 1: AS A WOMAN I ALSO HATE SJWS REEEE DAE FEEL LIKE ME?????????? 1: It's rude, vulgar or offensive 1: there's people with different opinions! damn this is amazing! 1: The only thing she wants is attention 1: repost --- ^Note: ^Front ^page ^removals ^are ^never ^made ^by ^a ^single ^mod. ^This ^post ^was ^created ^to ^provide ^a ^place ^for ^discussion ^specific ^to ^this ^removal. ^If ^you ^want ^to ^discuss ^another ^thread ^removal ^or ^changing ^the ^rules, ^please ^make ^a ^separate ^post.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Riot #8217;s Response to the PAX Situation Really Isn #8217;t Sitting Well With Me.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-09-02 18:26:31</DATE>
    <TEXT>**Permalink:** /r/leagueoflegends/comments/9ccazo **Body:**  gt;Riot #8217;s been in a lot of hot water recently and they #8217;re trying to distance themselves from the sexism that got them in trouble and show that they #8217;re not a bunch of frat boys and that they are an inclusive and equal work place. I get that.  gt; But condemning one sexist behavior with different sexist behavior at PAX is not the way to do it. I mean imagine if the situation was flipped and they didn #8217;t let women and non binaries into the event, or if they didn #8217;t let Black or Hispanic people into the event. The uproar would make national headlines and they would likely face lawsuits.  gt; But because they #8217;re excluding white men, sorry, man babies, it #8217;s ok? And they doubled down on that stance? I don #8217;t think that #8217;s the right approach. They #8217;re essentially condemning sexism with sexism to show how inclusive they are. Maybe the rest of reddit has a different opinion here, but their statement left a really bad taste in my mouth. **Rule violation(s):** * Repost of already front page posts. **Reports:** * 2: Not relevant to League of Legends * 1: This is spam * 1: None --- ^Note: ^Front ^page ^removals ^are ^never ^made ^by ^a ^single ^mod. ^This ^post ^was ^created ^to ^provide ^a ^place ^for ^discussion ^specific ^to ^this ^removal. ^If ^you ^want ^to ^discuss ^another ^thread ^removal ^or ^changing ^the ^rules, ^please ^make ^a ^separate ^post.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is a sitewide rule, not a subreddit rule. And we have a ton of mods. We have more mods than the /r/news team and 14 million fewer subscribers. We are unpaid volunteers and it is a holiday weekend...maybe you should cut us some slack. We want to enjoy Labor Day just like everyone else.</TEXT>
