    <DATE>2017-11-01 01:51:44</DATE>
    <TEXT>Morris has maintained significant connections here- he was an awesome OC and helped build the program along with Dabo. He also was instumental in the recruitment of Nuke Hopkins and Deshaun. I know his record at SMU has been less than stellar, but he has absolutely improved the program. Remember it took Dabo a few years until the record started showing real improvement. But he improved it, steadily, every year. I know AD #8217;s look for guys who came in and won a ton of games their first year- but imo it #8217;s about building a culture. That #8217;s what coaches like Saban and Dabo have done. Of course I #8217;m biased- but I think it would be a fantastic hire for Florida.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>After a full day of playing, the one drawback to Skyrim VR is that playing as a mage is far superior to any other class/build for a few reasons.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-11-18 04:32:48</DATE>
    <TEXT>Firstly, using a single handed sword or axe is kind of unsatisfying. You basically just waggle your controller/sword at the enemy and score hits. This is less of a problem with two handed weapons, where you land larger strokes more slowly. Second: The archery is AWESOME. Shooting a bow and arrow is so much fun that I kept running out of arrows as I shot every deer and rabbit that I can across. HOWEVER, with the move, there is a problem: you know that to strafe right or left (or back up) you point the left move in that direction. But the left move also controls the bow and its aiming. You can #8217;t strafe left or right and aim the bow at the same time. This is compounded by (let #8217;s face it) the silly fighting dynamics of Skyrim itself: when you meet an enemy, both of you just strafe dance around in circles like some gypsy dance. Therefore, the mage class is BY FAR the best way to play. The movement is easy, casting spells from (what feels like) your real hands is super satisfying, and the fact that you can cast different spells from both hands at different targets simultaneously makes you feel like a badass. Therefore, the mage gameplay is way better than other classses.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>HELP! This morning PSVR suddenly has EXTREME amount of drift. Literally by the time the Bethesda logo comes up, it is all skewed. Within 30 seconds of game play everything is so skewed it is unplayable.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-11-22 16:18:44</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've had the setup since PSVR came out, everything in the same place, with no problems. Literally played like 3 hours yesterday. Now suddenly it is drifting so bad that I can not play any game for more than 30 seconds without everything being so wonky that it is unplayable, and resetting screen position doesn't help. My hands are completely not where they are IRL, and to view the menu in Skyrim I literally have to look over my shoulder! I've tried literally everything: all of the adjustments in settings (camera, tracking lights etc) literally everyone. I even went as far as to put blankets on my window to make sure it was pitch dark, and even moved the camera to a whole new location. Shit I even thought maybe the PS moves were messed up so I tried playing with just dualshock. Nothing works. I'm wondering if the headset might be broken- like maybe an accelerometer is giving bad input or something **EDIT: FIXED!!!** **Thank you /u/Helcyin** The solution was to go to settings- initialization and restore all PS4 settings to default!</TEXT>

  <WRITING>
    <TITLE>Finally figured out a fix to severe drift in Skyrim without have to restore PS4 settings to default: Don't wear the headset or move it all an when starting Skyrim- keep the headset completely still on the floor or on a table until the game fully loads.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-11-24 16:46:48</DATE>
    <TEXT>You may have seen my post the other day where all of a sudden Skyrim had so much drift that within 30 seconds I literally had to look over my shoulder to see the menu (I have had the same setup since PSVR launched an never had this problem). Someone finally gave me a solution that worked instantly- reset the PS4 to all default settings. When it started happening again today and I found a quicker solution- keep the headset completely still until the game fully loads. I think somehow the slight movement of your head while the game is loading somehow throws off thee tracking (maybe the accelerometers?) Anyway, I did this and the problem was solved, been playing an hour now with no issues.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>When are we going to start talking about a huge and real threat to the 2nd amendment: cops often treat people in legal possession of a firearm as if they are about to commit mass murder- until proven otherwise.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-12-09 19:03:40</DATE>
    <TEXT>The video from Arizona is what got me on this ([video, NSFL, biased captions](https://youtu.be/Udz-lXgANMA)). Regardless of whether the cops were justified or not in shooting the man, the reality is this: dude was in legal possession of a rifle (an air rifle, no less). Someone walked by his room and saw the rifle through the window and called the police. Guy threatened no one, was in his room minding his own business, committed no crime at all. Next thing, SWAT officers kitted up like they are about to storm Fallujah have him on his knees with AR #8217;s pointed at him, treating him like some extremely dangerous criminal that is about to commit mass murder. Do I REALLY need to worry if an idiot neighbor walks by my house and looks through my window and sees me cleaning my rifle, she can call the police and report  #8220;a man with a gun #8221;? Resulting in SWAT officers at my door? This is literally why I stopped carrying a revolver in my car. Several years ago I was pulled over for speeding. The officer asked  #8220;Are there any weapons in the vehicle? #8221; And when I said  #8220;Yes, there is a revolver in the glove box. #8221; He immediately freaked out and drew his weapon, as if he is about to be shot at any moment, screaming at me to keep my hands on the wheel. I don #8217;t ever want to be in this situation again, where any movement can be misinterpreted and result in my death. I obviously see the other side of the equation: police need to take precautions to protect themselves and be safe. But I think the pendulum has swung WAY too far, that any encounter with police, if you possess a legal firearm, is extremely dangerous. I just don #8217;t think it #8217;s right that legally possessing a firearm should result in you immediately being treated like a criminal, with police shouting and pointing a weapon at you.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>She #8217;s always been a casual lover of games- from Mario on Game Cube to Animal Crossing to Phoenix Wright. But I have never seen her game as much as she has in the past 6 months on the Switch. For one thing, she beat Mario. I can #8217;t remember the last time (if ever) she stuck to a game long enough to beat it. Then she KEPT playing it for weeks to get moons. Now she has put EASILY 200 hours into Stardew Valley which is insane for someone that I would have categorized as a very casual gamer. Why? I think Nintendo REALLY hit on something special with the portability of the Switch. Just today, she has switched from TV to portable play at least three times when I used the TV to watch bowl games etc. And in a few hours she will take it to bed to get another hour or two in. The Switch is a game changer, I think it is (frankly) revolutionary.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So whether listening to pandora or Apple Music, the watch face changes to show the song and has the skip, rewind, and volume etc. But when I push those, it doesn #8217;t do anything. What am I doing wrong? EDIT: I #8217;m not sure if this is what fixed it, but  #8220;Now Playing #8221; by default was not in my dock. It would just appear on the watch automatically when I started listening to music. I added it to the dock, and it appears just like before but now the controls work.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Reminder that playing 60 minutes of SuperHot in VR burns approximately 275 calories which is the same as walking 3.5 miles.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-05-31 04:34:14</DATE>
    <TEXT>There haven't been studies about SuperHot in particular, but having practiced Tai Chi for years I feel qualified to compare the two and and extrapolate. In my experience playing SuperHot is just as much of a workout if not more. Granted, their are some differences in that some of the poses and motions in Tai Chi tax specific muscles, but as far as the aerobic and calorie burning they are very similar. So, again, to extrapolate: There are plenty of sources on the web that estimate the calories burned in Tai Chi. They vary a bit but the average estimate is that a 150lb person doing a 60 minute session burns 275 calories, which is the equivalent of walking 3.5 miles. I have little doubt that a 60 minute SuperHot session yields similar results. There are other VR games that are also great workouts, and some such as Holoball (IMO possibly the most underrated PSVR game) are more intense. But the bottom line that VR can be a fantastic tool to have fun while improving your fitness.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Just to illustrate how ignorant Trump is about German car manufacturers: The top exporter of American-made cars is not Ford, not GM, it's BMW. The third largest exporter? Mercedes. in fact, the majority of Mercedes sold in the US are built in the US.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-06-02 05:59:31</DATE>
    <TEXT>As you know, Trump has been talking shit about German car manufacturers for a while now, saying he "wants them to build cars here" and reportedly said he [wants to ban German cars](http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/390009-trump-to-impose-total-ban-on-luxury-german-cars-report) from the US. Trump is completely ignorant to the fact that German auto companies are ALREADY some of the leading car manufacturers in the U.S. The world's largest BMW plant is in South Carolina. By value, the largest exporter of American-built cars is not Ford, not General Motors, [it's BMW](https://www.greenvilleonline.com/story/money/2018/02/13/bmw-manufacturing-remains-leading-u-s-auto-exporter-despite-pros-2017-exports-decline-amid-overall-s/333490002/) Care to guess which company exports the third most cars? It's [Mercedes](http://www.thetruthaboutcars.com/2017/05/cars-german-auto-brands-sell-build-united-states-america/). Not only does Mercedes/Daimler build 282,000 cars annually in the U.S., not only do they export over $1 billion worth of cars from the U.S. each year, 51% of all Mercedes bought in the U.S. are [built in the U.S.](http://www.thetruthaboutcars.com/2017/05/cars-german-auto-brands-sell-build-united-states-america/).</TEXT>

    <TITLE>In all of modern history there has been a sense that technology and discoveries are changing the world. Did people in the Middle Ages have any such sentiment? Did they view technology as something that would affect their lives?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-06-06 02:56:32</DATE>
    <TEXT>I realize that it is inaccurate to think of the Middle Ages as a  #8220;dark #8221; time with no scientific or technological discoveries. But what I mean is, like for the past several hundred years it seems like there has been a sense that life as we know it is changing. In the 17th century, for example, explorers were discovering entire  #8220;new worlds #8221; and new cultures, and these sailors, merchants, and explorers were seen as blazing a new path that would change Europe forever. In more recent history the industrial and technological revolutions have produced such rapid change that pretty much everyone knows that the world in 50 years will be practically unrecognizable. But did the people in the Middle Ages see it that way, or did they view their way of life as  #8220;the way it has always been, and the way it will always be. #8221; Maybe the question is too nebulous, but I hope you see what I mean.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As well as the PSVR has sold (approaching 3 million units) that still only represents a fraction of the 74 million PS4s out there. Therefore, I can understand why some developers don #8217;t put a high priority on VR mode. That #8217;s why I personally would be OK with treating a quality VR mode as you would DLC. I mean, if the developers invest more money and resources to create the VR mode, it isn #8217;t unreasonable for them to expect a higher return for that. You *are* getting an expanded version of the game, after all.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>It #8217;s a real shame that very few game developers have taken advantage of the touch pad #8217;s capabilities on the DualShock 4. It has so much potential.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-06-18 07:55:49</DATE>
    <TEXT>When the PS4 launched with games like Killzone, I thought the touch pad would become an integral part of the control scheme on the PS4. Gestures on the pad (i.e. swiping left or right, or swiping up then left etc) could be bound to a myriad of functions which would allow the touchpad to be like having 10 extra buttons. I #8217;m playing Witcher 3 now do using that game as an example- rather than open the menu, scrolling right to  #8220;meditation #8221; and then moving the wheel to set how long to meditate then accepting it, they could map it where a swipe from top to bottom on the pad automatically makes you meditate for one hour without all the button clicks. Or, for signs, rather than have to open up the menu with R1, then rotate to the sign you want equipped it could instead be: swiping diagonally from bottom right to top left switches to Quen, from the bottom left to top right switches to Aard etc. There is *so much* potential there. But sadly, the touch pad has become little more than an jumbo sized button.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The game is very well made, well polished, and looks gorgeous. The level design is excellent with a well-thought out learning curve. Playing couch co-op (meaning with someone sitting next to you IRL) is an absolute blast. It really rewards you for good teamwork and the puzzles IMO are really fun to figure out together by brainstorming. $20 is a great value. If you are looking for a game that you can play together with your GF or friend or whatever, this is an excellent choice.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I read a lot of books (around 80-100 per year) and so friends and family often ask me for recommendations, like my brother in law who just got a Kindle. So I made a list of the books I truly consider to be 5 out of 5 stars and I wrote a summary/description for each.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-07-02 07:42:29</DATE>
    <TEXT>This is by no means a complete list, and it focuses on a few genres I know my BIL enjoys, but these are books that I would consider to be 5 out of 5 stars (and I would only give that rating to around 1 out of every 30 books that I read). **Sarum** by Edward Rutherfurd (historical fiction) - This book follows the events of a town in England starting from the stone age up to modern times, each chapter is a different era and the stories tie in together brilliantly. Really well researched, the writing is excellent, the stories are fascinating. Really gets you to think of history not as isolated time periods, but instead view it in the context of all that came before or all that came after. This book, along with Pillars Of The Earth, is IMO the best historical fiction ever written. **Perdido Street Station** by China Mi #233;ville (fantasy/sci-fi, first book in a series) It's hard to categorize this book because it doesn't fit perfectly into a genre. It's part mystery, part fantasy, part sci-fi. The author has an incredible and absolutely fantastic imagination.The world itself is fascinating even without the story. It's a weird book, but in a really really good way. **The Last Kingdom** by Bernard Cornwell,(historical fiction, first book in a series) - This book is set in the 9th and 10th century at the peak of the Viking era when the Danes (vikings) invaded England. This book has a lot of action (sword fights etc) and the main character is bad-ass. Rarely do you find a book with a lot action that is also intelligent and well written. This is one of them. **Slade House** by David Mitchell (suspense/supernatural/horror) - No offense to Stephen King because I've enjoyed so many of his novels, but this book is basically what a Stephen King novel would look like if King were a better writer. (although it is more of a mystery/supernatural book than horror). **All The Pretty Horses** by Cormac McCarthy (historical fiction/western first book in a series) - Don't let the name fool you, this is no lightweight girly book- This is a very gritty and realistic western (as in cowboys). It strips away the bullshit modern Hollywood idealized portrayal of cowboys and is about what their lives were really like. It's Cormac McCarthy so obviously the stories are powerful and sometimes heart-breaking. This trilogy is IMO the greatest western novels ever written. **Shadow And Claw** by Gene Wolfe (fantasy, first book in a series) - A lot of people consider Gene Wolfe to be one of the best fantasy writers ever, maybe just behind Tolkien, and I tend to agree. It's fantasy but it's really original and doesn't have any of the "greatest hits" that most fantasy novels have (you know, elves,wizards, dwarfs) etc. **Soldier Of The Mist** by Gene Wolfe (fantasy meets historical fiction) - Another of Gene Wolfe's best books (perhaps THE best of his books), at its core is historical fiction about a soldier/mercenary in the time of ancient Greece but it adds an unexpected twist- What would it be like if the Greek gods were real? **Here Be Dragons** by Sharon Kay Penman (historical fiction, first book in a series) - A novel about medieval Wales ~~(Southern England)~~ There aren't any dragons in this, the name is a reference to old maps: When part of the map was unexplored or unknown they would write "Here Be Dragons" The history itself isn't very deep, but on the other hand the stories themselves are pretty fast paced and entertaining. (Multiple books with this name, I #8217;m refering to the book by Penman) **Hiroshima** by John Hersey (history, non-fiction) The story of Hiroshima when the bomb was dropped, told by people who were there and survived. The accounts of that day are truly surreal: Obviously, no one in Japan had ever even heard of an atomic bomb and therefore had no idea what the hell had happened to the city. I mean, it's a beautiful summer morning and you are minding your own business and the next thing you know you see a bright flash and in a split second half the city around you has been annihilated, and when you look up you see a monstrous and unnatural looking cloud that is twice the height of mount Everest. Can you imagine? **Name of The Wind** by Patrick Rothfuss (fantasy, first book in a series) - Another book that is pretty straight forward fantasy, with a heavy emphasis on magic. The magic system is really well thought out, lots of action and mystery. **The Long Ships** by Frans G. Bengtsson (historical fiction, first book in a series) - Author is Swedish, and writes of the Viking era from the perspective of the Vikings. Almost all the fiction written about the Vikings is unrealistic and pretty dumb, but not this book. **Prince Of Thorns** by Mark Lawrence (fantasy, first book in a series) - This is pretty much your standard fantasy but well done. Probably more deserving of 4 stars than 5, but that still makes it better than 99% of modern fantasy books. A bit gory and violent (but not overly so). **The First Man in Rome** by Colleen McCullough (historical fiction) - This book is about Rome in the era before, during, and after Julius Caesar, focusing on the politics and conflicts in that era. Really really well researched, I learned A LOT about the Romans, everything from what they ate and what an average day was like, to Roman military tactics, the economy of the era, Roman engineering etc. Top 5 best historical fiction ever written IMO. EDIT: As requested, **[here is an additional list](https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/8vowof/some_of_you_liked_the_list_of_5_star_books_that_i/)** that includes some other genres and more non-fiction.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I mean, I know there are other emperors that are "household names" like Nero or Augustus, but really Caesar stands out from all of them. I get that he was a brilliant man that ruled in an interesting time, and that his death was a sensational story. And I know that his writing has survived so we get insight into the man himself, but is this enough to explain why he is by far the most famous roman emperor?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Some of you liked the list of "5 Star" books that I posted recently. As requested, here is an additional list which includes some other genres and more non-fiction.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-07-03 05:18:32</DATE>
    <TEXT>Some of you liked the [list of 5 star books](https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/8vg8t5/i_read_a_lot_of_books_around_80100_per_year_and/) with descriptions/summaries that I posted the other day. A few of you asked if I could expand the list to include more genres. So here are more books that I consider to be the real gems of my collection, the few and far-in-between that I feel truly deserve 5 out of 5 stars. This list focuses a bit more on non-fiction and serious literature. I tried (to some degree) to emphasize somewhat lesser known books rather than those that are already hugely popular and famous. **I Heard You Paint Houses** by Charles Brandt (non-fiction, true crime) - This book is the memoirs of Frank Sheeran who was a professional hitman and mafia associate. Without explicitly confessing, Sheeran basically claims to have been trigger man on Jimmy Hoffa (completely plausible since Sheeran was known mafia associate and that he was very close to Hoffa). The book tells the story of his background and his rise in the criminal underworld. There are parts of his story that seem to be exaggerated, but overall almost all of it rings true. On a side note, this book also has what I think is absolutely the most plausible theory for the JFK assassination (who ordered it, why they did so, and how it went down). **The Black Dahlia** by James Elroy (fiction-literature, mystery/crime) - Elroy is best known for writing L.A. Confidential, but I think this is his most fascinating book. Why? Well the book is a fictionalized account of one of the most famous unsolved murders in Los Angeles history- the real murder in the 1920's of Elizabeth Short, who was raped and violently murdered (possibly by a serial killer) and was found dead in an empty lot, her body having been cut in half at the waist. The mind-fuck in all of this is that when the author, James Elroy, was a child his own mother was *also* raped and violently murdered. And she was also found dead in an empty lot... in Los Angeles... and also the possible victim of a serial killer. No need to further explain why this book goes to some REALLY dark places. **Burr** by Gore Vidal (historical fiction) - This is a fictionalized account of Aaron Burr's life. Vidal does a brilliant job of presenting a new perspective that questions the established history of a man who has been vilified ever since his duel with Hamilton. Namely, Vidal paints the picture that Burr was actually a pretty decent guy and Alexander Hamilton was kind of an ass. He also presents the theory (which has been popular in some circles for a while) as to what really led to their duel- Burr was a widower and lived with his daughter Theodosia, who was his only surviving child. He and Theodosia had a very close relationship, and without giving too much away lets just say Hamilton was known to imply that their relationship was *too* close. Even though it deals with serious political and historic events, the book is can be fairly light hearted, filled with wit and humor. **Dead Wake** by Erik Larson (non-fiction, military/political history) - This novel is about the sinking of the Lusitania. Larson is pretty famous for Devil In The White City, but I think this might be his best book. Not because the history is necessarily any more fascinating (although the conspiracies about the Lusitania are pretty astonishing), but simply because the tight structure and flow of this book is exceptional. **Collected Stories by Raymond Chandler** (fiction, mystery, crime) - Chandler is the undisputed master of detective noir, and his writing inspired countless other writers and film makers. What surprised me is how much more realistic his stories are than the later imitators. His stories have real, believable characters and plots, with none of the trite cliches that we associate with noir detective stories. His novels like The Big Sleep are also great, but I think his best work is in his short stories and novellas. **Gotham: A history of New York City** by Edwin Burrows (history, non-fiction) - This is not only the best book on history that I have read, I truly feel (without hyperbole) that this book it is one of the greatest works in all of literature. I've always felt that the best non-fiction books are those that take something you didn't even know you were interested in and make it absolutely fascinating. Well, Burrows does that about a million times in this book. The book is huge, and you'd think a 1,400 page book can't be a gripping page turner. But I'll be damned if this book isn't exactly that. **Blood And Thunder** by Hampton Sides (non-fiction, history, biography) - This book is about Kit Carson, the legendary tracker and scout. I didn't really know much about Kit Carson, but came away with an immense respect. Carson led a fantastically adventurous life, but more than that he comes across as a truly great man: he was clever and intelligent, incredibly brave, and modest almost to a fault. This book also deals in a larger sense with the American expansion into the West, the conflicts with Native Americans as well as with Spain/Mexico. The book doesn't really make judgements about the horrible treatment of native Americans, but I do feel it tries to present an accurate and unbiased picture. **The Return of The Native** by Thomas Hardy (literature). - This book is basically tied IMO with "Jude The Obscure" as Hardy's best books. Among my friends that are serious readers, Hardy is possibly the most unknown or underrated authors. This is unfortunate because Hardy is one of the best writers I #8217;ve ever read. His books are entertaining, sophisticated and utterly beautiful. He tends to focus on the themes of rigid societal structure and norms, and the damage they can do to the individual. Hardy also was decades ahead of his time with regards to female characters, showing true respect and giving them intelligence and depth. In fact, in the hundred + years since, I can't think of a male author that has written better female characters. Hardy's prose is absolutely superb, it's no surprise that he was also a gifted poet. **Five Families** by Selwyn Raab (non-fiction, history, crime) - The history of the American mafia, starting with their roots in ancient Sicily and going right up the RICO cases of the 1990's. There isn't much to explain about this book- it is THE book about the American mafia. It is comprehensive and informative but also very entertaining. A must-read for anyone at all interested in organized crime. **Blood Meridian** by Cormac McCarthy (fiction, American West) - I have to mention this book simply because I feel that Cormac McCarthy is the greatest living novelist. That said, his books are not for everyone, and I can understand why. For one thing, his prose can be unconventional (never uses quotation marks, for example) and he deals with profound but sometimes nebulous concepts. The themes can be heavy, but there is true beauty there for those willing to look. **American Gods** by Neil Gaiman (fiction, mythology) Full disclosure: this book does have flaws. That said, Neil Gaiman is one of the most brilliant and imaginative authors in modern history. That alone makes pretty much makes any of his books worth reading. The general premise of this book is that the protagonist discovers that the gods are real. Not some gods, all gods, from Shiva to Odin, Anansi to Jesus Christ. The story is great and as a bonus I learned a lot of mythology from different religions and cultures. **The Emperor Of All Maladies** by Siddhartha Mukherjee (non-fiction, science/medicine, history) - Along with "Guns, Germs and Steel" this is possibly the best non-fiction book about science in recent history. Essentially, it is the history of cancer and of humanity's fight against it. More broadly, it is a fascinating journey through the history of medicine from the ancient texts that first mentioned cancer right through to the brilliant breakthroughs of modern medicine. Accessible to anyone, you need not have a scientific background to enjoy it. **A Fire Upon The Deep** by Vernor Vinge (science fiction) - I love science fiction, but the sad reality is that it is a genre that is buried by a mountain of really, really shitty books. But when an author gets it right, it's magic. Vernor Vinge is one of those authors, and this is one of those books. The author is a scientist (a mathematician, to be precise) and this is considered "hard science fiction". That means that the science in the book is (generally speaking) plausible. But beyond that, this book is a fantastic story, very thought-provoking, and is my favorite science fiction book (and sci-fi series) of all time. **The Sun In Splendour** by Sharon Kay Penman (historical fiction, literature) - In the other list I had a few books that I consider among the best historical fiction I've read. This book is right there with them. It is a fictionalized story of Richard III of England. As they say, the victors write the history and this was the case with Richard. He was vilified after his death, and Shakespeare's play pretty much solidified that view. But Penman's book presents an alternate viewpoint and she cleverly questions the generally accepted views. For example, Shakespeare and others described Richard III as a coward. How then to explain the fact that we know he was seriously wounded in battle more than once, and that he eventually died in battle? **The Worst Hard Time** by Timothy Egan (history, non fiction) - This book is about the American Dust Bowl. The book is part science and examines the geography, environmental factors, and human impact that resulted in the Dust Bowl. The rest of the book is the riveting first-hand accounts of the people that lived lived through incredible weather events that are almost unbelievable: storms that in a single day could displace 300 million tons of soil and carry it far enough to completely cover New York City in a layer of dust</TEXT>

    <DATE>2018-07-09 00:15:05</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi there, I #8217;m down 30 pounds in three months mostly by strict portion control. One thing that I think has helped is when I get a snacky feeling (particularly at work) I just eat a couple of pieces of sugar free hard candy and it takes my mind off of it. I know there are a billion healthier alternatives for snacks, but this is what has worked for me. Anyway, the downside is I haven #8217;t been able to find any decent sugar free candy except for Jolly Ranchers, Life Savers, Werther #8217;s, and Ricola, and frankly I #8217;m getting a bit of flavor fatigue from these. So I was wondering if you guys know of any sugar free and relatively low calorie candy worth trying. (btw not talking about him since there are hundreds of sugar free gums out there)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>A tip that has really helped me cut my calorie intake without feeling hungry: follow a strictly timed meal schedule and eat at exactly the same times. This helps in a few ways.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-07-09 07:09:00</DATE>
    <TEXT>I never really see this mentioned in regards to weight loss, but something that has really helped me cut my calorie intake to below 1,000 per day without feeling hungry is to follow a strictly timed meal schedule. What I mean is to eat at EXACTLY the same time, and always the same portion size. While the first few days are tough, what I #8217;ve learned is that with a strictly timed eating schedule your body adapts and gets locked into the rhythm. I eat at exactly 9:30, 2pm, and 7pm. Now that my body has gotten used to it, I don #8217;t really feel hungry until right before my meal, when my body  #8220;knows #8221; it is time to eat. I also use meal planning and prepare food ahead of time to make sure that for the respective meals I eat the exact same amount every time (I literally weigh it and try to get it to the gram). My body has also adjusted to *that* aspect, so I don #8217;t feel unsatisfied or still hungry after eating as I sometimes do if portion sizes vary. And this has the added bonus of not having to think about what to eat. To me, having to decide what to eat is just another opportunity for temptation to sneak in. If your food already is prepared and you are on a timed schedule, you never really have to think about it. This has helped me, I #8217;ve lost 30 pounds in under 3 months and am half way to my goal.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>From a football-crazy Brazilian, i just want to say I am absolutely in amazement of the Croatian team. I don #8217;t believe I #8217;ve ever seen a more relentless team, a team with more determination and faith in themselves, an undying will to win and absolutely no quit in them at all. For a nation only 60% of the population of the city of Rio, making the World Cup final is truly amazing. But these Croatian players are not just a credit to their nation, they are a credit to the entire human species. A real inspiration. BRAVO!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Love Doom 4, but one criticism I have is the way they designed secret areas.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-07-15 22:15:26</DATE>
    <TEXT>So obviously this is one of the best shoot-em-ups in recent history, the game is a blast. One criticism I would have though is the secret areas. For one thing, the way they are designed is so inconsistent and not intuitive. I #8217;m not saying they are too difficult, the issue is the fact that I can spend 15 minutes trying to access what What looks like it could possibly be a secret area, and I have no idea if I #8217;m not getting there because I #8217;m barely missing the jump or if there is actually no way to get there and there is not a secret area there. . I don #8217;t mind searching, I don #8217;t mind exploring or some trial and error. But there needs to be a sort of consistency in which the secret areas are presented. If part of the map looks like it might be accessible but it isn #8217;t, there should be more clarity in how the area is presented. For example if there is a ledge that looks perhaps accessible but it really isn #8217;t, don #8217;t put a box that you can climb and possibly make the jump. Make the box a foot shorter so I can know right away when I get up there  #8220;Yeah, I don #8217;t think that is reachable. #8221; The attempts to to get reach inaccessible areas I think harms the exploration aspect of the game. Again, it #8217;s not that it is too difficult or hard to find those areas- I don #8217;t mind that at all. It #8217;s just the amount of time wasted on on false positives.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah I think the user score is sometimes more accurate. For one thing, reviewers have an agenda. I don #8217;t just mean like their corporate relationships, I mean that some times the reviewers give a game a higher score because they think it #8217;s a game people *should* be playing. This probably happens more with indie games. Second, they often just play a game long enough to be able to write the review. Users may play the game for 100 hours before they rate it, and they will have a better grasp I think of the game and it #8217;s flaws, it #8217;s true value with regards to playability etc. EDIT: OK, I get it, there is a lot of BS in user scores too.

A massive crowd gathered on the other (eastern) side to hear Bowie perform from over the wall.

    <TEXT>Been learning a lot about Bowie lately, such a talented artist and an incredible song writer. There are tons of good articles about this performance. The huge crowd on the eastern side of the wall was unexpected. There was no violence, but the guards had real trouble keeping people from getting too close to the wall. Soon the crowd on the western side realized what was happening (although they could not see each other) and then *they* moved to be near the wall as well, which by all accounts was an emotional moment, and Bowie said he himself was in tears. Anyway, such a powerful song, and [This video](http://reddit.com/r/Frisson/comments/90j8er/video_david_byrne_of_the_talking_heads_was/) this video I think further illustrates it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah he completely shoots down the possibility of the performance having any impact whatsoever, and then lists a whole myriad of things that supposedly did have an impact.  #8220;There were all sorts of things, big and small, that played a role in the fall of the wall. Except for the one thing you said. No chance that that played a role. #8221; I mean honestly the biggest argument for the impact of that night is from the former East Germans that were there. There are plenty of accounts where they say it *was* a powerful moment and it *did* have an affect on the mood of the populace. And on a side note, I have to mention that in the 20-30 comments in this thread where people list events and people that they feel played a part in the fall of the wall and the dissolution of the U.S.S.R, they list everything from grain shortages to oil prices, and credit everyone from Margaret Thatcher to Helmut Kohl. Not a single one mentions Gorbachev. You know, the guy running the U.S.S.R at the time? The guy who implemented perestroika, eased restrictions, allowed for a more open society, and enacted many other reforms that made the dissolution of the U.S.S.R inevitable? You can argue that Regan and Thatcher etc had a huge impact. But you can also argue that without Gorbachev, there is almost no chance it would have happened when it did.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think the appeal is for a few reasons: First off, it looks fantastic. You can #8217;t discount that aspect, presentation is clearly a key part to enjoying the meal, otherwise why would chefs work so hard for it. The Wellington definitely has a wow factor in that regard. Second, it #8217;s bread. Delicious fresh baked bread, which is *always* a good addition to a meal. Now as far as the flavor, what #8217;s good about it is that the beef inside is covered with gravy while it cooks, which does impart some flavor to the beef. The gravy also goes along great with the bread, in the way people like to sop up gravy with a biscuit or eat the bread in a soup bread bowl. Lastly, since the meat is sealed in there while it cooks, it retains all of the moisture and further makes the meat tender. You seem to know food so you probably know that a steak needs to rest after grilling because if you cut it right away the juice will run out. Well, this method completely traps the juice in there which pretty much guarantees that the meat stays juicy. Now, you say why not just eat a grilled steak with a good roll, which I agree is probably is the ultimate way to enjoy a good quality cut of meat like that. So the answer is this: variety. Even if there is a  #8220;best #8221; way to eat something, that doesn #8217;t mean you don #8217;t ever want to eat it a different way. Like for me, the ultimate pizza is with pepperoni, bacon, mushrooms, and black olives. That doesn #8217;t mean I don #8217;t sometimes want to eat a 4 cheese pizza, or a white pizza, or even a BBQ pizza. The best flavor of ice cream ever is Hagen Daz  #8220;Caramel Cone #8221;. But, again, that doesn #8217;t mean you don #8217;t sometimes want cookies n cream, or butter pecan, etc.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Surely you can't be that clueless and uninformed. Aside from glasnost and all of the reforms that Gorbachev implemented, which (as he admitted and any historian would agree) put the Soviet Union on the path to democracy and made the dissolution of the U.S.S.R. inevitable, it was Gorbachev who allowed 11 members of the U.S.S.R to break away without any violence (something that would have been unthinkable just 10 years before). It was Gorbachev who allowed the coup to be bloodless at a time when it very easily could have turned into a civil war (and escalated from there into a regional war- or worse). It was Gorbachev who resigned and let the U.S.S.R. die a peaceful death. I mean, just read part of his resignation speech:  gt;"I find it important because there have been a lot of controversial, superficial, and unbiased judgments made on this score. Destiny so ruled that when I found myself at the helm of this state it already was clear that something was wrong in this country.  gt;We had a lot of everything -- land, oil and gas, other natural resources -- and there was intellect and talent in abundance. However, we were living much worse than people in the industrialized countries were living and we were increasingly lagging behind them. The reason was obvious even then. This country was suffocating in the shackles of the bureaucratic command system. Doomed to cater to ideology, and suffer and carry the onerous burden of the arms race, it found itself at the breaking point.  gt;All the half-hearted reforms -- and there have been a lot of them -- fell through, one after another. This country was going nowhere and we couldn't possibly live the way we did. We had to change everything radically.  gt;It is for this reason that I have never had any regrets -- never had any regrets -- that I did not use the capacity of General Secretary just to reign in this country for several years. I would have considered it an irresponsible and immoral decision. I was also aware that to embark on reform of this caliber and in a society like ours was an extremely difficult and even risky undertaking. But even now, I am convinced that the democratic reform that we launched in the spring of 1985 was historically correct." To compare him to Hitler is beyond absurd. Gorbachev is widely respected in the west, which is hardly true of Hitler. If Hitler had lived, I somehow don't think he would have spent his retirement going on hugely successful lecture tours throughout the world.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Apologies, I didn #8217;t get the joke. I #8217;m clearly a bit defensive about it. Especially in this climate, people shit on government employees constantly. When you tell someone your wife has a government job, they immediately picture a person making a 6 figure salary who works 12 hours a week and their whole purpose is to waste tax dollars. Not to mention, the politicians abuse the shit out of government employees as well, trying to whip up their base against  #8220;big government #8221;. IMO the overwhelming majority are true public servants with a sense of duty who put a lot into helping our society and our country. My wife works 50 hours a week and absolutely busts her ass for the people she is trying to help. I can guarantee you that every penny that agency gets is well spent.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>On recipe websites, when someone reviews a recipe they should have to select  #8220;I made this exactly as written #8221; or  #8220;I made changes to the recipe #8221;. That way, the reviews could be sorted into those two groups.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-07-22 22:09:41</DATE>
    <TEXT>I mean it #8217;s pretty much a a running joke now, how reviewers on cooking websites (and not just Allrecipes) completely change a recipe around, which means that the review does not accurately reflect the recipe. The worst is when they screw a recipe up and then say it sucks.  #8220;I tried to make this healthier so I used water instead of cream, margarine instead of butter, turkey instead of pork, and left out the sugar, salt, and cheese. It tasted terrible, I won #8217;t make this again. #8221; But the opposite is also true- I made a recipe once that had fantastic reviews, but the dish I made had so much salt it was almost inedible. When I looked at the reviews, all of the positive ones said  #8220;I cut the salt in half and it was great. #8221; Or  #8220;Good recipe, but use less salt. #8221; If the reviews had been organized by people who stuck to the recipe, I would have known that the recipe had a flaw in it. Anyway, a simple drop-down box with the two options would solve this whole issue, and would require hardly any effort from the website. And I #8217;m not necessarily talking about Allrecipes, which I don #8217;t often use, but some of the other ones.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I read an article a few years ago that said the same thing about politics: politicians have no interest whatsoever in solving or resolving an issue, because as soon as they do the lobby money goes away. For example, if their is a medical policy issue with the pharmaceutical companies lobbying on one side, and hospitals and patient rights groups on the other, politicians want the issue to drag on and on because as long as it #8217;s unresolved, the money keeps coming in. If they pass a conclusive law/bill that resolves the issue, the lobbyists pack up and go home, show #8217;s over. I think obviously this is a major factor as to why our health care systems is perpetually fucked up, and also why Congress has recently gotten into the habit of passing these short-term funding bills, kicking the can down the road another 3 months, rather than come up with a consistent and strategic budget for the next 1 to 2 years.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So listen: I did some statistical analysis to try and break down what Carmelo #8217;s positive vs negative impact would be at Houston. It gets a bit technical here so bear with me: Carmelo averaged 16.2 PPG last season. So what I did is I went through every Houston game (including pre and post season) and added 16 points to their score. This resulted in them winning an extra 11 games and would have made a trip to the finals almost a certainty. Conclusion: Whatever team Carmelo goes to, bet the whole damn farm on them to win the championship.</TEXT>

The nature of holding elected office is the embodiment of  #8220;you can #8217;t please everyone. #8221; And I #8217;m not saying that in an attempt to be sympathetic, I #8217;m just saying that pretty much *every* issue has strongly held beliefs on both sides so no matter what you do, a significant part of the population will be pissed off at you. And therefore you should be prepared to face constant criticism pretty much every step of the way, no matter *what* you do. Which is why it is crazy to me that these people who go fucking apoplectic whenever they are criticized decided to get into politics in the first place.</TEXT>

From a political perspective, it #8217;s almost pointless to focus on issues that are  #8220;important #8221; to young people, like the cost of education, because they will talk about it on social media daily but when Election Day comes they stay home.

The polling center is actually in my neighborhood, at the clubhouse.

    <TITLE>Are there any bars that have a good range of vitamins and nutrients but with not a lot of calories? It seems like all the bars right now are obsessed with protein and to hell with everything else.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-07-25 06:27:17</DATE>
    <TEXT>Pretty frustrating that right now all of the bars only focus on protein, when the average American already consumes more than twice the necessary protein per day. I #8217;m not saying that there aren #8217;t people who need it, just frustrated that it #8217;s pretty much the ONLY thing the bars focus on. Anyway, I don #8217;t need a bar with 75 grams of protein and 380 calories, I just want a healthy snack for when I #8217;m running errands etc. The best bars I #8217;ve found are the Fiber D #8217;lish ones because at least they have something my body needs and they taste amazing, it #8217;s hard to believe they are like 120 to 140 calories. But what I was hoping to find is a bar that gives a wider range of necessary vitamins and nutrients, without too many calories.</TEXT>

Unless you are really active like an athlete, or trying to put on weight (muscle) there is not really much reason to be eating almost 30g of protein in a  #8220;snack #8221;.</TEXT>

I realize that they were completely different style of players, but the fact is having two big men down there *will* be redundant in some ways, and I think it allows less flexibility from a strategic point of view.

    <TEXT>BTW some of this is in part because after WWI when Germany went into a terrible economic depression, Brazil was one of the most popular places for Germans to emigrate. You #8217;ll see it in how common German last names are in Brazil, my own family is one. Parts of southern Brazil had huge German enclaves- although my grandparents were born in Brazil, my mother and her family still spoke German at home (I #8217;m talking about the 1970 #8217;s now, 50 years after they left Germany) and there is still a German language newspaper in that town. Anyway, a lot of those German-Brazilians were sick of war, and they didn #8217;t like Hitler because of his militaristic tendencies.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Obviously it is silly to stereotype an entire country, but the Brazilian stereotype of the  #8220;typical #8221; Argentinians is that they are elitists with a superiority complex. Argentinian tourists have a bad reputation for the same reasons, viewed as people who demand special treatment and who are condescending to waiters, hotel staff, etc. Also, while most of South America views breaking away from Europe as basically a liberation from colonial oppressors, the Argentinians hold onto (in fact pride themselves) on their ties to Europe. I mean, Argentinians like to refer to Buenos Aires as the  #8220;Paris of South America #8221;, to which Brazilians counter that  #8220;Rio de Janeiro is the Rio de Janeiro of South America #8221;.</TEXT>

For example there was one clip where Carpe was running down the stairs and then spun around in a circle. But he didn #8217;t just spin around, you could see him get a kill on the kill feed, and if you slow it down you can see he spun, headshotted McCree who had just jumped on to his level, then spun back and kept going. I shit you not McCree was in the frame for *maybe* 0.3 seconds.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think some of you are underestimating, and too quickly dismissing, the revenue from the luxury market. 10% of global vehicle sales is nothing to scoff at, especially since it is also the fastest growing segment of the vehicle market. And to further illustrate how much money those luxury cars make: The largest exporter of American made cars (by value) is [actually BMW, believe it or not](https://www.bmwusfactory.com/bmw_articles/bmw-manufacturing-continues-as-largest-u-s-automotive-exporter/). Their plant in South Carolina is the largest BMW plant in the world, and is where they build the X5. And JUST by exporting the X5 (and no other model) BMW beats every other exporter in total value, because a single one of those is sells for as much as 2-3 average cars. Just because Tesla isn #8217;t yet competing with Toyota doesn #8217;t mean it isn #8217;t impressive that they are already competing with (and in some cases beating) luxury brands that have been around for 90 years.</TEXT>

But also: I #8217;ve been  #8220;secretly #8221; bringing snacks for my co-workers for over a year now, and no one knows who brings them. What happened is I decided to start eating healthier and so I took a box of [ #8220;Nutty Bars #8221;](https://m.imgur.com/fy1LGPA) out of my pantry at home. I didn #8217;t want them to go to waste so I brought them to work and put them in the break room. I was surprised how happy my co-workers were to find the box, I mean it totally made their day. So the next day I bought another box and brought it in. Again, everyone super happy. So now every time I go the grocery store I buy a box and leave it in the break room. By now, I #8217;ve probably brought around 60-70 boxes and no one knows who brings them (they have suspicions). I have so much fun watching them speculate and presenting theories. One day I took an empty box and put it on the housekeeping lady #8217;s cart, so for a good while they were convinced it was her.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>One of my best friends growing up was black. He was also a really big guy, but was about as gentle and laid-back of a person as I #8217;ve ever known. Over the years I absolutely noticed how people acted different when I was walking along beside him as opposed to by myself. Some of the most common things I #8217;d see was women would kind of shift their purse to get a better grip, and mothers would reach and take their children #8217;s hands. I #8217;m not sure they even realized they were doing it. Also, in stores, If I would walk in and the clerk was watching tv or reading, they #8217;d barely look up to give a brief nod. If Kofi was with me, I #8217;m not saying they would follow us around or anything, but they #8217;d definitely stop what they were doing and pay more attention as we walked around the store.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>One of my best friends growing up was black. He was also a really big guy, but was about as gentle and laid-back of a person as I #8217;ve ever known. Over the years I absolutely noticed how people acted different when I was walking along beside him as opposed to by myself. Some of the most common things I #8217;d see was women would kind of shift their purse to get a better grip, and mothers would reach and take their children #8217;s hands. I #8217;m not sure they even realized they were doing it. Also, in stores, If I would walk in and the clerk was watching tv or reading, they #8217;d barely look up to give a brief nod. If Kofi was with me, I #8217;m not saying they would follow us around or anything, but they #8217;d definitely stop what they were doing and pay more attention as we walked around the store.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I mean, I know that #8217;s a lot of money but I know I #8217;ve been happier with my clothes once I focused more on quality over quantity. Years ago I realized that every time I went into my shirt drawer I always looked for the 2 or 3 most comfortable/best quality shirts and it sucked when they were dirty and I had to  #8220;settle #8221; for a different one. So I had a minor epiphany me that having 4 or 5 quality shirts (even if they cost more) was better than having 2 quality shirts and 14 average ones. So that #8217;s been my philosophy ever since. I mean, the average American already owns an obscene amount of clothes. I know people that could literally wear something different every day for half a year without repeating. It #8217;s liberating when you realize no one gives a fuck if you wore the same shirt last Tuesday.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Need a little advice: I was in a wreck with my BRZ, the car was repaired but I have a question about hood alignment.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-08-04 09:42:39</DATE>
    <TEXT>Was in a wreck a few weeks ago with my 2017 BRZ. Wouldn #8217;t have been too bad except the other guy was in a tall truck and so rather than hit my bumper, his truck drove directly into the hood and messed up a bunch of stuff in there. Anyway, I picked up the car today from the body shop. I did a walk round, but later when I got home I noticed that the hood isn #8217;t perfectly aligned: the gap between hood and fender is larger on one side than the other, maybe a difference of like 4 to 5 millimeters, and in the front where the hood is up against the bumper, one side of the hood is maybe 4 or 5 millimeters higher than the other. I think a lot of people might not have noticed it, but I #8217;ve washed and waxed the car so much I #8217;m pretty intimate with the lines. And now that I #8217;ve noticed it #8217;s obvious to me any time I look at it. So, my understanding (I have very limited knowledge on this stuff) is that when they replace a hood they are supposed to adjust and align it, and this looks like maybe they got it just a bit wrong. Is that correct? How exactly do they do that anyway?(align and adjust the hood) Do you guys think if I go back Monday and point it out they will have any problems realigning it? I guess what I #8217;m asking is would it be a pretty simple thing for them to do? I #8217;m kind of worried that it is something that is a pain and that maybe they will give push back and say something like that it is normal for there to be small differences in the gaps etc. (BTW for what it #8217;s worth I #8217;ve used this shop before and have always been fair and good to deal with)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>They are upset that New York wouldn #8217;t let them sell insurance which covers legal expenses if they are ever in a shooting even if the NRA member is the one at fault and is charged with a crime. This insurance is illegal in New York for the obvious reason that you could essentially be selling insurance to criminals in case they get caught. In other words, some gang member could buy this insurance for $40 a month and then shoot people in gang violence. If they ever get caught, the insurance would pay their legal fees. So the NRA is claiming to be a victim because New York isn #8217;t letting them sell shady, illegal insurance. Wow, their concept of freedom and liberty is as fucked up as the religious right, who think freedom of religion means the right to discriminate against other religions.</TEXT>

His children seem like great kids, and even with all the demands on his time he manages to be involved. An excellent anecdote: Lebron #8217;s daughter plays the piano. Lebron #8217;s wife said the daughter was complaining it was  #8220;unfair #8221; that she had to practice the piano every day while no one else did. So what did Lebron do? He started learning piano as well from the same teacher just to show her that it #8217;s not punishment, there is a reason for practice and hard work, and that if he can practice the piano every day even with his schedule, she can too. LeBron is also an assistant coach on his son #8217;s basketball team and bought a small bus (like the airport shuttle kind) which he himself drives as the main car pool parent for his other son #8217;s soccer team.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No American athlete has ever been under as much scrutiny and for as long as LeBron has. By 17 he was already a household name and since then pretty much every single action he has taken has been analyzed and scrutinized ad nauseum. And don #8217;t forget that he is one of the *first* world-famous athletes whose entire career has been in the modern internet age where even a small mistake can be blown up to immense proportions and where everything you say or do is recorded and posted on the internet. Yet, in all that time, all LeBron has done is behave professionally, with no scandals, and by all accounts has been an excellent citizen, husband, and father. Meanwhile Trump can #8217;t go 3 days without doing something embarrassing.</TEXT>

The way the NBA does it, most players in the league have hands measuring between 9 and 10 inches, and the players with the largest hands ever are around 11.5 Kareem #8217;s hands were measured at ~9 inches, and I #8217;d be pretty shocked if a 7 footer #8217;s hands were the same size as any 5 #8217; 11 #8221; person.</TEXT>

First time I #8217;ve done something like this, and they came out better than I expected. I don #8217;t think you would know they are plasti dipped unless you got close and felt them. HAPPY 86 DAY!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No, I found a good method of using playing cards (I actually used index cards) which you kind of tuck in between the wheel and the tire which completely keeps the tires clean. There are YouTube videos. I just went around taking off and doing one tire at a time. Because of the wait between coats I did it over the course of a weekend.</TEXT>

I originally bought cans of the gloss that you spray over it, but I liked the matte look so much I left them like that. In hindsight I would have applied some of the gloss just because otherwise the texture is more rough so it picks up dirt and dust.</TEXT>

I mean, it was already absurd to see the people ripping him during these past playoffs when he was dragging a team of scrubs to the finals, but this is downright fucking *comical*. LeBron is the first American sports superstar to play almost his entire career in the modern internet age, where even the tiniest thing can be scrutinized and where every single thing you say will be posted on the internet *forever*. From the time he was 17 to now, he has been scrutinized more than any American athlete in history. And all LeBron has done during those 16 years is to behave as a consummate professional who by all accounts is an excellent citizen, teammate, husband and father. Some of you people need to get rid of the demons and issues inside of you that can make you hate a person like that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Look man, I completely understand where you are coming from, and I commend you for taking the high road. I personally don #8217;t believe in demonizing politicians or assuming that if they have different views they are evil. For example, as much as I hated George W. Bush #8217;s policies, I really do believe that his decisions were made from a genuine desire to do what he thought was the best for the country. And I believe that #8217;s true of most GOP congressmen such as McCain, Lindsey Graham, and (yes) even Paul Ryan But Trump is not even remotely in that category. He is a con man, a criminal, and an absolute fraud. There is absolutely no point trying to find common ground with Trump, because he *has no sincere beliefs at all*. He doesn #8217;t care about *anything* beyond himself and he would run the whole country right into the ground if he thought he could benefit from it. This isn #8217;t a time for normal politics, anymore than it was in Germany in 1933. Hitler #8217;s political opponents tried to keep it civil even when it was clear that Hitler had no such desire. And by the time they realized their mistake it was too late. Thank god our system of checks and balances have kept his power in check, because if he were given free reign Trump would utterly destroy this country.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My easiest go to recipe is get 1 or two lbs of hamburger and brown. Then drain it, add a jar or two of Rao #8217;s marinara sauce to a pot, put the meat back in and let it all simmer for at least 10 minutes (although preferably 45 mi mutes or so). Serve with any pasta and top with Parmesan. I usually make enough for 2-3 days worth and just make more pasta right before eating. It also freezes pretty well. M And yes, I realize this is barely  #8220;cooking #8221; but the fact is that these days (as opposed to when I was growing up and it was just Prego and Ragu) you can buy some pretty damn decent marinara sauce in a jar, and there is no reason not to take advantage of that. Everyone I #8217;ve ever cooked this for enjoyed it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>What sucks about customer service and tech support these days (and not just at EA) is the fact that every time the first person you talk to has to bump you up to talk to a higher level person such as their supervisor (or team leader, account specialist, whatever they want to call it) that is logged and counted and it goes *against* the tech support person. In other words, if a supervisor has to get involved too often, they view it as you can #8217;t do your job adequately and you can be written up and eventually even fired. And conversely, if the percentage of calls bumped up is very low, they will be eligible for periodic pay raises. So the result is that these people are so reluctant to let you talk with a supervisor that they will literally just lie and say that nothing can be done beyond their level, even if they know it isn #8217;t true because the supervisor has more tools/capabilities to remedy the situation. I called tech support for my ISP once and finally had to ask for a supervisor because the guy I was talking to really had no clue what he was doing and just kept repeating the same basic trouble shooting steps ( #8220;Yes, I #8217;ve tried turning off the modem and unplugging it for 10 seconds,I #8217;ve already told you that like 3 times #8221;) Anyway, point of the story is that when I asked for a supervisor this guy put me on hold and came back on the phone pretending to be his supervisor. It was so fucking obvious because the guy had a slight speech impediment (his Rs sounded like Ws) and the voice as the same. I swear to god that #8217;s a true story, and I totally called him out on it and asked why the fuck he was lying to me, then I asked for his badge number and the line went dead. I emailed the company to complain about it, but I doubt that ever went anywhere.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>One real problem I worry about is that Trump won #8217;t go away after he leaves office. Traditionally, former presidents keep a low political profile immediately after leaving the White House, as Clinton, W, and Obama have done. They eventually get back involved in support of charity or maybe do some lecturing, perhaps occasionally chiming in on a political issue. But for the most part, they fade into the background. But not Trump. I guarantee that when he loses in 2020 he will NOT go down quietlly, he will say the election was rigged (of course he would, could you ever see Trump admitting that he lost?) and I guarantee he will stay on Twitter and Fox News riling up his base, attacking whoever defeats him and trying to destroy the legitimacy of our democracy. This fucker won #8217;t be satisfied until he destroys this nation.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Holy crap! That sous vide method for cooking steaks is the real f***ing deal.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-08-12 22:03:19</DATE>
    <TEXT>Decided to give it a try so I bought a sous vide setup from Amazon. One reason I wanted it is because I sometimes find it difficult to get a uniformity of done-ness throughout the steak. But everyone here is absolutely blown away. For one thing, it is not an exaggeration AT ALL how the steaks stay more plump and retain their moisture. If anything, the contrast in the steaks I made was even bigger than [in the photos.](https://anovaculinary.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/sous-vide-steak-vs.-traditionally-cooked-steak.001.jpeg) Secondly, it takes any guesswork out of it. No need to adjust cooking depending on how thick the steaks are or exactly how hot the grill is at a particular time. Just set the temperature electronically and every inch is cooked perfectly, with edge-to-edge uniformity. Lastly, the low and slow cooking breaks down the connective tissue so the steak is like butter. I can #8217;t believe you can get a whole setup for under $100. Just a few years ago these were only designed for restaurants and cost *thousands* of dollars. Absolutely worth it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I cooked some medium rare steaks today. I believe that time/temperature do depend a bit on the thickness of the steaks. Mine were pretty thick and I did 133 degrees for1 hour and 50 minutes. Also, I seared mine on a higher temp and for less time. I got a cast iron skillet super hot and then seared them for 15-20 seconds per side. Which machine are you using, out of curiosity? BTW some people in here put the steaks immediately (in the bag) in an ice bath after cooking, that allows you to sear them without cooking them any further. I didn #8217;t, but I did let them cook down for 2 minutes or so before searing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Technically this has been tried, but very few people have ever heard of it: Japanese and Brazilian/German. Story time: Most people don #8217;t know this, but the largest population of Japanese people outside of Japan is actually in Brazil, where there are as many as two million people that are Japanese or of Japanese descent. The Japanese came to Brazil in large part due to cheap or free farmland which the govt offered because they wanted to settle some more remote parts of the country (not match different than what the USA did with the West). So the Japanese were mainly farmers, and they mixed with the farmers of the other big immigrant population in Brazil: Germans. The result is an incredible culinary fusion that is little known outside of a few regions in Brazil. It #8217;s a fusion of Japanese and the heavily German influenced Brazilian cuisine, and it #8217;s incredible. The Japanese influence is expressed in a heavy focus on soups and rice dishes as well as an emphasis on fresh ingredients (I mean vegetables, mainly) and clean, clear flavors. The German/Brazilian influence is expressed in hearty and dense breads, potato dishes, braised meat dishes, and (yes) sausages. The result is fuckkng incredible. SOURCE: Am Brazilian.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My story is pretty horrific, and it fucked me up for a long time. It happened due to the bystander effect, although I didn #8217;t learn what that was until years later. The story is that when I was around 6 or 7 years old, I was visiting a friend and his mother took us to the local playground. While there, a slightly older kid (maybe 8 or 9) was unsupervised and swinging upside down on the monkey bars when he fell and hit his head really hard. It #8217;s hard to know just how badly he was injured because even small cuts on the scalp can bleed a lot, but within seconds he was absolutely *covered* in blood, which was running down his face and onto his clothes and arms etc. At first, the kid just sat up and started wailing. I guess he expected (as I did) that with him crying and the fact that anyone could clearly see he had serious injury, an adult would quickly come to help. They didn #8217;t. No one came to help. The park was full, maybe 25 kids and 10 parents. Every single person there just stopped and stared in silence. Eventually, the kid realized no one was coming to help him, so he got to his feet and started sort of stumbling and wandering around, saying over and over,  #8220;Help me. Someone please help me. #8221; No one did. After a few minutes he just left, bleeding profusely, and started walking home. The event was seared into my brain. I realize now that it shook a belief I had as a child that with adults around I would always be safe. And for the longest time I thought that *surely* there was something I missed, some other factor that would have explained why a bleeding injured child was ignored by a playground full of people. It wasn #8217;t until years later when I learned about [the bystander effect](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bystander_effect?wprov=sfti1) that I finally understood what had happened. God, it honestly still makes me upset and sort of anxious even thinking about it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Exactly. Isn #8217;t this basically Trump #8217;s argument for why we should keep burning coal? If I boycott a company, yes, innocent people might get the shaft. But if I spend my money elsewhere, *that* company becomes more profitable and may give jobs to other equally deserving people. The bottom line is I do view spending my money as a vote. I always have and always will choose to give my money to companies that I feel deserve my patronage, and let the chips fall where they may.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The NFL #8217;s position on this makes absolutely no sense to me. Adam Silver, the NBA commissioner, was asked about this and I loved his answer. He basically said that it would be hypocritical for the league to constantly encourage players to get involved in the community, to use their celebrity to promote important causes, to donate time and resources to charity, only to turn around and fine or suspend the player if the cause they take up is controversial or is one that Silver doesn #8217;t personally agree with, because the fact is that many of the most important causes *are* controversial. But I think it boils down to the culture of the different leagues and the approach the commissioner takes. Adam Silver views his role as a facilitator whose goal is to help the league thrive. He knows it is not a zero sum game, that it is possible for everyone to win: for the owners to make a profit, for players to be paid and treated fairly, and for the fans to enjoy the product. Meanwhile, Roger Goodell seems to think his job is to be the cop of the NFL. Almost any time you he is in the news it is because he fined that played, or suspended this player, etc. He absolutely views the players as antagonists of his, not as business partners the way Silver does.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well I would counter that I doubt it would be held up in court that the typical employer can mandate it as a job duty that you stand for the national anthem, or participate in a pre-game prayer etc. Sure, your employer can tell you what shirt you have to wear, whether you can have long hair etc and you can #8217;t protest by breaking those rules and not expect penalties. But the anthem is a much more nebulous area. I mean, what if a Mexican billionaire bought an NFL team- could he force the players to stand for the Mexican national anthem?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I had sort of the opposite (but still awesome) experience. During one of their U.S. tours, The Cure played in the town I was living in at the time (in Alabama). The arena could seat around 11,000 people, but *maybe* 2,000 people showed up (because it #8217;s Alabama). Anyway, Robert Smith acknowledged it right away, and he said something to the effect that they hadn #8217;t played in front of a crowd that small in 15 years, and that they were going to make it special. The upside is that most people there were true fans of The Cure, and Smith told everyone up in the seats to come down and join the crowd on the floor, since there was room for everyone. Anyway, it ended up being the best concert I #8217;ve ever been to. The atmosphere was incredible, there was such a communal and intimate vibe, they played their *asses* off, for nearly 4 *hours*. By the time they finished, both the band and the people in the audience were exhausted. It was something I #8217;ll never forget.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>P.A here. It #8217;s a long post but this is one thing I really wish people understood: Being a physician is one of the professions people have the most misconceptions about (along with attorneys). Probably a key reason is because physicians and lawyers are portrayed so often in film and televisions dramas where they make it seem so thrilling. Let me tell you, it isn #8217;t an easy fucking job. First of all, most of them work WAY harder than people realize. 50-60 hours a week is not uncommon. This is compounded with being on call and the subsequent terrible hours you work. Getting called in at 3:30 in the morning on a Sunday to perform an emergency appendectomy- not a lot of fun. Second (and I face this as well to a degree) the pressure of the job can *really* take a toll. To know that a mistake or an oversight on your part can really harm someone for the rest of their life, that keeps you constantly second guessing yourself in the evenings and walking through it again to try and convince yourself that whatever decision you made was absolutely the correct one. Doing that day in and day out, it builds up in you, it really does. This is especially true (at least in my case) because you can #8217;t have a normal family life if you don #8217;t learn to leave that shit at work. I mean, my wife will start complaining because I left the back door unlocked or that I promised to stop at the grocery store for tomato sauce but forgot- part of you just wants to shout  #8220;Who the fuck cares!? I watched an 8 year old kid lose both his eyes today because of a cooking accident, and you are coming at me with this trivial shit! #8221; But obviously that #8217;s unfair to your family, so whatever you dealt with at work doesn #8217;t mean it #8217;s not still your responsibility to take out the trash. Finally, it can really get to you all the suffering you see, day in and day out. Every day you are around death and serious illness, you have to deal with the distress of the families, watching a woman lose her husband or a child lose their mother. Not to mention the heart #8212;breaking and pleading looks from patients, desperate for you to take it back, to say that it #8217;s a mistake, they *don #8217;t * only have 6 months or a year to live. And I #8217;m not ignoring the fact that the pay is good, or that the job is interesting or that helping people is deeply rewarding. But those things aren #8217;t enough to make it a  #8220;great #8221; job. It #8217;s more like, those things make a nearly impossible job possible.</TEXT>

They sell for less than $100 and they are fancy enough they they can stream video via Bluetooth and you can program a spoken phrase that makes them turn off and on. And, no, I #8217;m not a creep, about a year ago I helped my sister put in a hidden camera because she suspected that her landlord was entering her apartment while she was at work, turned out it was the maintenance guy who would steal shit from the apartments.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>From the moment W. Bush came up with the idea of the TSA I knew it would be a disaster. The security should have remained the purview of the airlines and airports. At least those entities had a strong economic motivation to keep the airports and airplanes safe. Politicians from both parties lambasted the airports for lax security that led to 9/11, but that made no sense- the hijackers didn #8217;t break any security rules did they? All they had were box cutters and those weren #8217;t banned back then. Now I #8217;m not saying that I beleive in privatizing everything, but it was inevitable that replacing the private security personnel with low-payed, low-skilled federal workers would be a shit show. And maybe it #8217;s just anecdotal but it seems like private security tends to abuse their powers less than people who hold actual federal/state government authority.</TEXT>

To get a wishes, he had to fuck the genie- one fuck, one wish. So they started doing it all the time and the guy is getting everything he wanted in life. One thing after the other: new car, a boat, fancy watch etc Flash forward (in the movie) and a year later and the more stuff the guy got, the more he wanted. Each new wish he had to bang the genie, over and over and over and over, so in the end he up he fucked himself crazy. Guess the moral of the story is... well actually I #8217;m not sure *what* the moral is.</TEXT>

    <TITLE> #8220; #8221;Should I sear before or after? #8221; To answer this question, I cooked two identical roasts at the same time which were either seared before or after, and then I compared the results.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-08-20 07:47:27</DATE>
    <TEXT>I found myself wondering (as I #8217;m sure some of you have) whether it is better to sear beef/roasts before cooking in the sous vide or after. There are plenty of recipes and tutorials on either side, so I decided to do an experiment to find which method was better. **EXPERIMENT:** For this experiment I made 2 different and nearly identical 3.5 lb chuck roasts, cooked sous vide at the same time and in the same way. Both were seasoned with nothing but salt, both cooked 36 hours at 144 degrees. One of the roasts I seared before, the other I seared after after. **RESULTS:** - [Searing before] The main advantage of this method was not reflected in the roast itself, it was actually in the au jus that forms in the bag. This method produced without a doubt the best au jus I have ever had. Searing before gave the liquid in the bag a deep and delicious complexity that the liquid/au jus in the  #8220;seared after #8221; bag definitely lacked. The au jus was still good in  #8220;seared after #8221; but not *as* good. * [Searing after] The advantage of this method was (as I had expected) reflected in the outer surfaces of the roast. Allowing it to cool for 2 minutes in an ice bath and then searing after created a thin almost crispy layer on the outside, a texture similar to properly cooked bacon, and it added a burst of salty, chewy deliciousness to every bite. The outer aspect of the  #8220;seared before #8221; roast was not at all bad, it just didn #8217;t add anything to the roast. Another advantage of the  #8220;seared after #8221; approach was the way it looked. The outside of the  #8220;seared before #8221; roast had an even, almost homogenous color and appearance. The  #8220;seared after #8221; roast had a handsome variegated appearance, color contrasts between the light and darker browns that looked absolutely delicious. Conclusion: I did a third roast with both methods, meaning I seared before and then again after. This was absolutely the best approach because it resulted in a roast that had the best of both worlds. But, if for the sake of time and convenience, you decide to do only one method the conclusion is that if you care about the aus jus you should definitely use the  #8220;before #8221; method. I personally very much enjoy the au jus and the gravy I make with it, it has been one of my favorite aspects of cooking sous vide. Therefore, if I had to choose only one method this is the one I would do. Furthermore, since I #8217;m just making this for everyday family dinners and not for any special occasion, the appearance/presentation isn #8217;t necessarily a key aspect for me. However, if you enjoy the delicious outside texture and the pleasing way it contrasts with the tenderness of the inner meat, the  #8220;seared after #8221; method is right for you. This is true even more so if you don #8217;t consider the aus jus or gravy an integral part of the meal, and also if you are serving guests etc and the presentation is something you do factor in. And finally I #8217;d just like to add that what is wonderful about the sous vide is that there really isn #8217;t a bad way to make a roast. Your roast is guaranteed to be exceptional no matter what your approach, and so all this really comes down to is personal preference. Thanks for reading.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There are lots of quick ways and recipes online and most involve adding either a bit of flour or cornstarch. I personally like it thinner and simpler since the flavor is already so good, more of an au jus than a gravy. What I do is as soon as I take the roast out of the bag I pour the liquid into a small sauce pan and put it on the stove. I bring it almost to a boil and then let it simmer and reduce while I sear and finalize the roast. Then as it simmers I add to the au jus about a tablespoon of Worcestershire, a teaspoon of siracha or hot sauce, and a tablespoon of tomato paste (I buy the kind that comes in a tube which I keep in the fridge). If you don #8217;t have tomato paste, a tablespoon or 2 of ketchup is fine. If I happen to have red wine open I might as a tablespoon or two of that as well. If you want it a bit creamy then right before serving stir in 2 tablespoons of heavy cream. When the roast is done I just put it into a gravy boat and that #8217;s about it.</TEXT>

For the  #8220;after #8221; sear, I brushed the roast with a little butter before searing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This was weird as shit, though we all laugh about it now: I worked in a deli while in college and we hired this guy Greg, who was a hard worker and a nice guy but he had real issues with reliability.

He was a reasonable guy (the owner) with a good heart but when he finally got pissed off it wasn #8217;t a pretty sight. So when Greg shows up 40 minutes late, the owner comes out of the office and just lets him have it,  #8220;There are plenty of other people who want your job, you don #8217;t give a fuck about your co-workers because they get screwed every time you leave them short -handed, I #8217;ve given you plenty of chances #8221; etc etc. and finally he said,  #8220;You #8217;re fired. Leave your apron on the counter, I #8217;ll mail you your check. #8221; Greg just sits there quietly with a perplexed look and when the owner finishes, he waits a moment and then shouts at the owner and all of us,  #8220;IF I CAN DO 50 PUSH-UPS, I KEEP MY JOB!!! #8221; And, I #8217;ll bedamned if the dude didn #8217;t dropped right there on the kitchen floor and start doing push-ups:  #8220;ONE!

Or hire them to give a lecture to my office workers and pay them $90,000.

    <TEXT>LOL this reminds me of the time my mom met Clint Eastwood: Her boss is friends with Eastwood, and mom said Eastwood was coming to town for the weekend and they were all going out to dinner. I #8217;m a film buff and at the time I was a bit obsessed with Clint Eastwood #8217;s movie  #8220;Unforgiven #8221; (and I still do think it #8217;s a masterpiece and possibly the greatest western ever) so I was super excited, I pestered my mom saying  #8220;Oh! Mom, *please* tell him I #8217;m a huge fan, and how much I love  #8220;Unforgiven #8221;, and how I think it #8217;s one of the greatest films ever made! #8221; Finally, she promised she would. So the next day I spoke to her and asked about the dinner and I said  #8220;Did you tell him I #8217;m a huge fan? #8221; She said she had and I said  #8220;Yay! Thank you! So what exactly did you say? #8221; Mom said,  #8220;I said  #8216;Mr. Eastwood my son begged me to tell you that he thinks *Tombstone* is one of the greatest films ever made. #8221; I was immediately mortified and cringing inside, but I didn #8217;t want my poor mom to think she had made a fool of herself in front of Eastwood, so I just finally said,  #8220;Oh. And what did he say to that? #8221; And she goes  #8220;Oh, he laughed and said  #8216;Tell your son I said thank you very much. #8217; #8221; To this day she still doesn #8217;t know, lol.</TEXT>

The bottom line is that the super delegates were *wrong* about who was most electable candidate, and in order to have their candidate to succeed, they used their power to supress popular sentiment and subvert what should have been a fair and open nomination process. I #8217;m not a passionate Bernie fan, but I absolutely beleive he would have defeated Trump. There isn #8217;t a single doubt in my mind.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Epic hospital flip out in front of the entire hospital #8217;s board and senior administration. It #8217;s a longish story and I doubt anyone will read it but, but it #8217;s important and I #8217;ve been wanting to tell it for a while: I #8217;m a P.A. in pathology and I work closely with the people in the histology department. The supervisor of that department was someone who was extremely ambitious for advancement and *only* cared about her career, how her bosses/superiors perceived her, and who I felt had no concern or regard to for her colleagues or the patients. One day I received a left-side mastectomy on a patient and was preparing to dissect and examine it. I looked up the woman #8217;s medical records and her medical imaging and previous biopsy indicated she had *right* side breast cancer, not left. I looked for external medical records and those too confirmed: she had cancer on the right side. I thought, hmm, somethings not matching up so I looked up the surgeon #8217;s operative report and, sure enough, he describes removing the *left* breast, not the right. By now I #8217;m getting concerned, I go back and look at the hospital #8217;s surgery schedule where it lists the patient and there again it says she was scheduled for a left mastectomy. Ok now I #8217;m starting to feel a knot in my stomach. I call the physician #8217;s office and speak to his nurse, she says she *thinks* they took the left breast (surgery was the day before). I call the surgeon even though it is late in the evening (something I *never* do) and he is unreachable on a flight to Jamaica for vacation. So I start to fear the absolute worst: the hospital has removed the *wrong* breast on this poor woman. I can #8217;t describe how awful this made me feel, it was compounded by the fact that very recently I had lost a professor and important mentor to breast cancer. So I get together all the information I have gathered and go to present it to the histology supervisor, who happens to be in a meeting with hospital executives. I say, yes, it is critically urgent, so I go in the board room and I interrupt the entire meeting and proceed to explain to her in detail the entire awful and possibly catastrophic situation. After presenting all the information, she turns to me and the only thing she says is  #8220;But you #8217;re saying it #8217;s not the histology department #8217;s fault, correct? #8221; It was then I learned what people mean when they say they snapped, because I swear to god I felt something pop and for a moment completely lost sense of where I was and what was happening. I realized suddenly that the entire room was staring at me with a shocked expression, because apparently I had shouted  #8220;God *damnit* Linda, I don #8217;t give a FUCK whose fault it is right now!!! I #8217;m telling you we may have done incredible harm to this poor woman and we need to figure out RIGHT. FUCKING. NOW. if she is laying upstairs with a chest full of cancer and the wrong breast missing!!!!  #8220; It was just stunned silence in the room for like 20 seconds, no one said a word, I started feeling light headed and embarrassed, realizing what I had done, and Linda was as red as a tomato just staring at a piece of paper. They literally just ended the meeting right there, one of the hospital administrators came and got me and said  #8220;Let #8217;s go get to the bottom of this right now.  #8220;. In the end it was multiple clerical errors to blame- they *had* removed the correct breast, and that worthless bitch Linda retired without ever having advanced another inch in that hospital.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>One particular food item (potatoes) consistently fails to seal in my FoodSaver, every other item works 100% of the time. Any ideas why this is the case?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-08-27 06:57:50</DATE>
    <TEXT>My FoodSaver is only a few weeks old and has worked perfectly every time. Then I decided to do mashed potatoes, so I filled a bag with potatoes, milk, and butter. I put it in the sous vide but a few moments later noticed that there was oil floating in the water so there must have been a leak. I took the bag out, opened it and put the contents into a new bag. Then I went to vacuum and seal it, but the vacuum would not take, machine just kept pumping and pumping and air remained in the bag and a good bit of butter and milk made it into the waste tray. So I thought maybe the initial seal on this this second bag was faulty and air was being sucked through it. I checked to make sure the machine was wiped down well, the gaskets were clean and looked good etc. Put the contents (butter, milk potatoes) into *yet another* fresh bag (which was taken from a fresh new roll). Made sure the bag was big enough to have three inches clear at the top, made sure it was placed correctly and *yet again* it failed to make a vacuum. So at this point I said "screw it", I guess for potatoes it really wasn't a big deal if there was extra air in there so I went ahead and cooked them. I was worried the device was malfunctioning but when I tried to do some steaks it worked perfectly. Since then I've done a few more things and it has been perfect every time. So I go to make the potatoes again, doing it carefully and making sure everything was correct, and *yet again* the bag would not vacuum all of the air clear! But 5 minutes later I tried to do some carrots, it again worked perfectly! Is this just freaky coincidence or is there some aspect to potatoes, butter, and milk which prevents it from working properly?</TEXT>

If it actually does reduce head trauma, hey, that #8217;s great. If it doesn #8217;t that #8217;s ok too because the rule has already served it #8217;s real purpose.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes I think you #8217;re correct. I #8217;ve had a mistaken idea of how to handle that, I #8217;ve had other bags with liquid in them but it #8217;s never been an issue because this seal is usually made before the liquid makes it up that far. I think with the potatoes, perhaps there is so much air in there due to the irregular shape of the potatoes that it takes longer to pump all the air out and therefore more liquid has time to rise up into the machine and affect the seal. Thanks for the help</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I really hope someone can answer this, because it is something I #8217;ve thought about for a long time but haven #8217;t been able to phrase it well to post in /r/AskHistorians: *Did people* back then expect the future to change much? I mean, the reason *we* feel that way is because, without question, the past century saw the greatest technological leaps in the history of our species. I mean, think about it: we went from inventing the airplane to landing on the fucking *moon* in 63 years. But what about people in the 11th century? Had technology changed enough in their lifetime to give them the belief that the future would bring enormous change? Or did they think:  #8220;This is the way it has always been, and the way it will always be. #8221;? For the most part, weren #8217;t they living their lives the exact same way as their great great grandfathers? I mean, I #8217;m sure they had a notion of the Romans and the change that their civilization had heralded, or (because of religion) at least an idea of the way life was lived in biblical times. And I know it #8217;s incorrect to think of  #8220;the dark ages #8221; as backwards with no scientific progress. So I doubt the people back then felt technological advancement was stagnant. But that doesn #8217;t mean they had any notion that it was constantly and rapidly changing either. So, again, *did they* think the world would be very different for the next generation, or for the generation after that?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No, it #8217;s just speculation that has been around for the past few years. Dabo obviously has become one of the elite coaches in the country and his alma matter is Alabama. When Saban leaves I would be shocked if they *didn #8217;t* offer the job to Dabo, but it has become clear that Dabo cares a lot about what he has built here. I mean, he has built a program that can compete with Alabama year in year out. Aside from more money (and he is already very well paid) I don #8217;t think there is a whole lot that Alabama can offer that he doesn #8217;t already have here.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m a clinical laboratory scientist and one of our assistance never went to college because she got pregnant as a teenager. She decided to go back to school and get an associates degree so that she could get a raise and have a a head start to eventually enrolling at a four-year university. I thought,  #8220;Good for you. #8221; Until I learned that she had enrolled at a for-profit university. In the 18 months it took her to get the assosicates degree, she paid (and took out loans for) $32,000 in tuition. That is not a typo. THIRTY TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS to get an associates degree in a program that isn #8217;t even as good as the one at the local junior college. Calling these schools predatory is a monumental understatement. It #8217;s not that they aren #8217;t helpful, its that they are destroying people #8217;s lives. The lab did give the girl a raise though, $0.80 an hour.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There are a lot of factors really, but what it really boils down to is simply the fact that (just as I #8217;m sure happens in Europe) young people are easily persuaded to make terrible financial decisions. You probably don #8217;t realize, but these schools advertise on TV, radio etc here. They promise these people that they will have the career they always dreamed of etc. Student loans are very easy to get here, and the schools convince the young people that the degree will pay for itself. One of the really sad aspects of this is these schools target poor people, particularly working mothers. I think that in those cases young people often don #8217;t have parents or siblings that went to college so there is no one in their lives who understands the system and can explain to them why it is a terrible decision when compared to enrolling at a typical non-for-profit school.</TEXT>

Because another sad part of it is that these schools target poor people who can #8217;t afford to stop working to attend school, particularly working mothers.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I totally understand where Saban is coming from when he said he didn #8217;t want to name the QB until he had sat down with the two kids and told them face to face, I get that it was them he was thinking of. But by *not* naming the starter publicly until tonight I think ended up making it more of an issue because the national media has hardly talked about anything else for 10 days. Sometimes it #8217;s better to just announce it, get it over with, move on. On top of that, I think Saban has probably known for a while what his decision was going to be. However, by not announcing it until tonight gives the impression that he struggled with the decision until the last moment or that it was a lot closer than perhaps it really was. That will *also* I think cause the media to make a bigger deal about it than it really is.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;ve always considered wings my specialty and among friends and family it #8217;s what I #8217;m known for. I honestly didn #8217;t have high expectations for these because I #8217;ve already put so much time in  #8220;perfecting #8221; wing recipes. But this method produced wings that were *incredibly* juicy. Without a doubt the juiciest grilled or broiled wings I #8217;ve ever had. I used [this recipe](https://recipes.anovaculinary.com/recipe/sous-vide-korean-chicken-wings) with a few changes. I cooked the wings a few degrees higher (151) because I like wings that really just slide off the bone. This is difficult to do with traditional methods without drying out the wings. The glaze/sauce in that recipe is very good but for I added Sriracha and some ghee (clarified butter). Will absolutely make these again. Oh and the fried yuca is just frozen yuca from Publix. Thaw, cut into ~1/2 inch wide sticks, cover with water and bring to boil, reduce to medium and boil for 25 minutes. Drain, let cool completely, then dry at 370 degrees for ~6 minutes or until golden brown. Toss with seasoned salt or a little popcorn sauce, serve with ranch or any good dipping sauce. If you #8217;ve never had fried yuca you should try it, it #8217;s similar to French fries but creamier. Very delicious.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Really there are several key factors: First of all, it #8217;s Kansas. But to go even deeper than that, a major factor is the fact that they are Kansas. And even though most people don #8217;t realize how important this is to a team #8217;s success, the fact is that they are Kansas. Now, as you know, in recent past they have had really poor starts to the season, mainly because they are Kansas. But even later in the season they have struggled at times, especially when they are Kansas. The truth is there are a lot of quality teams out there and if you lose focus or try to look past your next opponent, that team *can*, and your team can be Kansas. And even though I #8217;m not a big statistics guy, and I think this analytical  #8220;money ball #8221; approach to team building is often just a bunch of BS, the one stat that I *do* believe is telling is the fact that (*at least* for the past 10 years) they have been Kansas.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;ve never like Lindsey Graham, but I #8217;ve always had a healthy respect for him (as an opponent) because the fact is, he is an incredibly capable and savvy politician and he *has* done some good things for our state. Together with Mccain (his closest ally) I #8217;ve always considered him one of the *least* shitty GOP politicians. In the eulogies for McCain, when Graham became emotional it was clear to me that Graham cared for the guy a great deal and that they really were very close friends. But rather than gain respect for him I dislike him more than ever for simple fact that how can you care for a friend that much and then watch Trump *shit all over him*, ridicule him for being a POW and for the physical disabilities he suffered due to years of physical torture, and not want to *go to fucking war* against the piece of shit? If anyone ever did that to a loved one of mine, I can guarantee you that I wouldn #8217;t rest until the fucker was out of office. Same with Ted Cruz. He let a man *insult his wife and father in front of millions of people*, and then goes groveling for his help. It is *sickening*.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>LOL thing is, I had made my traditional wings earlier in the day for football watching. However, I left 5 wings out in order to try this recipe, just because when I try a new recipe I like to make a small amount first just for myself. You know, to to see if the recipe is any good, or if perhaps it is good but needs an adjustment or two. So I had eaten a lot at lunch and this was basically designed to be a late night snack (for science!). Was trying something with the yuca fries too, because I read about the difference between cutting the yuca then boiling vs boiling the yuca then cutting it. It really did make a difference, cutting *then* boiling is the way to go.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Oh, that is for the yuca fries not the wings. In Latin America they use a variety of sauces depending on the country. IMO the best for yuca fries is chimichurri or any mayo-based sauce sauce (particularly a lemony or tangy one). That #8217;s what this is, it #8217;s just buttermilk ranch that I made with a little tomato paste, lime, and sriracha. Blue cheese also works very well.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I know we aren #8217;t at the level of Alabama yet, but one thing I do think Dabo #8217;s teams share with Saban is that they always beat the teams they *should* beat. Yeah, they drop a game once a year to a team, but if you #8217;ve watched the games it #8217;s usually a pretty good (if unranked) team and several times (such as with Syracuse) the opponents have played one of the best games of their lives. Clemson isn #8217;t as invincible as Alabama, but nobody is beating them unless they play a really, really good game. The contrast is really sharp with when Tommy Bowden was here: his teams had a lot of talent and could play at an extremely high level, but they also could deliver *absolute garbage* performances. The best example is probably the year they beat a really good and high-ranked Miami team and *the next week* lost to an absolutely terrible Duke team.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I understand Saban is sick of talking about it, but to a degree it is *his fault*. I mean, I totally understand where is coming from when he said he didn #8217;t want to name the QB until he had sat down with the two kids and told them face to face, I get that it was them he was thinking of with this. But by *not* naming the starter publicly until last night I think ended up making it more of an issue because it #8217;s the week before the season starts, the media and fans are in a frenzy, and for 10 days since he released the roster they #8217;ve hardly talked about anything else. Sometimes it #8217;s better to just announce it, get it over with, move on. By *not* announcing it, you make it an even bigger story. On top of that, I think Saban has probably known for a while what his decision was going to be. However, by not announcing it until the game gives the impression that he struggled with the decision until the last moment, or that the choice was a lot closer than perhaps it really was. That will *also* I think cause the media to make a bigger deal about it than it really is.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Notre Dame didn #8217;t look great either. You flip back and forth between thT game and a couple of the others and it #8217;s pretty clear where both of those programs are right now. I don #8217;t know how many seasons in a row ND has to continue to fail to live up to hype before these sports writers wake the fuck up.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Those all all great points, and like I said- I understand his motivations and I #8217;m not arguing in favor of what the media does or says or what they focus on. I #8217;m making the point that the simple reality is: keeping it a  #8220;secret #8221; makes it *more* of an issue, not less. That #8217;s just the way it is, period. It #8217;s the world we live in, it isn #8217;t going to change anytime soon, and Saban is smart enough to know that. If he makes the decision (for many good reasons, as you stated) to not announce it, he can #8217;t turn around and get pissed at the media for behaving exactly how everyone knew they would.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You preheat the broiler on high for 10 minutes until it is really hot, then you put the meat on an oven pan *right* under the broiler, like 2-3 inches, and then it #8217;s just basically an upside down grill and 1-2 minutes per side is more than enough to sear it. If you have a ceramic broiler pan, that helps because it won #8217;t get hot (and cook the side that is resting on the pan).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That part of the article appears to be incorrect, at least according to Brazilian media. If anything was spared, it was a very small amount. Basically just anything the workers could grab and run with. Also, after the firefighters claimed it was  #8220;contained #8221;, the fire started back up. Live feeds show parts of it still burning.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Exactly. That #8217;s the whole crux of a corrupt government- they use (or I should say, *abuse*) their power to maintain control and wealth, and to suppress the opposition. It it were as simple as voting them out, no country would be corrupt.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Bad administration specifically having to do with finance. I also believe that she personally was not corrupt, but if a person (even an honest person) has an administration with corrupt people in power, the end result is the same. It may not have been fair from a personal standpoint, but making the president pay a price for *not* preventing corruption is the only way to force presidents to deal with corruption. If they don #8217;t face direct consequences, why would they ever care if the people that work for them are corrupt?</TEXT>
