    <TITLE>[ATLA] Regarding the Zuko/Azula Agni Kai</TITLE>
    <DATE>2015-01-20 06:29:24</DATE>
    <TEXT>I just want to take a second to talk about this scene and how amazing it is. I think that to a lot of directors/producers, they would have seen this battle as the epic showdown between good and evil, the fiery fight between two powerful characters, and a chance to use Michael Bay-esque explosions and sound effects to get the viewers' blood pumping. Not our guys though. The ATLA creators are a special bunch, and somewhere down the line they made the decision to set the battle to beautiful and solemn music. It was a message to the audience: there is nothing to celebrate here, don't be distracted by the cool lights and explosions, and don't think of this as another simple-minded good vs evil battle that is so prevalent in our media. This was fucked up. Fucked up to the core. This was a brother fighting his younger sister to the death. This was the end result of a family filled with abuse, manipulation, and psychopathy. This was the twisted souls of two kids who never got a chance to live normal lives exploding at each other. This wasn't epic. This wasn't cool. This wasn't fun to watch. This was sad, this was cruel, and this was fucked up. So many shows would have gone the other route, throwing the explosions and the bangs and the booms all over the place. That would have been the easy choice. I have an infinite amount of respect for Bryan and Michael for going down the path that they did. Anything else would have been a disservice to the characters and to the audience.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2015-03-07 18:04:07</DATE>
    <TEXT>Lookin at you, JIDF. You think you are winning, but the only person playing the game is you. In reality, you lost the game a long time ago. You are unable to experience love. Music does not bring you joy. You have no connection to god. Nobody will ever truly love you, because nobody truly knows you as you wallow in your lies. You're no better than a computer. Basically sub human because your lack of empathy is so deep. Why did God create us? To learn and love. To overcome challenges and bring eachother up. All you bring to the table is deception after deception. Your lives are empty and violent. A hedonistic bachannalia. If I didn't hate you so much for existing I would feel sorry for you. The world.would be better if you didn't exist. And deep down inside you know it is the truth. I'm gonna go laugh at jokes now. Not a fake laugh, the kind you share with people who don't get the joke but want to look normal. I mean, I am going to go an experience real joy of a kind you can never know. If you get a kick out of downvoting me across a spectrum, realize it is the joy of a simpleton with muted emotions and an aberrant set of mirror neurons. You're like the teenage kid who beats everyone in stoplight races with his shitty acura integra - because nobody else knew they were racing. At the end of the day, what did you really accomplish? More war and suffering. If you were smart enough to know how this reality works, you might realize it is all coming back to you. You lost.

    <DATE>2015-09-16 01:01:09</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm asking because I felt that the recent remarks from President Obama provide a nice jumping point, albeit into a discussion that has already been permeating on the internet for quite some time. Here's what President Obama [had to say](http://www.vox.com/2015/9/14/9326965/obama-political-correctness) about this:  gt;It #8217;s not just sometimes folks who are mad that colleges are too liberal that have a problem. Sometimes there are folks on college campuses who are liberal, and maybe even agree with me on a bunch of issues, who sometimes aren #8217;t listening to the other side, and that #8217;s a problem too. I #8217;ve heard some college campuses where they don #8217;t want to have a guest speaker who is too conservative or they don #8217;t want to read a book if it has language that is offensive to African-Americans or somehow sends a demeaning signal towards women. I gotta tell you, I don #8217;t agree with that either. I don #8217;t agree that you, when you become students at colleges, have to be coddled and protected from different points of view. I think you should be able to  #8212; anybody who comes to speak to you and you disagree with, you should have an argument with  #8216;em. But you shouldn #8217;t silence them by saying, "You can #8217;t come because I'm too sensitive to hear what you have to say." That #8217;s not the way we learn either.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Strategy  amp; Purpose: How we're going to win this.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-01-25 05:22:04</DATE>
    <TEXT>Thank you for joining /r/PresidentBloomberg. Let's win the White House. Together, we're going to rise to the challenge and prove that the American people want competent, evidence-based reform. We're going to prove that the American people choose to reject anger and demagogue, and are capable of choosing leaders with the best grasp of the details that matter, and with the leadership skills necessary to implement them. Most of all, we're going to prove that American elections don't need to exist in the reality show universe, and that there is still a sizable portion of the country which does not want to be entertained, but wants to be informed and led. It may seem strange to be writing to a mere subreddit with only 105 subscribers with talk of winning a presidential election, but I believe that we can do it. Why? Because Americans are hungrier than ever to escape the circus. Americans want to sober up and elect the leaders who are right for the job. Americans want someone like Mayor Bloomberg, who has a proven record of success in both the private sector and the public sector, who eschews demagoguing in favor of data, who rejects divisiveness in favor of inclusion, and who leads by example. Mayor Bloomberg is famous for his use of evidence and data, rather than ideology or feelings, to support his ideas. We must adopt this approach. There are a number of things that our competitors are doing well, and we need to learn from them: * Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump speak in "we" statements. It can't be about Bloomberg, and it can't be about any individual supporter. People need to feel like they are part of a movement, and that that movement is moving in a particular direction. "We" are going to take the country in the right direction. Bloomberg is not going to take the county back, no one person can do that. We We We We We. * We need to have a singular, fixed message. Sanders is all about the income inequality. Trump is a "fuck you" to Washington. Ted Cruz is about staunch conservatism. Clinton is about her experience. We need to have a message that is simple to understand and resonates with the people. * We need to find our constituency. If a Trump or a Cruz win the republican nomination, and Sanders wins the Democratic nomination, we will be well positioned to poach voters from the middle. Trump and Cruz have faced a lot of negativity already, but Sanders hasn't yet. If the primaries start going his way, so will the negativity. We need to be prepared to poach disgruntled Clinton supporters **immediately.** The same goes for Rubio, Kasich, Bush, and Christie supporters. Hell, the same may even go for Trump and Sanders supporters. We are well positioned to exploit the weaknesses in the current field to pick up those who are astounded by the types of candidates that are currently dominating the race. * We need to highlight his successes. Balanced budgets, education reform, energy policy, etc. Most people from outside NY only know Bloomberg as the guns and soda guy. That needs to change ASAP. We need compilations of his successes, including numbers and statistics. * We need to find the fanatics. People may think that fanatic Sanders and Ron Paul supporters are annoying, and they certainly do turn people off. You know what though? The person who is willing to take time and energy out of his/her day is far more valuable than someone who is only willing to press the button at the ballot box. We have around two months until Bloomberg makes his decision. We need to have potential volunteers waiting for him. The current struggles of the Clinton campaign show how a well run, well organized, and well financed campaign will struggle when faced with a lack of passion. The Jeb! campaign demonstrates that x1000. You can't fake passion. * We need videos, infographics, and other visual material. There are a few of us who get their news almost entirely through text. Most people aren't like that. People are busy, and not everybody is interested in reading through dense policy papers or analyzing government studies in order to form opinions. Visuals are key with the average voter. This also includes this subreddit btw, I know nothing about design and my CSS skills are rudimentary. * Most voters did not read the NYT article. Most people have no idea that Bloomberg is planning a run. If he announces, it is our job to educate potential supporters about who he is, and get in front of the detractors. This country is at a historic crossroads, and we cannot afford four more years that are dominated by gridlock, anger, and delusion. We cannot afford to deny the science of climate change, we cannot afford to reject economics, and we cannot afford to further lose the trust of the American people. We need a leader who can stand up to our challenges, and who can build the coalitions and organizations needed to overcome them. We need a leader who cannot be corrupted, but who can compromise in the name of progress. We need Mike. We should not expect this to be easy. We all know how difficult an independent run will be, and we can all see how many people are rejecting the pragmatists in favor of the idealists. Still though, we have much reason to hope. I have helped many online communities grow, and I have been part of numerous political campaigns. When the groundswell is there, you can feel it, and I can feel it. We should not expect to build a grassroots evolution overnight, but I know that there are people out there who are waiting for someone like Mike. Our challenge is to find them. Let's make it happen.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2016-01-29 20:58:59</DATE>
    <TEXT>Caucuses require standing with a group of people for a long period of time, so I suspect that many husband/wife pairs will probably stick together even if they want to support different people. On the democratic side, there is a sharp gender split in Iowa polls, with a majority of men supporting Sanders, and a majority of women supporting Clinton. Since a majority of caucus voters are typically older than the population at large is, it's probably safe to assume that many voters will be attending as a husband/wife pair. So this is the question: How many couples are willing to split apart at the caucus? How many of the men who respond "Sanders" on a telephone poll will caucus with their wives for Clinton, and how many women who respond "Clinton" will join their husbands for Sanders. Is there any data on this?</TEXT>

    <DATE>2016-02-01 18:40:18</DATE>
    <TEXT>I usually avoid the super populated trails, but I had a few hours of daylight to kill and decided that I would finally get around to doing this little mountain that's supposedly really great. I was actually really impressed by the views, they exceeded my expectations, but I was appalled by some of the behavior that I witnessed: - Smoking cigars. It made the entire trail reek for about half a mile. It was not a windy day so the smell lingered. - Not wearing suitable footwear. Maybe 10% of the people that I saw had microspikes. The other 90% were sliding all over the ice. It was probably ok to be without spikes on most of the trail but a lot of it was icy and people were degrading the area by going off trail to avoid ice. I saw one group of people that were dressed in dress shoes, I have no idea how they managed to get up. - Littering. I cannot for the life of me understand why people do this. - Blasting music. Please don't. - Going up just a little bit before sundown but not having headlamps/flashlights. The flashlight on your phone is not a substitute for a proper light source! - Jeans are not a good choice, especially in the snow. Overall, I'm glad to see people hiking up a mountain. It's great that people who probably don't have much experience are getting out. A few bad choices though, can put yourself in danger or can lessen the experience for others. Just be cognizant.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've known Sanders for a long time, probably more than a decade longer than most Sanders supporters. Even when I've disagreed with him, I've always believed that he was an honest man whose heart was in the right place. Maybe it's just the heat of the campaign, but the vitriol that has come out of his mouth and the mouths of his paid employees is really turning me sour to him. The pathetic way in which he latches onto right wing attacks, the complete disregard that he has for respected economists, the way in which he threw Planned Parenthood and Human Rights Campaign under the bus, the not-so-subtle racism with the whole Killer Mike thing, etc. I liked him a lot, but now, I've lost my respect for the man.</TEXT>

It's time that we had a woman in the White House! It's time that we get a progressive in the White House! It's time that we get a competent leader, the most experienced presidential candidate in decades, if not ever, and a true hero of the progressive movement! Who else has stood as the standard bearer of the liberal movement for as long as she has? Nobody! Nobody has faced the attacks, nobody has faced the criticism, and nobody has faced the hate that she has. But at the end of the day, she's still standing. Eight years after South Carolina began her historic defeat at the hands of Barack Obama, she went on to win the state by almost fifty points! Talk about history! So if you want a progressive, if you want a champion, if you want a fighter, and, most of all, if you want a woman, it's time to join the Clinton Campaign Train!!!!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Hillary Clinton will be declared the Presumptive Nominee the moment that New Jersey is called.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-05-18 15:27:40</DATE>
    <TEXT>The numbers from last night aren't completely final, but right now we're looking at Clinton having roughly 1771 pledged delegates and 525 superdelegates, or 2296 total delegates. This puts her at only 87 delegates away from 2,383. Between now and June 7, there are only two contests: Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. Between these two, there are 67 delegates. Let's be conservative and say that she only manages to win 25 of them, which is less than she will probably actually win. If she only manages to get 25 delegates, she will need 62 delegates in order to win the nomination. New Jersey has 126 delegates, so the winner automatically gets 63 of them. If Hillary wins New Jersey, the nomination will be over, and she will be declared the presumptive nominee. This is without even considering any results from NM or CA, where she should gain many more delegates (and more than enough to earn the majority of pledged delegates).</TEXT>

    <DATE>2016-08-18 15:59:11</DATE>
    <TEXT>EDIT: I forgot to mention in the title that I also want to do Colden. I don't have a lot of backpacking or ADK experience, but we are both strong hikers. Right now the plan is to start at the Loj, hike up Algonquin/Iroquois/Wright on the first day, sleep near the Beaver Point shelter, and then the next day go around Lake Colden to hike up Mount Colden. And then either continue on towards Lake Arnold or doubling back to go over Avalanche Pass and continue on to Marcy Dam. It kind of looks like you can also include TableTop in this trip, but I think that that's too ambitious. What do you think? Is this a solid plan? Any advice for someone who has not backpacked in the ADKs, other than bring a bear can?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>One thing that I would like to see in the next debate: When Trump inevitably gets around to his, ["we shouldn't have plans to defeat ISIS because real Generals don't tell the enemy what they're doing" ](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/782728287718150144) bullshit, I'd like to see Hillary respond something like:  gt;First of all Donald, outlining a broad strategy to defeat ISIS is not the same as announcing specific tactics. There is a difference between announcing and offensive and announcing tactical targets. You would know that if you studied. But second of all, what Donald just said gets to one of the fundamental differences between the two of us. I have prepared for this job. I have studied the issues, and I have come up with the best possible plans to make America stronger and to make Americans richer. Meanwhile, what has Donald done? He has conned his way here by pretending to have secret plans, just like he pretends to be a great businessman.

    <TEXT>Yes. You're witnessing their post 2016 strategy. Trump never existed. Forget Trump. He never existed. Donald Trump was never the Presidential nominee. Our party never chose Donald Trump in the primary. Everyone was on vacation in 2016. Hey, Pence did an OK job. There were no presidential debates. The only debate was the VP debate. Donald Trump was never the nominee.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2016-10-05 17:13:34</DATE>
    <TEXT>When Trump inevitably gets around to his, ["we shouldn't have plans to defeat ISIS because real Generals don't tell the enemy what they're doing" ](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/782728287718150144) bullshit, I'd like to see Hillary respond something like:  gt;First of all Donald, outlining a broad strategy to defeat ISIS is not the same as announcing specific tactics. There is a difference between announcing an offensive and announcing tactical targets. You would know that if you studied. But second of all, what Donald just said gets to one of the fundamental differences between the two of us. I have prepared for this job. I have studied the issues, and I have come up with the best possible plans to make America stronger and to make Americans richer, like my infrastructure plan and my college compact plan. Meanwhile, what has Donald done? He has conned his way here by pretending to have secret plans, just like he pretends to be a great businessman. Let me tell you something, great businessmen don't repeatedly go bankrupt and require $30million cash infusions from their siblings. Great businessmen don't lose $1billion operating casinos during economic booms. Great businessmen don't lie and cheat their way out of paying the small businesses, the mom and pop shops, who helped them along the way, not to even mention the tax obligations that he has avoided.  gt;The reason why Donald does not want to outline a plan to defeat ISIS is the same as the reason why he does not want to release his tax returns: Because if Donald was forced to show the American people who he really is, behind his flashy tricks and his blustery rhetoric, they would see the truth, and that is that he is a fraud.

The discrepancy with the 2004 number is actually probably centered around people who watched online, I'd bet that in total they drew very similar audiences.</TEXT>

But I have never once, not a single time, heard somebody brag about raping a woman in there.

    <TEXT>I do think it's true that he managed to exceed the lowest expectations that have ever been set for a presidential debate. He managed not to have a total meltdown like last time. But if last time his challenge was was prove that he could face her in a policy debate (which he completely failed at), this time his challenge was to somehow move beyond the rape tape, which he also completely failed at. "Locker room banter" is not going to cut it because the entire country knows that what he described in that tape was sexual assault, not just a brag about "oh look at me I have sex with women" which miiight have been excusable. I mean, you have parents who need to explain to their kids what "grab them by the pussy" means. And we all know that there are more tapes coming. He managed to halt the collapse for a few hours, maybe even a couple of days, but this isn't the end of it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi, I am just wondering if you have ever been to the Golden Wok in Red Hook? I live in the district and this is a big issue for me. On a more fundamental level, I'm kind of asking, you're not from the district. This is a diverse district that is part urban, part rural. It includes New Paltz, and then places like Tivoli, Shandanken, and Elizaville. What right does a carperbagger have to claim a mandate to represent it? I am less interested in how you have been endorsed by Bernie, and more interested in how you can actually represent the people of a district that you don't live in. Edit: Downvote all you want people, but this is a real issue in the district. Chris Gibson, who she is running to replace, really did work to be part of the community. Like the Gibsons or not, they know the district like the backs of their hands. I am asking, can Teachout claim the same?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You two are using the same terminology to refer to different things. CNN/ORC conducted what is known as a "snap poll" last night, where a pre-chosen sample is polled in order to get an immediate reaction. These are generally not considered to be as good as other polls, but they at least try to be. The other thing that are sometimes (incorrectly) referred to as snap-polls are the "online polls" that some websites conduct. These are just, simply put, complete garbage. They only exist to draw clicks to the website, not to poll anyone.</TEXT>

He later reiterated the point, pounded the table and said,  #8220;which is okay. #8221; He added,  #8220;I wish I wasn #8217;t. #8221; What the hell is a skin man? Just one more thing to point out, it isn't exactly like HuffPo is a bastion of journalism. If they managed to get their hands on one of these transcripts, they weren't very hard to find and others have them as well. This leak is a warning to the remaining republicans on board the Trump train: Run.</TEXT>

I mean the FBI is telling me there's never been anything like it. You have 33,000 emails, 33,000 emails, and not once, not once -- and by the way, let's not be politically correct, ok? The emails were released because of Benghazi. Ben-gha-zi folks, ok? And not once, not once did they even say who our real enemy is - Radical Islamic Terrorisim. Barack Obama refuses to say it. Everyone's asking me, why doesn't he say it? Three words, Radical Islamic Terrorism. Why doesn't he say it? And maybe the answer is, maybe the answer is that there is something else going on.

    <TEXT>Yes, because there isn't enough polling data to move it. But there was a poll today essentially showing Clinton, Trump, and McMullin all tied at 25, the entire Utah GOP establishment pulled support from Trump, the Mormon Church's official newspaper called for Trump to step down and began broadcasting pro-Hillary videos, Trump got just 14% of the vote in the Utah Caucus, and pretty much everyone on the ground there is reporting that there is a widespread revolt against Trump.

    <TEXT>+4 in 4way, +5 in 2way. Obama up 9 in hypothetical match up vs Trump (yet another data point as to why his "I'm running against Obama, she's another four years" strategy makes no sense. 39% say Rubio standing by Trump makes them less likely to vote for him, but my guess is that the Venn diagram of that 39% and Murphy's 38% is a circle. Rubio up 6. Floridians don't love him but they dislike Murphy more. By a 63-22 margin, Trump is not a good roll model for children. 46% think that they pay more in taxes than Trump, only 35% think he is as rich as he claims to be. Most people do not think Trump respects women, and most do not think it is fair to hold Hillary accountable for Bill's behavior (yet another data point in the, 'Trump's strategy makes no sense' bucket.)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well it's more of an oversimplification than anything. The relevant text states:  gt;"The electors shall meet in their respective states, and vote by ballot for two persons, of whom one at least shall not be an inhabitant of the same state with themselves." So this means that, if it was a Clinton/Gillibrand ticket, New York's 29 electors would be able to cast a vote for Clinton as president but not for Gillibrand as VP, or vice versa. So you could theoretically have a situation in which Clinton is elected president but her running mate is not elected as VP if it's a close race. So while no it isn't technically forbidden, it's a bad idea on a practical level.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Four years ago, Mitt Romney and the Republicans were mocking Obama as weak on Russia. Today, they are willing to nominate someone whose number one concern regarding Putin is whether or not his scrotum has been washed recently. More than anything else, this election has shown just how completely full of shit Republican voters are. Between evangelicals who are constantly crying about "family values" yet want to vote for a guy who rapes women and wants to bang his own daughter, and the "Democrats are too weak on foreign policy" voters who are lined up behind someone who knows absolutely nothing about geopolitical strategy but has an instinctive hard-on for authoritarians, these people are completely and utterly full of shit.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I always say something to the effect of:  gt;Good. You shouldn't trust the cable news channels, they are all more interested in getting ratings and less interested in actually educating people. If you watch CNN, you will be dumber than you were if you hadn't watched it at all. Thankfully though, there is still some good journalism left. Newspapers like the WSJ (republican), Economist (conservative by American definitions) and the NYTimes offer some of the best reporting available. I think that we can both agree that there are sources of news beyond the big cable networks that offer real reporting and sane analysis. But really there's no point because to most of these people, that means that they get their news from Infowars, Breitbart, and Fox News (which despite being the most watched cable channel in America is somehow not the "Mainstream Media.")</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There's no real point because there's no real scenario in which those states make the difference. Would you rather have the comfort of knowing that you're going to win, or decide to be risky and make a bet on a landslide? It's easy to say now that they should have bet on a landslide early on, but just remember how people were feeling a month ago when the polls were close.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I mean, beyond this, it's not like you can launch a major offensive against a city of two million people by surprise. Trump may not know this because he thinks that it's a video game, but it isn't like IS doesn't notice as ISF and Peshmerga attack villages near Mosul, fire artillery at Mosul, drones fly over Mosul, etc. He does not understand that there is a difference between announcing a long-term strategic offensive and announcing tactical targets. If we were saying, "we're going to bomb this building on Friday," that would be subject to legitimate criticism. But announcing the start of a major offensive? Give me a break. Additionally, we want to announce the assault because we are trying to encourage civilian populations (many of whom are armed or could access weapons) to rise up against IS. It also lowers morale for many rank and file IS fighters to know that certain death is coming. But of course, Donald doesn't know any of this because he doesn't know anything.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Vote for Hillary. First, consider the state of the race right now. Polls are starting to show that there are three candidates polling between 25-30%. Yes, Hillary is at the low end of that. But when you have three candidates polling at such a low spread in such a volatile race (three party races are inherently volatile), there's a lot of room for surprises. So even though she is polling in third, she can win. Second, think about who you prefer to win, Trump or McMullin. Well, this is ultimately a race to 270, not a race to see who wins by more. The only way that a McMullin win actually helps Hillary is if Trump gets between 270-275 Electoral votes. Swapping Utah to McMullin in this scenario gets Trump to 264-269. In this case, the race goes back to the House. Now, I have no idea what happens next, but... not good. Ultimately, Utah is unlikely to matter in the race. No offense, but it's just highly unlikely that it's a tipping point for either candidate. It's better to vote for Clinton and to give her a better shot at winning than it is to vote for McMullin whose victory would be symbolic but ultimately not helpful.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ok, so as /u/DeSoulis mentioned, the Chinese were not allies by the time that 1979 rolled around. There are a number of reasons for this, but before I dive into answering your question in a more detailed way, just consider this: While China and Russia share a long border, the vast majority of Chinese people live near the east coast on the Pacific, and a vast majority of Russian people live on the western edge of Russia, near Europe. While yes, these two are neighbors, Beijing and Moscow are over 3,500 miles apart. They have different cultures, different languages, vastly different histories (and the history that they do share is not very pleasant), different religions, and, even today, very different strategic aims. While the two have found common cause in the past, such as a brief common desire to promote communism, the two are simply not natural allies. Both are interested in being the head honchos in their own worlds. Mao did not want to be subservient to Stalin or Khrushchev, and Stalin+other Soviet leaders were really ticked off about being dragged into China's conflicts in Asia. In the 1950s, the Soviets were not very happy about almost going to nuclear war over the tiny islands of Quemoy and Matsu, which the Soviets simply did not care about. The Chinese were also very upset over the Korean War, but that's a whole other can of worms. So that's kind of the broader strategic issue between the USSR and China. Now let's go into some recent areas in which the two countries had been at odds: -In 1964, China had a short war with India, which although not aligned with the USSR, was much closer to the USSR than it was to the US or China. In some respects, this was viewed as something of a proxy war between the PRC and the USSR. -In 1971, China began opening up to the United States. This was (correctly) seen in the USSR as China's way of throwing its weight around to back the US against the USSR in the cold war. -China and the Soviets were at odds throughout the entirety of the Vietnam War. Despite the fact that all three were communists, China DID NOT LIKE that the North Vietnamese were so close to the USSR, because China (correctly) felt that they could later be used against China and its allies. -In 1978 (it started a bit earlier but really broke out in 1979) the Communist Vietnamese attacked and occupied Chinese-aligned Cambodia. China interpreted this as a Soviet-designed strategy to encircle China. -In 1979, China invaded Vietnam due to the occupation of Cambodia. This further deteriorated Sino-Soviet relations. So to step back, in the span of a few decades we see what are interpreted as Sino-Soviet proxy wars in India, Vietnam, and Cambodia. You also have a massive Soviet troop presence, with occasional skirmishes, on China's northern border. In China and elsewhere, many people considered the invasion of Afghanistan to be part of a larger strategy to attack Pakistan and to achieve conquest of a warm water port on the Indian Ocean - long considered a major objective of Russian grand strategy. Take a look at a contemporary map and there is a simple conclusion that you would draw if you were a leader in Beijing - that you were being encircled. Given that context, I hope that you see why it would make sense for the PRC to assist the Mujihadeen.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Holy shit I just read the Newsweek article, and it all made sense to me. It all clicked. One of the big stories of this election has been how easily Trump has forced the GOP to abandon the ideals it has been promoting for decades in order to accommodate Trump. People are flummoxed as to how this is the case. But it all makes sense. Russia has spent literally centuries learning how to play uneducated ignorant people like a fiddle, how to turn them paranoid and then turn the paranoia into a loyalty that matters more than any idea or value ever could. And the Republican base is the perfect target for this. The Republican party, at the core, is no different from the Russian populace in terms of education and ideals. It is uneducated people scared of a changing world, desperately trying to usher in a glorious past that never really existed because they feel besieged by the modern world. The Republican Party spent the first six years of the Obama presidency chastising him for being too soft on Russia. Sometimes they were right. Just four years ago, I was amazed that Obama mocked Romney for calling Russia our greatest geopolitical foe. "The 80s called, they want their foreign policy back" honestly should have sunk him, but for some reason democrats rallied around him. But now look at them.  #8220;The creatures outside looked from pig to man, and from man to pig, and from pig to man again; but already it was impossible to say which was which. #8221;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Excerpt from something that I wrote in April 2015:  gt;Hundreds of refugees died in the Mediterranean after a packed vessel travelling from Libya to Italy capsized on April 18. Dozens more were killed in similar but smaller incidents that weekend. This incident was a focal point in Europe #8217;s refugee crisis, in which Europe is struggling to deal with the largely Muslim residents fleeing the growing instability at home. Since there does not seem to be any solution in sight to conflicts in Libya, Nigeria, Syria, and Iraq, among others, it is likely that the pace of refugees will not slow. In a separate incident, another boat carrying refugees made the news after details emerged of an incident on another Libya-Italy refugee voyage. On this boat, Muslim refugees took it upon themselves to single out and throw 12 Christian refugees overboard because of their religious beliefs. This followed the revelation of two mass slaughters of Christians at the hands of IS-affiliated militias in Libya.  gt;I #8217;ll keep this short because I #8217;ve already used 2,300 words on Middle Eastern issues, but it #8217;s worth bringing this up because this issue, perhaps even more than the Greek Financial issues, is one of the biggest factors that could cause the EU to fail. The influx of Muslim immigrants, combined with the perception that Muslim immigrants bring crime or illiberal ideas, leads directly to the rise of the right wing.  gt;Typically, migrants and refugees from the Middle East or North Africa pass through Bulgaria, Italy, or Greece. Bulgaria is not part of the European Schengen Free Travel Zone, but Italy and Greece are. This means that once a migrant lands safely on a Greek island, they can travel through Europe without seeing any type of border patrol or customs officers. The structure of the Eurozone though, means that migrants are the financial responsibility of the country that first receives them. This puts significant strain on southern European countries like Greece and Italy, both of which have quite bad financial situations, so those countries have an incentive not to make any attempt to process the majority of migrants who will then move toward richer countries like France, Germany, the Netherlands, and Sweden, where the migrants can gain access to better public systems and better lives. This then encourages more immigration as news of the safety of the Greek or Italian landing points spread, and as the infrastructure to shuttle migrants north grows.  gt;France for example, has the second highest per capita population of Muslims in the EU (the first being Bulgaria), and the right-wing Front Nationale (FN) did alarmingly well in the recent French local elections. Backed by growing Islamaphobia and catalysed by the recent Charlie Hebdo attacks, the FN came in second place with 25% of the vote. While this did not translate into many actual seats in government, it does show that the FN has found mainstream success by transforming itself from an anti-Semitic party into an Islamaphobic party, and similar results will be mirrored elsewhere in Europe. Many of the European right-wing parties are explicitly anti-EU, and their rise is testing the abilities of national governments to navigate through the Euro crisis. Of particular concern is the rise of the right-wing UK Independence Party in the UK, which is a driving force behind the referendum on EU membership that the UK is planning to hold in 2017. Many of Europe #8217;s far right parties are covertly funded by Russia, which sees these movements as an easy way to degrade the unity and power of  #8216;the west. #8217; What we are seeing is the degradation of the EU, sparked by the Euro Crisis, fueled by immigration, and supported by Russia. This raises a lot of big questions about the future of the West, about the attraction of liberal democracy, and about the future demographics of Europe. Whether or not Europe is able to come together and choose to save and build the EU, and how it deals with the growing Muslim demographics, may very well be among the defining issues of the era.</TEXT>

Romney did not say that Russia was some super existential threat that was on the verge of undermining the US or NATO or something. He said that they were our biggest geopolitical foe. Transport yourself back to 2012, and ask yourself, who is our greatest geopolitical foe? China? No. Iran? No. North Korea? No. Al-Qaeda? Ha. I do agree though, and did say at the time, that it's generally not a good idea for a party nominee to be openly hostile towards a foreign power that we are not in a state of open hostility towards, best to be a diplomat and to keep it under wraps a bit.</TEXT>

The rise of the HDP was largely responsible for Erdogan failing to get a simple majority in the July 2015 general election, and he has definitely held a grudge since. He also views them (not erroneously) as being allied with the PKK, and the Turkey-PKK war remains open, and is at risk of exploding inside of Syria.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Let's say that you have group A and group B, in a land that has a limited supply of a necessary resource, let's call it water. 67% of the water is in land controlled by A, and 33% is in land controlled by B. At the start of a fifty year period, both groups have 100 people. Because they have more water, A's population balloons into 200 people, but group B's rises more slowly to 120 because of a lack of resources. Oh no, here comes a drought! The drought hits A the hardest, but it hits B as well, so that both of their water supplies are at a pre-drought level but A's is far worse. Now A has only 40% of the water, but it has 63% of the people! And neither side has enough water to support their populations! If you are the leader of group A would you: 1. Wait around for a good chunk of your people to die? or 2. Use your superior population to invade B for the water resources?</TEXT>

I am not in any way implying that she would be alive today had the ambulance reached her, I am just saying that none of what you said changes the fact that it is absolutely heinous for an ambulance to be prevented from reaching a sick person.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well yes, but a lot of fighting does come down to resources in the end. Not necessarily in the "x valley has this resource, so we need to grab it now," but more in the "x valley is a strategic corridor that we need to defend so as to ensure that group B does not acquire the metals on y mountain, because they could use those metals to raise enough revenue to move in on our water resources." The fact is that no matter what, in the end there are limited resources. It is simply the law of nature. Whether that resource is soil, water, oil, rare earth elements, or whatever, the very simple fact is that there isn't enough to go around. When there are enough resources to go around, populations explode, which ensures scarcity. It is a law of nature.</TEXT>

Yes he got arrested as a teen, where was his interaction with the black community as a congressman and senator? 2. Putting Cornell West and Killer Mike at the center of black outreach (are you kidding me?). 3. General refusal to talk about black issues, instead trying to pivot away from race and towards economic issues. Black people generally feel that the notion that poor blacks have more in common with poor whites than they do with rich blacks is something that only an ignorant white person could possibly believe. 4. Repeatedly criticizing President Obama. 5. Going after the Clintons for the 90s crime bill stuff, when the general sentiment in the black community was that, yes mistakes were made, but that was a very dark period in the black community and at least the Clintons tried to do something about it. Also, Bernie voted for it. 6. The fact that Clinton had long and deep connections with black political leaders, and Bernie didn't.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;As is happening in battleground states across the country, Clinton's amassing a large lead in early voting in each of these states. Among those who have already cast their ballots she's up 52-41 in Colorado, 57-36 in Michigan, and 63-32 in Virginia. Trump will be counting on a very strong performance on Election Day to have any chance at taking Michigan and Virginia, and he's probably pretty much already lost Colorado given the volume of early voting there. FWIW, this is why some of us are so hungry for oppo today. If Clinton is dominating the early vote, suppressing same-day turnout is a good thing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I honestly think that what happened to Nate was that he decided that more data was always better, so adding shitty polls (and weighing) from places like Google Consumer Surveys that are qualitatively bullshit, not even necessarily biased to one side, just bad, was better than cherry picking and not adding. In theory this would be counterbalanced by a deluge of good polls, but for various reasons that have been discussed here there aren't as many high quality polls this cycle as there have been in other cycles, and it's become easier to conduct shitty polls, so the shitty polls are having too much of an effect.</TEXT>
