    <DATE>2014-11-03 21:26:07</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm on my second go round of reading a book for ever letter of the alphabet by author's last name. I'm all finished except for the letter V. Last time around, I read Cutting for Stone by Abraham Verghese. But I'm stuck looking for another quality book. Anyone with a good suggestion, I'm all ears!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Can anyone recommend a movie derivative of La Jetee by Chris Marker?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2014-11-22 16:00:29</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm hoping someone can help me out here. I'm looking for movies that were inspired by or are very similar to the movie La Jetee by Chris Marker. I'm looking for moves that have a similar construction in that they're comprised entirely - or almost entirely - of still shots. I'm more in the market for a movie made with photo stills as opposed to illustrated stills, but I'll check out anything. Thanks in advance!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>One time, we were tarring the roof of a building. And one of the inmates, an aloof guy who was in for murder, overheard a few of the guards talking. He walked up to the head guard, a real hard screw, and asked him, "Do you trust your wife?" You see, this prisoner was a banker, and he knew some great loopholes. So he offered to help the screw out with his money issues by using his wife as a go-between. Well, to make a long story short, he ended up saving the guard a ton of money and started doing his taxes. Within a short time, he was doing the taxes of every guard there, even the warden's. As a reward, we all got to spend part of our last day on that roof drinking beer. Makes a man feel more like a man, or so I once heard someone say. Don't know what happened to the dude as he escaped and they never found him. I can only hope he's on some beach somewhere sanding down a boat.</TEXT>

It's pretty popular in bars around here in MD, but when I tell people I like it, they always think I'm talking about the kind you play on the ground (the kind old people play). It's a great bar game, and something my buddy and I have gotten pretty good at. Won a Baltimore championship couple years back.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A man gets a call that his wife is giving birth. He races to the hospital, and waits eagerly in the waiting room. Eventually the doctor comes out with an odd look on his face. "What's wrong doctor? Is my baby ok? Is it a boy or a girl?" The doctor looks up at him. "It's the damndest thing. Your baby is a miracle, sir," he says. The doctor leads the man into a room, where the baby is laying soundly, cuddled up in a blanket. "Your baby can float. It's amazing! Watch!" The doctor lifts the child up a couple inches from the bed, then drops it. Nothing happens. "What are you doing?" says the man. "Let me get my child and leave!" "No, no, no! You have to see this. It did it before!" He picks up the child again, but this time drops it onto the floor. The baby hits the ground with a solid thud. Totally distraught, with tears in his eyes, the man pleads for the doctor to stop. "No, no, no! He totally did it! You HAVE to see this. It's a miracle!" The doctor picks the child up off the ground, and throws it out the window. The baby falls several stories and explodes on a car! "OH MY GOD! WHAT HAVE YOU DONE!?" screams the man. "Don't worry about it. The baby was a still-born. Haha! You should have seen the look on your face!"</TEXT>

He is a Greek singer, model and occasional actor, who rose to fame after appearing on Greek talent show Dream Show aired by Alpha TV in 2006.

    <TEXT>This question gets posted *all the time.* But the short answer is that it's psychological marketing. Having prices like $14.95 look/sound better than saying $15. And the effect is magnified the more you walk your way up the scale. $14,995 sounds much better than $15,000 even though it's only $5 less.

    <TEXT>Well, lobster didn't used to be a "fancy" food. It used to be an edible fit only for servants or prisoners. Lobster was so plentiful, they would just wash up on the shore. In fact, during their first months, the Pilgrims were forced to eat lobster because they couldn't sustain themselves otherwise, and it actually *embarrassed* them to do so. But to answer your question, supply and demand creates the high price like most anything else. As lobster worked it's way up the class chart, the amount of lobster needed spiked. So it became pricier. Like anything else, the lobster market experiences dips and peaks... and this is why you'll see "market pricing" on many menus for lobster.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Tough to get something and not have it seem like ass-kissing. Unless you do things like that reasonably often, I don't think you'll have the entire group hemming and hawing over you. Really, the best thing you can do is just go out with a buddy, grab a drink, and stay the F away from gal's night.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The Mighty Ducks. Gordon Bombay is a hypocritical bastard. He preaches the philosophy that "winning isn't everything" *originally.* That is, until he finds out the kick-ass player from the other team should actually be on his own squad. Suddenly Gordon does everything he can to make sure the good kid is on his own team so they can win. Loved the movie as a kid, but damn if Bombay isn't a real jerk.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In 1883, Henry Ziegland broke off a relationship with his girlfriend who, out of distress, committed suicide. The girl #8217;s enraged brother hunted down Ziegland and shot him. Believing he had killed Ziegland, the brother then took his own life. In fact, however, Ziegland had not been killed. The bullet had only grazed his face, lodging into a tree. It was a narrow escape. Years later, Ziegland decided to cut down the same tree, which still had the bullet in it. The huge tree seemed so formidable that he decided to blow it up with dynamite. The explosion propelled the bullet into Ziegland #8217;s head, killing him.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>1972 Olympics Basketball Gold Medal Game: With the US team trailing the Soviet Union, 49-48, Doug Collins was fouled hard and awarded two foul shots. Collins drained the first, and during the second, the controversy began. As Collins began his shooting motion, the scorer #8217;s table horn sounded. Play wasn #8217;t stopped, Collins made the shot, and the US took a 50-49 lead. The Soviets, however, insisted that that they had called a timeout before Collins' second shot, and assistant coach Sergei Bashkin stormed on the court. Timeouts in Olympic rules at the time dictated that timeouts could not be called after the second free throw, and the Soviets should have been given a technical foul after Bashkin ran on the court. The game, meanwhile, had been stopped given the disurbance after the Soviets had inbounded the ball. The referees conferred, did not grant the timeout (though called no technical on the Soviets) and ordered the play be run again, with three seconds on the clock. But only one second was actually put on the clock and the game ended prematurely, amid celebrations from the US players. The proper three seconds was then put on the clock, leading to a full-court pass and one of the most devastating layups in the history of American sports.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You come to the counter. I am on the phone with a drunk dude who wants the phone number to the grocery store next door. After I instruct him on the virtues of 411, you tell me your doctor was to phone in your prescription to me. Your doctor hasn't, and you're unwilling to wait until he does. Being in a generous mood, I call your doctors office and am put on hold for 5 minutes, then informed that your prescription was phoned in to my competitor on the other side of town. Phoning the competitor, I am immediately put on hold for 5 minutes before speaking to a clerk, who puts me back on hold to wait for the pharmacist. Your prescription is then transferred to me, and now I have to get the 2 phone calls that have been put on hold while this was being done. Now I return to the counter to ask if we've ever filled prescriptions for you before. For some reason, you think that "for you" means "for your cousin" and you answer my question with a "yes", whereupon I go the computer and see you are not on file. The phone rings. You have left to do something very important, such as browse through the monster truck magazines, and do not hear the three PA announcements requesting that you return to the pharmacy. You return eventually, expecting to pick up the finished prescription..... The phone rings. ......only to find out that I need to ask your address, phone number, date of birth, if you have any allergies and insurance coverage. You tell me you're allergic to codeine. Since the prescription is for Vicodin I ask you what exactly codeine did to you when you took it. You say it made your stomach hurt and I roll my eyes and write down "no known allergies" You tell me...... The phone rings. .....you have insurance and spend the next 5 minutes looking for your card. You give up and expect me to be able to file your claim anyway. I call my competitor and am immediately put on hold. Upon reaching a human, I ask them what insurance they have on file for you. I get the information and file your claim, which is rejected because you changed jobs 6 months ago. An asshole barges his way to the counter to ask where the bread is. The phone rings. I inform you that the insurance the other pharmacy has on file for you isn't working. You produce a card in under 10 seconds that you seemed to be unable to find before. What you were really doing was hoping your old insurance would still work because it had a lower copay. Your new card prominently displays the logo of Nebraska Blue Cross, and although Nebraska Blue cross does in fact handle millions of prescription claims every day, for the group you belong to, the claim should go to a company called Caremark, whose logo is nowhere on the card. The phone rings. A lady comes to the counter wanting to know why the cherry flavored antacid works better than the lemon cream flavored antacid. What probably happened is that she had a milder case of heartburn when she took the cherry flavored brand, as they both use the exact same ingredient in the same strength. She will not be satisfied though until I confirm her belief that the cherry flavored brand is the superior product. I file your claim with Caremark, who rejects it because you had a 30 day supply of Vicodin filled 15 days ago at another pharmacy. You swear to me on your mother's'.... The phone rings. .......life that you did not have a Vicodin prescription filled recently. I call Caremark and am immediately placed on hold. The most beautiful woman on the planet walks buy and notices not a thing. She has never talked to a pharmacist and never will. Upon reaching a human at Caremark, I am informed that the Vicodin prescription was indeed filled at another of my competitors. When I tell you this, you say you got hydrocodone there, not Vicodin. Another little part of me dies. The phone rings. It turns out that a few days after your doctor wrote your last prescription, he told you to take it more frequently, meaning that what Caremark thought was a 30-day supply is indeed a 15 day supply with the new instructions. I call your doctor's office to confirm this and am immediately placed on hold. I call Caremark to get an override and am immediately placed on hold. My laser printer has a paper jam. It's time for my pharmacy tech to go to lunch. Caremark issues the override and your claim goes though. Your insurance saves you 85 cents off the regular price of the prescription. The phone rings. At the cash register you sign.... The phone rings. ......the acknowledgement that you received a copy of my HIPAA policy and that I offered the required OBRA counseling for new prescriptions. You remark that you're glad that your last pharmacist told you you shouldn't take over the counter Tylenol along with the Vicodin, and that the acetaminophen you're taking instead seems to be working pretty well. I break the news to you that Tylenol is simply a brand name for acetaminophen and you don't believe me. You fumble around for 2 minutes looking for your checkbook and spend another 2 minutes making out a check for four dollars and sixty seven cents. You ask why the tablets look different than those you got at the other pharmacy. I explain that they are from a different manufacturer. Tomorrow you'll be back to tell me they don't work as well. Now imagine this wasn't you at all, but the person who dropped off their prescription three people ahead of you, and you'll start to have an idea why.....your prescription takes so damn long to fill. A year and a half late, but a promise kept. I feel better about myself already. SOURCE: http://drugmonkey.blogspot.com/2006/08/i-realize-today-ive-done-you.html</TEXT>

While you will receive information that could aid you in attaining your goal (whether it be rock-hard abs, earning $500k in the stock market, or becoming a Viking in the bedroom), the one weird trick is always a gimmick. For instance, the "one weird trick" to losing 50 lbs. might be portion control. Or the "trick" to getting rich quick might be penny stocks.

Third, if you're placing these ads where people will see them, you want a WAY better conversion rate than the 1% you're quoting.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm sure you know the objective is to score more goals than the other team, but here are some other facts: * A game is divided into (3) 20-minute periods * There are five (5) lines on the ice, two (2) goal lines (both at the end of the ice), two (2) blue lines, separating the offensive/defensive zones from the neutral zone, and the center red line. * Hockey is played with six (6) players on the ice for each team; five (5) skaters, one (1) goaltender. * There are an unlimited amount of substitutions and they can happen at any time; during play and/or a stoppage of play; except when the defensive team ices the puck. * Icing is when the defending team shoots the puck down the ice, without touching another player, across two red lines, first one being the red centre line and the second being the goal line. The opposing team must touch the puck before the team who iced the puck, or the call will become void. * If the game is still tied at the end of regulation, there is a sudden death overtime period; meaning, if a goal is scored during this period, the game is over. * If the game is still tied after the overtime period, a shootout ensues. Each team will have three (3) shooters. The team with the best out of three shots will win the game. If after the three shooters the game is still tied, its moves to a sudden death shootout; meaning the next shootout goal wins (if the team who chooses to shoot first scores, the team that shoots second has the chance to redeem themselves, if they miss, the game is over). * Some common penalties: Hooking, slashing, delay of game, interference, goaltender interference, tripping, roughing, elbowing, boarding, cross checking, charging, holding, high sticking, kneeing, check from behind, spearing, unsportsmanlike conduct, too many men on the ice. * When a team is penalized, and depending the severity of the penalty, the opposing team is rewarded a power play; meaning the other team will be short handed for a distinct amount of time (refer to penalties). * If the team on the power plays gets a goal, the power play is now over. * If the short handed team scores while killing the power play, the power play is not over. * A penalty shot is rewarded to the offensive player if he or she is on a breakaway and the defending obstructs the player enough so they do not get a shot off. Obstructions such as hooking, slashing, tripping, and holding. Also, if the goaltender throws his or her stick at the puck or players to prevent a goal, the player will be awarded with a penalty shot. * The puck must completely cross the offensive blue line before any player on the offense completely crosses the blue line. Otherwise, the team is offside. * A faceoff ensues every time there is a stoppage of play. A face off occurs in the centre of the rink at the beginning of each period and after every goal. * Points are rewarded to players who score and assist (primary and secondary) the goal. * Two points (2) are awarded to the winning team in the standings, while the losing team gets zero (0) points, unless they losing team loses in overtime or a shootout then they are awarded one point in standings. * When a goal is scored, even strength (5 vs. 5), the offensive team players on the ice are rewarded with a +1 rating. The defending team players on the ice are given a -1 rating. This statistic in not in effect when teams are on the power play, unless the team that is short handed gets a goal.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If you're talking about convenience fees for when you use a credit card to purchase things like event tickets, pay a parking ticket online, etc... they use those to offset the fee they have to pay for doing the transaction (to the credit card company). They don't charge a straight "credit card fee" because there are a maze of laws surrounding doing this. Instead, they charge a convenience fee to get around those laws. However, to do this, the convenience fee can't simply be the amount of the credit card fee under a renamed fee. So companies will charge more to truly make it a convenience fee so you're not really paying for using your credit card but more for the *convenience* of doing so. There are even restrictions on this, but they're much easier to navigate for the merchants.</TEXT>

A "drop" is a rather imprecise measure, but let's use 16 drops per ml. So, all told, we're looking at approximately 2 * 10^25 drops of water. By some estimates, there are about 10^22 grains of sand on Earth. So there are a lot more drops of water than grains of sand.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>DRIPs are a great way to continue reinvesting your money, but with $900, the payoff is going to be minimal. If you decide to collect the dividends at the time of payout, you'll get the cash. If you reinvest them, you'll buy portions of shares. There are certain types of companies that pay out nice dividends, you just have to do your research and determine what's right for you. I will say, it's tough (but not impossible) to start investing in the stock market with as little as $900 and end up with some serious money.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Subvocalization can definitely lead to slower reading. There are various tips on what you can do to increase your reading speed surrounding subvocalization. To answer your other question, I don't skip anything in books. I like to read everything. For me, it's not about speed. It's about enjoyment. I go through about 80 books/year, and that's fine for me. I have no desire to read more. I like to be able to remember each book I've read, be able to talk about it, etc. If I were to read, say 200 books/year, I feel like I'd lose a lot of what I'd read.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The Knights #8217; armor is unbelievable, unless you use ancient heavy artillery or a modern gun. With only his joints and eyes as weak points, using melee weapons against him is suicide. Arrows and rocks bounce off of him instantly. So, if the pirate is using, say, a cutlass, he'd be at a huge disadvantage. Despite being more nimble, he'd have a hard time dealing the accuracy needed to fell the knight. Eventually, I have to think, the slower knight would deal a crippling blow and emerge victorious. Now, if the pirate has a gun at his disposal, the odds flip flop completely. Needless to day, the pirate most likely wins this one unless he's a terrible shot. Really, we need more qualifiers to more accurately determine who would win this fight. The period in which this hypothetical fight occurs is pretty important, as is the weaponry used by each. Right now, it's simply to broad to present a real answer as to who would be more likely to win the fight.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Baseball Stars circa 1990. My best friend and I played this game continuously whenever he was over. Well, it got to the point where I was winning the majority of the time. Then, one day after he left, I went to play something else, and I noticed Baseball Stars was missing. I questioned him about it, but he denied it. I knew he took it, so I told him we weren't friends until that game was back in my house. We didn't talk for three years. Then, one day, he came to school with the game, apologized, and wanted to know if we could be friends again. We patched things up and are still friends to this day. What once filled me with rage is now a funny anecdote we revisit from time to time.</TEXT>

It fell into the fan, stopping the blades, but the motor was still running. Long story short, the motor got super hot and caused a minor fire. Nothing was damaged except for some carpet (and the fan), so we were lucky there. But I refuse to leave my house with any sort of fan running, no matter what.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The customer is always right because it's considered a poor business practice to potentially drive customers away. In other words, if you just do what the customer says, there's a greater likelihood they'll come back. If you give them trouble, they're more likely to leave for good as well as badmouth your store. Word of mouth is the most impactful marketing. So keeping customers in your good graces is important. That said, there are some places that don't give a crap and do what they want.</TEXT>

There is a special method of signing that is signed into the hand. There is also a method of understanding  amp; learning speech by holding your hand along the side of the face of a person talking to you. And a person can also learn to use Braille. A person who is deafblind can learn to navigate using a white cane like other people who are blind.

    <TEXT>They don't know. I worked at a gas station when I was younger, and this is how it worked at my station. Someone comes up with a $20, asks to fill it up with regular on pump 10. They go pump, tank tops off at $18, say, and they come back for their change. If they used credit, same thing. They get charged after the gas is pumped. No one knows the exact amount of gas they'll need. So when a customer walks to the window with $50 and says fill it up, they're coming back for change. They don't know that they'll need $50 of gas exactly.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If your shirt smelled bad, it could be because it was left in the washer too long after a load was run. I've done this before. Forgotten about a load of wash, and then when I dry the clothes, they have a mildew smell. As for the body odor, it's different for every person. The main thing is washing well. If you do that, you should be good. You can still certainly get BO, and it's worse for some than others. I, for one, sweat like a fiend, but I tend not to "stink" unless I don't shower for a day or two. Just make sure you're showering regularly, and apply some deodorant.

It was only about 5 miles, but I was 10, and my parents were cautious. My dad told me, "Yeah, sure, and pick up some milk at the A amp;P while you're out." I took this as a sign that I was old enough to ride into town. Needless to say, when I got back, my parents were livid as I'd been gone for several hours with my friend. They weren't even happy that I actually stopped and got them milk (with money from the family change jar).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is actually a pretty tough question to answer in an easy manner. It really depends on the type of aircraft you're talking about here, as the results/techniques would be different depending on that information. In general,a true flat spin is near because the center of gravity is too far aft (rear), thus it results in the inability to get the nose down no matter what the controls are set to do. This is very, very general, and there are a TON of factors that you can look into with a Google search, but that's the most simplistic explanation I can offer.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Most people can appreciate how much money and energy went into the Lord of the Rings franchise. However, there are some small details even the most devoted fans may have missed. **#1 - The Chain Mail** For any sci-fi or fantasy film, it's one thing to make the clothing and equipment look autentic onscreen, and another to add layers of detail that are physically impossible to notice, even if each frame of the movie is examined with a magnifying glass. For instance, during the battle of Helm's Deep, tens of thousands of orcs storm the fortress. And if you look at the armor they're wearing, you'll notice *underneath* there's a layer of chain mail. It doesn't stick out a whole bunch, and you barely notice it - if at all - while watching the movies, but that chain mail was created by the costume department by hand, link by link. It took two straight years, without stopping to create the *6 miles* of mail (32,000 feet). [Here's a video of the painstaking process.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyXeHccKTDs) **#2 Even more detail...** Peter Jackson wasn't messing around when it came to putting LoTR on the big screen. And his demand for detail went so far as this... With all of the armor and weapons featured in the films, each race has specific traits and customs, and then within those races, each family has their own designs that are reflected in the equipment they wear. Freeze on a scene in the Elf land of Rivendell and appreciate the [bronze detailing of Legolas' quiver](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/8f/8a/8e/8f8a8e734271226ab6aabe14af1c32a1.jpg), crafted with the lost-wax process. Pause in an Orc battle scene and notice the varieties of helmets, some representing a family's standing within the Orcan culture, others illustrating that Orcs were scavengers who gathered armor and weapons that were dropped on battlefields. Stop on a closeup of a Dwarf and observe the belt buckles with squarish, angular designs that reflect Dwarven architecture. More than 48,000 pieces were made for the first film alone. And even crazier, each one of these helmets has a backstory - rough leather and cracked metal for Orcs of low standing, long and misshapen for Orcs with (more) physical deformities; light helmets for scouts, and heavy bladed ones for berserkers. All this effort just to be strapped onto an anonymous stuntman as he sprints toward a bludgeoning with prop swords. They also crafted 10,000 hand-forged Orcish belt buckles that are virtually impossible to see in the middle of a sprawling CGI-enhanced melee. People don't even notice belt buckles in real life unless they're hanging out at the Double Deuce, so they can't be serious about that "squarish, angular design" nonsense about Dwarf belts.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The  #8220;two spaces after period #8221; rule was established during the days of typesetters, when additional space was needed to show the difference between the spacing between words (which was smaller) and the spacing between sentences (which was larger). When typewriters came around, they had only one font and all the letters were monospaced, or took up the same amount of space. That means that the skinny  #8220;l #8221; and wider  #8220;w #8221; occupied the same amount of space on paper. People mimicked what they believed to be the format they #8217;d grown used to by adopting two spaces after a period #8212;and that #8217;s how the so-called two-space rule was born. With the dawn of computers, word processing programs not only began offering an absurd number of fonts, but each font was programmed to space characters proportionally ( #8220;l #8221; takes up about a third of the space  #8220;w #8221; does). In turn, most computer fonts will automatically give you enough room between sentences with one space. And, according to nearly all stylebooks, including The Associated Press Stylebook and the Chicago Manual of Style, you always use a single space after a period. The point is, it #8217;s not only widely accepted, it #8217;s expected that you use only one space after a period. That said, I was taught to use two in my high school typing class. So it's ingrained. I use two to this day even though it's not necessary.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'll stick with sports and raise you a Wayne Gretzky. The most impressive sports statistic, in my opinion, is this: Gretzky is far and away the points-scored leader in hockey history. He has a grand total of 2,857. Messier is second at 1,887. This means even if you erased every goal Gretzky ever scored in his career, he'd STILL be the points leader by nearly 100 points.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The reason that ants can lift so much is due to a concept of physics known as scaling. In fact the muscles of ants are no stronger than human muscles, but it is their small size that provides their advantage. Ants can lift so much because of the ratio between their body size and body mass; their small size means they do not have a large body mass and the proportion of their mass that is muscle is very high. As a result they are able to lift weights that are many times larger than their own body weight. In comparison elephants have massive size and the proportion of their mass that is muscle is quite low; although they are able to lift incredible weights they are unable to lift or carry their own body weight.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Night vision goggles. Bought them on a lark, thinking they'd be fun for a while. I've used them ever since to scare the shit outta my wife when the house is dark. She hated them and tried to get me to sell them for a long time. Then the power went out in our house for over a week one winter, and she's been okay with them ever since.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I did. It happened when I worked at a retirement community. As you might expect, death is pretty common in these places, but it doesn't usually happen right out in the open. It was during dinner, and suddenly one of the women sitting near the door went super rigid. She looked like she was straining severely, and then she just sort of slumped over. Her husband, who was a retired doctor, got out of his chair and got her on the floor. There was nothing he could do. The in-house nurses rushed down and did what they could. I later learned she had suffered a massive stroke and died pretty quickly. It was damn scary to see something like that firsthand. The saddest part was her husband sitting there with her head in his lap knowing there was nothing he could do.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Americans generally tip for a variety of services. This would include tipping bartenders, waiters, hair dressers, delivery people, etc. I have no problem with tipping for good service. What ticks me off is the level to which tips are expected. For instance, even if a waiter does a crappy job, it's still expected that you give them something. When I've suggested tipping low (or even not at all in rare instances) people act like I'm a dickwad. But like I say, I don't mind tipping. It doesn't bother me at all. I just want good service if I'm going to be giving money to someone and that's what a good portion of their earnings come from. That said, when I was in London, I noticed they don't really tip. I've never been to Australia, but it sounds like the same thing. I remember getting beers in London, and throwing the bartender a tip every time I got a drink. He accepted it, but he looked at me like I was nuts. Then my friends from over there told me the reason. It did feel weird to grab a beer or go out to eat and not really tip. As for taxes, they are what they are. Like you say, they're not included in the shelf price when it comes to goods. But at this point, it's become an automatic calculation in my head.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>SnapChat actually doesn't make any money at all right now. The value is in the user base. That's because the user base, right now, consists of a demographic that's highly coveted by marketers (people between the ages of 13 and 17). So SnapChat as we know it is just the first step. They capture users, and eventually they'll make money by marketing to them. In fact, they have "SnapChat Discovery" in the works that will accomplish just that. However, SnapChat *does* have money because they've been heavily invested in.</TEXT>

He was leaning out the window, and trying to drive while wheeling a bike up the street. I watched him struggle with it for a few minutes out of curiosity before asking him if he needed a hand. I ended up riding the bike up the street for him to a house, and he tried to give me $5. I declined. Now, why couldn't he go park, come back get the bike, and ride it home? No idea.</TEXT>

And I was productive enough... I mean, I have to work to keep my job. But I found that working from a desktop in the office I've since set up in my basement cuts down on distractions and helps me stay more focused on the task at hand. So that's really the only tip I have. Find space to set up an office in your home and keep the TV off.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Every drug has at least three names. First, there's the chemical name, then there's the generic name, and then there is a brand name (sometimes more than one, if it's produced by more than one company). For example, a commonly used diuretic's chemical name is 4-chloro-N-furfuryl-5-sulfamoylanthranilic acid, its generic name is furosemide and its brand name is Lasix. Brand names and, to a lesser extent, generic names, are chosen with great care and often at great expense. Paxil: an antidepressant and anti-anxiety drug (Pax=peace in Latin) Lunesta: a sleeping medication (Luna=moon in Latin) Viagra: a medication for erectile dysfunction (Vi[r]= man in Latin and Agra=field, usually farmed or fertile in Latin and Greek) Fosamax: a drug for osteoporosis, or bone thinning (Os=bone Max=great in Latin) Sometimes, drug names are chosen because of the meaning their sounds imply. For example, several drugs that regulate heart rhythm end in the suffix -olol (propranolol, atenolol, nadolol)--those two echoed syllables mimicking the beating heart. The letters "X," "Z," "N," "Q," and "K" connote cutting edge science, which the makers of Zantac, Nexium, and Protonix (all medicines for acid reflux) wish to convey. "S." "M," "V," "L" and "R" are "soft" letters, which the names of drugs for women are likely to include. Examples are Sarafem (for pre-menstrual syndrome) and Provera and Vivelle (hormone replacements). Many birth control pills employ these letters and sort of sound like women's first names: Junel, Alesse, Apri, Mircette, Yasmin, etc. Medications marketed to men are more likely to contain a "hard" sound like "T," "G," "K" or "X"--like Flomax for enlarged prostate or Levitra, for erectile dysfunction. An exception is Cialis, also for ED and with only soft syllables but with a meaningful classical root (cael=sky in Latin, also connoting "up" or "above," as in "ceiling.") Even when drugs have randomly chosen names, the companies that make them seek assistance. There's actually a website with a program, Drug-o-Matic , that generates names for pharmaceuticals.</TEXT>

One example: Before a test she gave one of her classes, one of the students got his hands on the answer key for the test. He got every question right except for one. After getting his test back, he went up to my friend (his teacher) and told her that there was a mistake. He proceeded to explain to her how he put the same answer as was on the test key. Ratted himself out over getting one question wrong.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If you owe someone money, pay them back *before* you make a big purchase. This is fresh in my mind because it just happened to me. A lifelong friend needed $500 to help meet his rent. He never asks for money, and he had a private issue that caused him to be short on cash, so I knew he needed it. So I give him the money, and he pays his rent. Two weeks later, he gets his paycheck, is back in the swing of things, and I notice he has a new TV in his place. He's since paid me back, but I took it as an affront that he'd go out to buy a new TV before paying back the $500 he owed me. Turns out this practice is far more common than you'd think.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm sick of people complaining about being underpaid... to the point where they're struggling to pay rent, eat, etc. Yet they have no problem going home and watching their cable television, surfing the internet on their $500 smartphones, and maintaining expensive habits like smoking and/or going out every weekend. I hear so many people complain that they don't make enough money, but their prioritization *sucks* when it comes to how they spend that "little" money they make. And I realize this isn't the case for all people. Some folks ARE underpaid and don't have enough to live comfortably. I'm just sick of hearing the ones that do complain about their situations when they could easily be remedied. *Edit: I really seem to have hit a nerve considering some of the posts below and, more so, the several PMs I've received. So let me put some qualifiers here to help clear up what I meant by my above post:* * I am NOT talking about people who have lost their jobs and had to take a significant pay cut. * I am NOT talking about people who bought during the housing crisis and are now underwater. * I am NOT making a blanket statement about smartphones. * I am NOT saying you can't have three television sets. * I am NOT talking about people who make very little money and do the best they can. If you suffered from an unforeseen circumstance, and you're in financial difficulty because of it, that sucks. And I understand that. I understand shit happens and you need to make adjustments. The people I am referring to in my post, however, are those who make enough to live comfortably but *choose* not to and then act like it's not their own fault. And this has *nothing* to do with income past a certain point. As I said in one of my comments below, there are athletes who make millions, then five years later they're filing for bankruptcy. Why? Because they felt they needed a half million dollar Bentley, a mansion, and five other cars. They partied every night and blew their money on myriad things. And then they act like the victims (not in all cases to be sure, but in some). These are the people I'm faulting. Using things like top-level cable packages, smartphones, and laptops was just my way of listing examples. It could be an SUV, an in-ground swimming pool, etc. They're just examples. I'm not making blanket statements about any items in particular. My point is, if you can afford it and live comfortably, more power to you. If you can't, but you still decide to spend your money on those things, then don't complain that you're not making enough.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I wasn't saying there aren't circumstances that might get in the way of people making the most of their money. I'm saying that I hear too many people complain about not having enough cash, when in fact, they make poor financial decisions. For instance, I have a co-worker who does exactly this. He complains that he doesn't make enough. And maybe that's true. Maybe he deserves more. But that doesn't change the fact that he DOES make enough to live comfortably. Instead, he is constantly going out after work to happy hour, owns an Apple laptop in addition to his work-furnished laptop, watches every fight on pay-per-view, and has three TVs in his home. He's a nice dude, and I like hanging out with him, but damn, I get sick of hearing his complaints about money. No one, including the government or "old people," as you say, forced him to purchase three TVs, watch pay-per-view, go out all the time, and own a $1,500 laptop when our work provides him with one. These are all personal choices that directly effect how much money he has left for rent, food, etc. Those are the type of people I'm referencing. Not everyone who has a smartphone and not people who are in a tough situation legitimately.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>First off, I'm not old. I'm in my 20's. And I suffer from all the plights you mention. The strange thing is, you're not understanding what I'm saying. I NEVER said people aren't entitled to earn luxury good through labor. I'm saying you have no right to complain if you make $1,000 per week and you spend $800 of that on needless things. It's just silly. I lived comfortably when I was 21 and made $30,000 per year. Why? Because I made smart decisions. I paid my rent and bought groceries *before* worrying about what phone I had. I paid my bills *before* worrying about needing an iPod or some other such device. Yet there are people my age making $60,000 per year who claim they are underpaid. And while that may be the case (I can't determine what dollar figure anyone deserves), they could also stand to make the most of the their money. Saying this isn't true is like saying a 20-year old athlete who earns $1 million per year doesn't make enough because he likes to blow it on super expensive jewelry, owns 10 cars, and has a 25-room mansion... then chalking up to the "plights" of the younger generation. If you don't get this, then you're simply one of the folks out there spending too much on shit you can't afford. And your offense at what I've been saying tells me that you are.</TEXT>

There are 50-year-old people out there who mismanage their money along with the younger people he so stoutly defends. And I'm glad he does. I'm young. I like the idea that I can spend my money irresponsibly and people like him will take up my cause. But really, I was talking about a multi-generational inability to manage money properly.

I mean, I could go on eBay right now and find thousands of very cheap phones. You can even find cheap smartphones if you feel that you absolutely cannot live without one. Plus, there are any number of pre-paid options out there that can be much cheaper than any plan going. But that's not how many people are. Many people want to have the latest tech so they can brag, show off, and have top-of-the-line phone perks. To me, that's insane. If was still making $30k per year, you can bet your ass I'd be on eBay finding a cheap phone. And that's where I get frustrated. I'd never walk into someone's home and be like, "Man, you keep complaining about money, but you have a fridge. C'mon man, stop overspending." But when someone keeps complaining about cash, and they make $60k a year, maybe it's time to buy a cheaper laptop instead of a Mac, or maybe instead of the newest Galaxy model, find something out there that makes more budgetary sense. But, really, to take one portion of what I said in my post and use that as fodder to rebut me doesn't make much sense. Substitute anything in for that line you wish. Put buying a Land Rover in there when you should be buying a Honda Fit. The message of my thread was everything that I typed all together. The meaning is there, and it's not to be derived from a single example I used. That's taking things out of context.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You know, points like this really make me realize how deep this problem runs in our country. You're not entitled to shit. Take a step back for a moment and realize that. When I was 20 and making a shit paycheck, I never once felt entitled to own a BMW and a top-of-the-line computer. I didn't even have a cell for the longest time because I knew I couldn't meet the payments. I'm making these judgments based on my own experience. I was poor in regards to what my salary was, but I made it work. And I never felt pissed or upset that I couldn't afford the nicer things other people had. Taking specific examples I used to make an argument is useless. They're only there to make a point and list potential things people might not need to spend money on. And to your last point, I NEVER said poor people aren't allowed to have nice stuff. I'm just saying people in general need to prioritize better. It's utter shit that Americans, many of them at least, feel so entitled to anything they want. The wake up call is this: No matter what kind of utopia you imagine where any and everyone is entitled to the same stuff is absolutely nuts. I mean, I guess I offended you for some reason, but that wasn't the intention. The point is this: If you make $10k per year, you should live like you make $10k. Don't finance a big screen TV and then complain you can't pay rent. If you make $30k per year, you should live like you make $30k. Don't finance a Land Rover and then complain when you can't pay rent. If you make $100k per year, you should live like you make $100k. Don't finance an enormous house and then complain when you can't make the payments. This isn't about poor and rich. It's about being smart with your money. It's not that hard, but as I can see from posts like yours, this is a very, very serious issue... probably more so than I ever imagined when making what I thought was an innocuous post.</TEXT>

You're totally entitled to own a laptop even if it means not being able to pay your bills. Just get back to me when you get that money." "Well, that's the thing. I need the newest Galaxy phone too, so next month is out." "Oh, that makes sense. You might not make $100k per year, BUT you ARE entitled to that phone. Just pay rent whenever since you're definitely in need of those other things."</TEXT>

First, she insisted on keeping Explorer because she "could remember it easier since it's just an "E" on the screen." Second, she told me the reason she got mixed up is because Word and Explorer are both letters (with Word having a "W" on its icon).</TEXT>

One of my friends had a similar reaction, but he's also the action/adventure, Transformers kind of movie watcher. Movies like Boyhood, at the risk of sounding pompous, aren't for everyone. And I 'd actually argue against the abusive father stereotype. I thought it actually went against the grain there. Usually these figures come back into the picture for some devious reason, continue to fuck up, and cause hell. Instead, the father comes back into the picture and seems to be trying to actually make good. He ends up starting a family, trading his car in for a minivan, and seems pretty content leading a more "normal" life.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yep, the idea that "glass flows," like you say is a myth. There is a fundamental structural divide between amorphous solids (including glasses) and crystalline solids. Structurally, glasses are similar to liquids, but that doesn't mean they are liquid. It is possible that the "glass is a liquid" urban legend originated with a misreading of a German treatise on glass thermodynamics. Pulled the above from [here](http://dwb.unl.edu/Teacher/NSF/C01/C01Links/www.ualberta.ca/~bderksen/florin.html) to help articulate my point better. Plus, at that link, there's everything you'll ever need to know about is glass a liquid vs. a solid.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Because basketball and football are far more accessible. That's the simple answer. In places that have a larger percentage of African-Americans, like inner cities, it's easy to pick up a ball and play either. You can play with a few people and minimal equipment is needed. Baseball - You need a lot of people to play to fill out two teams, and it can get expensive (bats, gloves, etc.) Hockey - It's damn expensive (pads, sticks, etc.)</TEXT>

But there are some things you could look for in terms of trying to determine if you're being catfished. - If the person has a super broad interest base, meaning they seem to like everything, it could be a bad sign. Some people like a ton of stuff, but catfishers in particular, so they can relate to just about anyone. - If they refuse to use a service like Skype, especially after you've been messaging back and forth for a decent amount of time. - If they aren't dependable and it's because of their "job." - If they ask for money or being telling sob stories in which a financial boost would help them out. - If they've contacted you first (especially out of nowhere) and you don't know them or have any friends in common. - If they don't have multiple pictures showing their face or they don't have pictures in various settings or with various friends. At this point, almost anyone online should have multiple pictures. - If their profile picture is of a very good looking person... a person who looks like they could be a model. - If you have ANY suspicion because something doesn't "feel" right</TEXT>

    <TEXT>They are not the same thing. Pancake batter has a rising agent in it (like baking powder/soda), whereas a crepe does not. Pancakes are thicker and fluffier, while crepes are thin and flat. The methods for making them also differ.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>With crepes, you want them to be perfectly uniform. So it's a slightly more laborious process in leveling out the batter. You don't have to do this, but it makes for a much better crepe. Also you don't need to flip a crepe. It cooks through because of the thinness. You can just fold it in half and throw in whatever fillings you want. With pancakes, you ordinarily just plop whatever amount of batter you want in the pan and let it cook on one side. Then you flip and cook through.</TEXT>

Bathroom door was locked. I realllllllly had to go, so I dropped trou behind the dumpster behind the station. Bad move. I ended up shitting on - not near - a fire ant hill. Results were not good. Add into this that I never considered toilet paper. And it was one of those lava hot poops. I still have dreams about it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Often police will align the center of their own car with the left edge of the vehicle they've pulled over. This provides an "alley" for the officer to walk to the violator's vehicle, thereby protecting him/her from being sideswiped while handling the situation. A variation on this that you'll often see is the police car angled to the right, with the wheels turned sharply to the right. This provides an even wider "alley" and an easier exit from the police car.</TEXT>

They sold all manner of things, and my golden goose was their nice array of porn magazines. I would steal four or so of them, bring them to middle school with me, and sell them. I never got caught stealing them... and I never got caught selling them. This went on for about 3 years, so it's always amazed me that I got away with it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There is a science to it revolving around vibrational harmonics, but mostly, it's for design aesthetics. 5 spokes makes the rim casting process slightly simpler compared to higher spoke numbers, and is generally more aesthetically pleasing than 3 spokes (and easier to produce than 7, 11, or more spokes). Also, the number of wheel lugs a car requires is dependent on its size. Common numbers for passenger vehicles range from 3 - 6. The most common configuration for performance vehicles is 5 lug nuts. Matching the number of spokes to lug nuts is aesthetically pleasing, and rims are predominately an aesthetic product.</TEXT>

Even with eggs, meat, dairy, there's a good three or four days in which the food is still good after the date on the label. Really, it boils down to common sense. Is the egg green? Does it smell weird? Is the meat rotting? Is it discolored? Does the milk have chunks? As long as you're not an idiot and practice proper food storage, you can tell whether a food is actually spoiled or not. It drives me crazy how much food is wasted because it's one day past the expiration date.</TEXT>

So he ordered bunks that he then had to put together. He didn't jump into those, but he didn't get it quite right either. He missed a few screws, and my brother fell through the top bed on the first night, crushing me in the process. So he paid to have someone come and install them for him.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In the words of Ice Cube: "Rock  amp; roll is not an instrument; rock  amp; roll is not even a style of music. Rock  amp; roll is a spirit.  #8230; It's been going since the blues, jazz, bebop, soul, R amp;B, rock  amp; roll, heavy metal, punk rock and, yes, hip-hop. And what connects us all is that spirit.  #8230;Rock  amp; roll is not conforming to the people who came before you, but creating your own path in music and in life." In other words: It's probably worth mentioning what "rock and roll" actually is. There are two definitions of "rock and roll". The first definition is a genre popular of music that originated in the early to mid 1950s and ended in 1959, because of the following events: - The drafting of Elvis into the army (1958) - Little Richard retiring to become a preacher (1959) - The arrest of Chuck Berry (1959) - The scandal of Jerry Lee Lewis marrying his underage cousin (1958) - The death of Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens, and The Big Bopper in a plane crash (1959) - The payola scandal that rocked (no pun intended) the music industry, taking down a number of well-known rock and roll DJs, including Alan Freed, with it (1959) Under this definition, "rock music" is a genre of music that began with "rock and roll" and branched out in a number of different ways. This definition also implies that the vast majority of the artists in the Rock and Roll Hall Of Fame shouldn't be in there, because they're not, strictly speaking, "rock and roll". They're a different rock sub-genre, like metal or grunge or surf rock or punk. The second definition has the same start date, but essentially doesn't end, and instead somehow becomes the same as the all-encompassing genre of "rock", spawning all the sub-genres. It should be noted that early 1960s rock sounds fairly different than the rock and roll that ended under the assumptions of the first definition, as surf rock, and soul, the two biggest subgenres to originate around that time. With the two different definitions of rock and roll established, there are certainly other acts that aren't "rock and roll" or "rock" that are in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Blues - Albert King - Bobby "Blue" Bland - Jimmy Reed - John Lee Hooker - Muddy Waters Reggae - Bob Marley - Jimmy Cliff Jazz - Charlie Christian - Miles Davis Disco - Bee Gees (they were soft rock in the early 70s, but it's safe to say their disco stuff got them in) - Donna Summer Pop - Abba - Madonna - Michael Jackson And then there's the question of other genres, like Soul, Funk, Rhythm and blues, etc. Are these "rock and roll"? What about soft/folk rock, like Crosby, Stills,  amp; Nash or The Byrds or James Taylor? Are they "rock and roll"? What makes these artists and genres "rock and roll" but rap not? I don't think anything does, really. I think the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame is really more about popular music than "rock and roll" or "rock", per se; it just started with the 1950s rock and roll era and moved forward. But we can also look toward the Rock Hall for more information. First, you have their article entitled "Planet Rock: Hip Hop is Rock and Roll". As further evidence, look towards the eligibility requirements for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame:  gt;To be eligible for induction as an artist (as a performer, composer, or musician) into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, the artist must have released a record, in the generally accepted sense of that phrase, at least 25 years prior to the year of induction; and have demonstrated unquestionable musical excellence.  gt;We shall consider factors such as an artist's musical influence on other artists, length and depth of career and the body of work, innovation and superiority in style and technique, but musical excellence shall be the essential qualification of induction. Note that there is no stipulation of genre. All influential artists who have demonstrated unquestionable musical excellence are considered. Also, looking at that page, you'll see  gt;Ballots are then sent to an international voting body of more than 600 artists, historians and members of the music industry. I think this is the most important insight. 600 people decide what "rock and roll" within the scope of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame is. They have opened it up to fans to vote, but the top 5 artists by fan vote count for one ballot each. So, essentially, fan votes don't count, and 600 people choose what "music excellence" is and how "influential" and "innovative" an artist was.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Women and girls are ensnared in sex trafficking in a variety of ways. Some are lured with offers of legitimate and legal work as shop assistants or waitresses. Others are promised marriage, educational opportunities and a better life. Still others are sold into trafficking by boyfriends, friends, neighbors or even parents. Trafficking victims often pass among multiple traffickers, moving further and further from their home countries. Women often travel through multiple countries before ending at their final destination. For example, a woman from the Ukraine may be sold to a human trafficker in Turkey, who then passes her on to a trafficker in Thailand. Along the way she becomes confused and disoriented. Typically, once in the custody of traffickers, a victim's passport and official papers are confiscated and held. Victims are told they are in the destination country illegally, which increases victims' dependence on their traffickers. Victims are often kept in captivity and also trapped into debt bondage, whereby they are obliged to pay back large recruitment and transportation fees before being released from their traffickers. Many victims report being charged additional fines or fees while under bondage, requiring them to work longer to pay off their debts.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Communication with submarines is difficult because radio waves do not travel well through good electrical conductors like salt water. The obvious solution is to surface and raise an antenna above the sea level, then use ordinary radio transmissions. However, a submarine is most vulnerable when on the surface. Early submarines mostly traveled on the surface, diving mainly to evade immediate threats because of their limited underwater speed and endurance. During the Cold War, however, nuclear-powered submarines were developed that could stay submerged for months. To communicate with submerged submarines a few techniques are used. - Acoustic transmission - Very low frequency - Extremely low frequency</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Most of the stars ARE shining with a steady light. The movement of air (sometimes called turbulence) in the atmosphere of Earth causes the starlight to get slightly bent as it travels from the distant star through the atmosphere down to us on the ground. This means that some of the light reaches us directly and some gets bent slightly away. To our eyes, this makes the star seem to twinkle. You will notice that stars closer to the horizon will appear to twinkle more than other stars. This is because there is a lot more atmosphere between you and a star near the horizon than between you and a star higher in the sky.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Nomenclature is the system of scientific names for taxa (such as species, genera, or families) and the rules and conventions for the formation, treatment, and use of those names. It follows an internationally agreed, quasi-legal procedure. Taxonomy is the identification and interpretation of natural groups of organisms (i.e., taxa) based on characters (such as morphology, genetics, behaviour, ecology). The discovery and delimitation of taxa is a science. Nomenclature and taxonomy are closely allied, but separate aspects ordering information about biodiversity. They overlap in the definition of type specimens, which tie the name to a single physical standard.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>While a firearm is not usually left at the scene of a crime, a bullet quite often is found at the crime scene. Fortunately, forensics experts do have a number of techniques and tools at their disposal to identify a bullet from a specific firearm. A bullet would carefully be collected to initially compare it to a certain firearm. Then, forensics experts would investigate to see if the bullet coincides with the calibre of the firearm in question. After, the bullet would be analysed to see if the rifling impressions pattern is the same pattern of rifling in the barrel of the firearm being investigated. Assuming the two match up on these aspects, forensic scientists would then attempt to match unique, individual characteristics that can transfer from the firearm barrel to the bullet. The transferred characteristics are quite interesting and actually look a bit like a bar code, due to the pattern of striations and scratches. They are also visible when viewed through a microscope. Inside the gun barrel, there are imperfections that cause striations on the projectiles. If you picture the bullet moving down through the barrel of the gun, unique striations are left on the bullet due to those imperfections on the surface inside the gun. Forensic scientists can look at these patterns through various forensic science procedures. If police can find a potential weapon used in a crime, forensic experts can then analyse the striations on the bullet, which occurred during its passage through the gun. This allows forensic scientists to run test bullets through the gun to compare the resulting marks with the recovered bullets. In cases where the bullet is too mangled to observe striations or no gun is recovered, police would have to employ other strategies for linking up a suspect with a crime.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>IT is most unlikely that a parachute will be of use if a passenger plane crashes. Even a plane-load of active military parachutists takes several minutes of reasonably steady flight to exit. Parachuting takes nerve, skill, and strength. One has to force oneself into a 150 mph slipstream, hold a posture that stops one tangling with the parachute as it opens, steer clear of one's fellows and land safely. I shudder to think what the casualty list would be if a typical group of passengers were to attempt their first descents in an emergency. The average man, woman or child in a Boeing would stand a better chance of survival riding the plane down.</TEXT>

In babies that are born extremely premature, the brain doesn't have time to develop and mature enough to produce that instinct and they have to be taught how to suck, swallow, and breathe all at the same time. As they get older, the brain matures even more, and their jaw muscles become stronger, and that allows them to start chewing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The answer is likely due to brain anatomy. Incoming smells are first processed by the olfactory bulb, which starts inside the nose and runs along the bottom of the brain. The olfactory bulb has direct connections to two brain areas that are strongly implicated in emotion and memory: the amygdala and hippocampus. Interestingly, visual, auditory (sound), and tactile (touch) information do not pass through these brain areas. This may be why olfaction, more than any other sense, is so successful at triggering emotions and memories</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A traditional mortgage is used to buy or refinance a home. The lender lends you the money to buy or refinance the home. In exchange, you promise to pay back the lender the money you borrowed, plus interest, over many years. A reverse mortgage is typically used to get cash out of your home. Instead of borrowing to buy a home, you are borrowing against a home that you already own. This allows you to use the cash now for expenses, and pay back the loan when you die or sell the home.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You've got multiple methods for that. Let's make an analog here: A battery is like a tank of water, with a faucet at the bottom. You can make the battery 'do work' by opening the faucet and holding e.g. a small water weel underneath it. You can't look into the tank: how do you know how much water is left? One of the simplest (to implement) methods is by measuring the voltage. In the tank example, you do this by looking at the pressure the water has when you open the faucet. If the tank is full, the water pressure will be bigger than when the tank is empty, and by looking at it, you can guess how much of the tank still is full. Batteries work the same way, for example an 1.5V battery may be 1.6V when full and 1.1V when almost empty. A digital device will take this voltage and will look up how much power a battery usually has left at that point. That then gets showed to the user. The other way is to just calculate how much energy the battery has left by measuring how much energy you've already counted. The tank equivalent would be by putting a measuring device that can measure the amount of liters that flow out of the tank. If your tank holds 100 liters at full capacity and the measuring device indicates 50 liters are already used, you know the tank still is half full. In battery technology, the 'measuring device' that does this is called a coulomb counter, and you can find them e.g. in smartphones. They don't always work as expected (but usually are quite precise): for example, they won't see if energy from a battery disappears in another way. For example, LiIon batteries will lose quite some power from being used at low temperatures, and the coulomb couter doesn't catch that. You can see that because some phones tend to go from half-full to almost completely dead in seconds when they are used in a cold environment.

    <TEXT>A credit score is a number that third parties, especially lenders, use to assess the risk of lending you money. The score is one way banks, credit card companies and other institutions assess the likelihood that you can or will be able to pay off any debts you accumulate. A higher credit score indicates that your current financial circumstances and your historical behavior demonstrate a willingness and ability to pay off any loans you may be approved for. In the United States the credit scoring system you will hear about most is the FICO score, a score used by the major credit agencies to rate your creditworthiness. Your FICO score will be between 300 and 850 with a higher score being better. When it comes to your credit, lenders may sometimes refer to it in terms of Credit Level or Credit Quality such as Poor, Fair/Average, Good or Excellent with each category referring to a range of FICO scores. - Poor credit is considered anyone with a FICO score under 630. - Average or Fair credit rating will be between 630 and 690 - Good Credit is between 690 and 720 - Excellent credit is anything above 720. Your credit score can have an effect in two ways: Whether you can get approved for a financial product in the first place, and what interest rates you may have to pay if you are approved. The higher your FICO score the more likely you are to get approved for a credit card or loan, and will usually reduce the interest rate associated with that particular loan or card. Lower scores may disqualify you for a product or service completely and can raise your interest rates significantly otherwise.</TEXT>

Well poor Bob walked off the edge of a cliff, Bob did this before he had offspring. Well if Bob had lived today he would have glasses or contacts or whatever and he would avoid the cliff, so Bob would live long enough to reproduce. The Bob of today gets to pass on his faulty genes and make little Bobs and Bobettes who can't see either. The Bob of yesteryear didn't get that chance.

    <TEXT>Back in the late 1600's, the Dutch invented the two-sheet mold. The average maximum stretch of an experienced vatman's arms was 44". Many molds at that time were around 17" front to back because the laid lines and watermarks had to run from left to right. Sounds big?...well to maximize the efficiency of paper making, a sheet this big was made, and then quartered, forming four 8.5" x 11" pieces. This was well before paper machines dominated hand made paper labor. A couple centuries later when machines dominated the trade (although many hand made paper makers still existed), and the United States decided on a standard paper size, they stuck with the same size so as to keep the hand made paper makers in business. Oddly enough, the United States used two different sizes - the 8" x 10.5" and the 8.5" x 11". Separate committees came up with separate standards, the 8" x 10.5" for the government and the 8.5" x 11" for the rest of us. Once these committees found out about each other a couple years later, they agreed to disagree until the early 1980's when Reagan finally proclaimed that the 8.5" x 11" was the official standard sized paper. United States History Not until World War I or shortly after was a standard paper size agreed to in the United States. Interestingly enough, within six months of each other, two different paper sizes were set as the standard; one for the government and one for the rest of us. 1. In 1921, the first director of the Bureau of the Budget established an interagency advisory group with the President's approval called the Permanent Conference on Printing which established the 8" x 10 #189;" as the general U.S. government letterhead standard. This extended an earlier establishment made by the former President Hoover, the Secretary of Commerce at the time, who established the 8" x 10 #189;" as the standard letterhead size for his department. 2. Now, during the same year, a Committee on the Simplification of Paper Sizes consisting of printing industry representatives was appointed to work with the Bureau of Standards as part of Hoover's program for the Elimination of Waste in Industry. This group came up with basic sizes for all types of printing and writing papers. The size for "letter" was a 17" x 22" sheet while the "legal" size was 17" x 28" sheet. The later known U.S. letter format was these sizes halved (8  #189;" x 11" and 8  #189;" by 14"). Even in the selection of the 8  #189;" x 11", no special analysis was made to prove this was the optimum size for commercial letterhead. The Committee that developed the sizes did so using one objective - "to reduce inventory requirements for paper into sizes which would cut from a minimum trimming waste.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well, there are quite a few contributing factors that make memory storage and retrieval near-impossible for infants; there is no definite concrete reason, but there are lots of presumptions based on research. 1. The brain substrates are not nearly developed enough; specifically, the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus which are both immature at birth, are critical in encoding memories. We are simply not biologically equipped to store memories in the first few years of life. 2. The sense of "cognitive self" has not yet developed; that is, a child is not yet entirely self-aware, and cannot necessarily "think" to itself, to say things like "remember that time when..." It's similar to watching a cat interact with a mirror; it takes a while before many animals can acknowledge the existence of self, and interact with said existence. 3. There is no mastery of language; children, particularly infants, are still mastering basic language skills and heuristic understanding of the world. People who claim to have memories of "dark and wet" in the womb cannot possibly have such a thing, because the words "dark and wet", were not yet heuristic constructs by which sensory inputs are encoded. So yes, you definitely did experience dark and wet, but without knowing what dark and wet is, it's not necessarily possible that your brain could (1) encode the experience of such an environment or (2) recall it. It's like storing a random file in your computer with no name, no labels, no information and no content. How are you supposed to interpret it when you retrieve it (if ever)? 4. Other cognitive principles are undeveloped; there are several other cognitive learning stages that need to be reached before solid memory encoding and retrieval can occur, such as object permanence (pay attention to this one; it's nearly impossible to have non-instinct based interactions if you don't understand object permanence), self-concept, theory of mind, language, and operative/working memory.</TEXT>

Non-social insects like flies simply don't need to develop that type of intelligence and so they fall lower on the scale. That's very simplified, though. It varies wildly from insect to insect. Many studies have been done on many different insects. It would be incredibly time-consuming to post them all here. I would suggest looking up insects you're interested in and see what the deal is. Bees are superbly fascinating. Even the idea of intelligence is constantly refuted. It's the same in studies with birds. What does it actually mean to be intelligent? What characteristics do you need in order to even be considered intelligent? If you're truly interested, it's a fascinating topic, and there are tons of books/articles out there.

    <TEXT>Size is part of the equation as others have said... Other factors are: 1. Ships generally operate in the ocean and high seas, whereas boats tend to operate more in smaller / restricted water areas (like ferries and towing vessels). 2. Technologically, boats are simple vessels with less complicated equipment, systems and operational maintenance requirements. Since ships are required to be operable for longer time-duration and travel across oceans, they are manned using advanced engineering, heavy machinery, and navigational systems. 3. Crew is a major difference. Ships are huge in size and therefore they are operated by professionally trained navigators and engineers. A ship requires a captain to operate the ship and guide the crew. On the other hand, the size of the crew on a boat depends on the size of the boat. It can be one person or a full-fledged crew depending on the size and purpose of the boat. 4. A boat is a small to mid-sized vessel, which has much lesser cargo carrying capability as compared to a ship. Ships are specifically made to carry cargo or passengers or boats, whereas boat is a generic term used for a variety of water crafts. Mainly boats are used for recreational purposes, fishing, or ferry people. 5. When it comes to construction and design, ships are complicated structures having a variety of machinery systems and designing aspects for safety and stability of the ship. A boat is much simple in construction and build, and has lesser machines and design complexities. 6. A boat can be powered by sails, motor, or human force, whereas a ship has dedicated engines to propel them.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The nerves in your hand get much more sensitive when they're cold. Also, your veins constrict, and blood runs less to your extremities and more to your vital organs to preserve heat. This makes your skin more rigid, which causes pressure to be applied to these already sensitive nerves. So everything is getting less blood flow, which also makes it harder to make precise or repetitive movements (texting when it's cold). So all these make for a more painful experience when your fingers get hit when they're really cold. Compare the warm, soft hands with good padding and flexibility to cold, rigid, blood-deprived hands. Also, your muscles are a lot tighter and less "mobile", and it's easier to cause injury when your muscles are tense.

As the object gains velocity there comes a time when the force of the air resistance is enough to balance the force of gravity, so the acceleration stops and the raindrop attains terminal velocity (maximum velocity). Rain drops are only 0.5 mm-4 mm in diameter. Their terminal velocity is only about 10 m/s ( 20 mph ). That #8217;s the maximum speed that they can travel in air irrespective of their initial height. Edit: Also the mass of the rain drop is about a few milligrams. Hence, the force that it exerts on the body is really small, small enough that it doesn't hurt at all when it hits us.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Crying stimulates the production of endorphins, our body #8217;s natural pain killer and  #8220;feel-good #8221; hormones. #8221; So it's our natural biological response to cry. Crying is also universal and people are attuned to it; when you cry, people want to help. Therefore you learn to cry in order to garner aid (or you learn that crying doesn't always ensure someone will help you.) So it's both a natural response, and learned.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Most wine actually doesn't taste better with age. But for those that do, this is the quick and dirty explanation: Tannins, acids, and other compounds bind together chemically and get heavier, thus "falling out of the wine". This leaves sediment in the bottom but also leads to mellower, softer, more complex wines. Many wines that get much better with age are brash and unapproachable in their youth - often times due to high tannin levels or high acid levels. If you have successfully aged a wine worthy of aging, what you will be rewarded with is a wine that is very different than what it was prior to aging. Important factors in the aging of wine include temperature, exposure to light, and humidity</TEXT>

    <TEXT>See, plants engage in specific behaviors in both breeding and simply staying alive. Plants have shown the ability to "ration" food sources and have even proven the capacity to "recognize" their relatives. It's more than a series of chemical processes. Same with bacteria. They both sense and respond accordingly to their environments. Rocks have no such capability (to stick with the original object you brought up). They simply are where they are and have formed through no actual cognizance on their own part. Rocks are defined by the environments in which they exist, they don't adapt to survive in specific areas and propagate.</TEXT>

It WAS weird when she told me she had hooked up with the girl I was dating my senior year (WHILE I was dating her). We laugh about it now, but it was weird when she told me because the last person I was expecting my girlfriend to cheat on me with was my sister.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Okay, let's just take a step back for second. And this is the last I'll say on the matter... The OP asked a question that was going to get subjective responses. I replied with something that annoyed me, and that was it. You assumed I was dragging Trump through the mud. Really, I could have chosen from myriad other quotes had I wanted to do that. I simply replied with a subjective answer. Then, you came in as the herald of context. First, the question didn't ask for context. It simply asked what we found annoying. Second, you had the audacity to then apply your own context to my response while chiding me for taking something out of context (which I didn't do, I just quoted a person and listed when it was said). So, really, you're all bent out of shape for no reason. I found something annoying, you didn't. Big whoop. I never asked you to agree with me, and if you think I'm an idiot for thinking something someone said was annoying, that's fine. You're entitled to your feelings. If you had just said, "I disagree, that's crazy," that would have been totally fine. But you came in and just started applying your own filters to things which doesn't work for a thread relying on subjective answers.</TEXT>
